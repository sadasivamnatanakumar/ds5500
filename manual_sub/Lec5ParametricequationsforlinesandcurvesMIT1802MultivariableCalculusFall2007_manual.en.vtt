00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.947
So -- So, yesterday we learned
about the questions of planes

00:00:28.947 --> 00:00:33.679
and how to think of 3x3 linear
systems in terms of

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:38.508
intersections of planes and how
to think about them

00:00:38.508 --> 00:00:42.619
geometrically.
And, that in particular led us

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:47.050
to see which cases actually we
don't have a unique solution to

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.964
the system,
but maybe we have no solutions

00:00:49.964 --> 00:00:53.186
or infinitely many solutions
because maybe the line at

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:56.713
intersection of two of the
planes happens to be parallel to

00:00:56.713 --> 00:01:02.544
the other plane.
So, today, we'll start by

00:01:02.544 --> 00:01:08.920
looking at the equations of
lines.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:18.471
And, so in a way it seems like
something which we've already

00:01:18.471 --> 00:01:28.508
seen last time because we have
seen that we can think of a line

00:01:28.508 --> 00:01:34.660
as the intersection of two
planes.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.989
And, we know what equations of
planes look like.

00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:42.724
So, we could describe a line by
two equations telling us about

00:01:42.724 --> 00:01:46.140
the two planes that intersect on
the line.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.976
But that's not the most
convenient way to think about

00:01:48.976 --> 00:01:51.485
the line usually,
though, because when you have

00:01:51.485 --> 00:01:53.940
these two questions,
have you solve them?

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.590
Well, OK, you can,
but it takes a bit of effort.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.789
So, instead,
there is another representation

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:07.500
of a line.
So, if you have a line in

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.650
space, well, you can imagine may
be that you have a point on it.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.810
And, that point is moving in
time.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.889
And, the line is the trajectory
of a point as time varies.

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:33.910
So, think of a line as the
trajectory of a moving point.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:44.797
And, so when we think of the
trajectory of the moving point,

00:02:44.797 --> 00:02:51.810
that's called a parametric
equation.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:03:01.087
OK, so we are going to learn
about parametric equations of

00:03:01.087 --> 00:03:07.138
lines.
So, let's say for example that

00:03:07.138 --> 00:03:13.964
we are looking at the line.
So, to specify a line in space,

00:03:13.964 --> 00:03:18.754
I can do that by giving you two
points on the line or by giving

00:03:18.754 --> 00:03:22.539
you a point and a vector
parallel to the line.

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:28.227
For example,
so let's say I give you two

00:03:28.227 --> 00:03:35.227
points on the line:
(-1,2,2), and the other point

00:03:35.227 --> 00:03:40.368
will be (1,3,-1).
So, OK, it's pretty good

00:03:40.368 --> 00:03:43.919
because we have two points in
that line.

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:46.620
Now, how do we find all the
other points?

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.270
Well, the other points in
between these guys and also on

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.434
either side.
Let's imagine that we have a

00:03:54.434 --> 00:04:00.095
point that's moving on the line,
and at time zero,

00:04:00.095 --> 00:04:03.321
it's here at Q0.
And, in a unit time,

00:04:03.321 --> 00:04:05.280
I'm not telling you what the
unit is.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.116
It could be a second.
It could be an hour.

00:04:08.116 --> 00:04:12.650
It could be a year.
At t=1, it's going to be at Q1.

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.539
And, it moves at a constant
speed.

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:17.329
So, maybe at time one half,
it's going to be here.

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.329
Times two, it would be over
there.

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.480
And, in fact,
that point didn't start here.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.120
Maybe it's always been moving
on that line.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.060
At time minus two,
it was down there.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:51.550
So, let's say Q(t) is a moving
point, and at t=0 it's at Q0.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.483
And, let's say that it moves.
Well, we couldn't make it move

00:04:55.483 --> 00:04:58.183
in any way we want.
But, probably the easiest to

00:04:58.183 --> 00:05:02.135
find, so our role is going to
find formulas for a position of

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:06.036
this moving point in terms of t.
And, we'll use that to say,

00:05:06.036 --> 00:05:08.422
well,
any point on the line is of

00:05:08.422 --> 00:05:12.587
this form where you have to plug
in the current value of t

00:05:12.587 --> 00:05:16.240
depending on when it's hit by
the moving point.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:24.115
So, perhaps it's easiest to do
it if we make it move at a

00:05:24.115 --> 00:05:31.709
constant speed on the line,
and that speed is chosen so

00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:36.350
that at time one,
it's at Q1.

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:56.894
So, the question we want to
answer is, what is the position

00:05:56.894 --> 00:06:03.279
at time t, so,
the point Q(t)?

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:08.871
Well, to answer that we have an
easy observation,

00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:15.861
which is that the vector from
Q0 to Q of t is proportional to

00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:23.953
the vector from Q0 to Q1.
And, what's the proportionality

00:06:23.953 --> 00:06:27.970
factor here?
Yeah, it's exactly t.

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:34.310
At time one,
Q0 Q is exactly the same.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.650
Maybe I should draw another
picture again.

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:43.863
I have Q0.
I have Q1, and after time t,

00:06:43.863 --> 00:06:56.299
I'm here at Q of t where this
vector from Q0 Q(t) is actually

00:06:56.299 --> 00:07:04.589
going to be t times the vector
Q0 Q1.

00:07:04.589 --> 00:07:09.930
So, when t increases,
it gets longer and longer.

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:15.769
So, does everybody see this now?
Is that OK?

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:24.149
Any questions about that?
Yes?

00:07:24.149 --> 00:07:26.200
OK, so I will try to avoid
using blue.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:37.295
Thanks for, that's fine.
So, OK, I will not use blue

00:07:37.295 --> 00:07:42.655
anymore.
OK, well, first let me just

00:07:42.655 --> 00:07:46.250
make everything white just for
now.

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:49.490
This is the vector from Q0 to
Q(t).

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:56.430
This is the point Q(t).
OK, is it kind of visible now?

00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:03.261
OK, thanks for pointing it out.
I will switch to brighter

00:08:03.261 --> 00:08:09.389
colors.
So, OK, so apart from that, 

00:08:09.389 --> 00:08:13.389
I claim now we can find the
position of its moving point

00:08:13.389 --> 00:08:15.663
because,
well, this vector,

00:08:15.663 --> 00:08:19.920
Q0Q1 we can find from the
coordinates of Q0 and Q1.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:26.535
So, we just subtract the
coordinates of Q0 from those of

00:08:26.535 --> 00:08:32.187
Q1 will get that vector Q0 Q1 is
&amp;lt;2,1, -3&amp;gt;

00:08:32.187 --> 00:08:36.132
OK,
so, if I look at it,

00:08:36.132 --> 00:08:44.335
well, so let's call x(t),
y(t), and z(t) the coordinates

00:08:44.335 --> 00:08:50.600
of the point that's moving on
the line.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:09:00.308
Then we get x of t minus,
well, actually plus one equals

00:09:00.308 --> 00:09:07.388
t times two.
I'm writing the components of

00:09:07.388 --> 00:09:13.217
Q0Q(t).
And here, I'm writing t times

00:09:13.217 --> 00:09:19.597
Q0Q1.
y(t) minus two equals t,

00:09:19.597 --> 00:09:28.573
and z(t) minus two equals -3t.
So, in other terms,

00:09:28.573 --> 00:09:34.950
the more familiar way that we
used to write these equations,

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:42.686
let me do it that way instead, 
minus one plus 2t,

00:09:42.686 --> 00:09:53.732
y(t) = 2 t, z(t) = 2 - 3t.
And, if you prefer,

00:09:53.732 --> 00:10:02.470
I can just say Q(t) is Q0 plus
t times vector Q0Q1.

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:07.428
OK, so that's our first
parametric equation of a line in

00:10:07.428 --> 00:10:10.152
this class.
And, I hope you see it's not

00:10:10.152 --> 00:10:13.103
extremely hard.
In fact, parametric equations

00:10:13.103 --> 00:10:17.766
of lines always look like that.
x, y, and z are functions of t

00:10:17.766 --> 00:10:22.220
but are of the form a constant
plus a constant times t.

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:26.809
The coefficients of t tell us
about a vector along the line.

00:10:26.809 --> 00:10:33.590
Here, we have a vector,
Q0Q1, which is &amp;lt;2,1,-3&amp;gt;.

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:37.230
And, the constant terms tell us
about where we are at t=0.

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:41.011
If I plug t=0 these guys go
away, I get minus 1,2,

00:10:41.011 --> 00:10:46.610
2.
That's my starting point.

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:59.730
OK, so, any questions about
that?

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:05.125
No?
OK, so let's see,

00:11:05.125 --> 00:11:12.000
now, what we can do with these
parametric equations.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:26.409
So, one application is to think
about the relative position of a

00:11:26.409 --> 00:11:36.929
line and a plane with respect to
each other.

00:11:36.929 --> 00:11:44.734
So, let's say that we take
still the same line up there,

00:11:44.734 --> 00:11:53.389
and let's consider the plane
with the equation x 2y 4z = 7.

00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:55.279
OK, so I'm giving you this
plane.

00:11:55.279 --> 00:11:58.394
And, the questions that we are
going to ask ourselves are,

00:11:58.394 --> 00:12:00.690
well, does the line intersect
the plane?

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:02.480
And, where does it intersect
the plane?

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:28.202
So, let's start with the first
primary question that maybe we

00:12:28.202 --> 00:12:32.779
should try to understand.
We have these points.

00:12:32.779 --> 00:12:35.883
We have this plane,
and we have these points,

00:12:35.883 --> 00:12:38.367
Q0 and Q1.
I'm going to draw them in

00:12:38.367 --> 00:12:42.396
completely random places.
Well, are Q0 and Q1 on the same

00:12:42.396 --> 00:12:47.049
side of a plane or on different
sides, on opposite sides of the

00:12:47.049 --> 00:12:50.028
planes?
Could it be that maybe one of

00:12:50.028 --> 00:12:59.015
the points is in the plane?
So, I think I'm going to let

00:12:59.015 --> 00:13:05.366
you vote on that.
So, is that readable?

00:13:05.366 --> 00:13:08.274
Is it too small?
OK, so anyway,

00:13:08.274 --> 00:13:12.060
the question says,
relative to the plane,

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:16.497
x 2y 4z = 7.
This point, Q0 and Q1,

00:13:16.497 --> 00:13:22.533
are they on the same side,
on opposite sides,

00:13:22.533 --> 00:13:29.530
is one of them on the plane,
or we can't decide?

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:41.681
OK, that should be better.
So, I see relatively few

00:13:41.681 --> 00:13:46.619
answers.
OK, it looks like also a lot of

00:13:46.619 --> 00:13:51.515
you have forgotten the cards
and, so I see people raising two

00:13:51.515 --> 00:13:55.350
fingers, I see people raising
three fingers.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:57.539
And, I see people raising four
fingers.

00:13:57.539 --> 00:14:01.730
I don't see anyone answering
number one.

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:03.899
So, the general idea seems to
be that either they are on

00:14:03.899 --> 00:14:07.071
opposite sides.
Maybe one of them is on the

00:14:07.071 --> 00:14:10.010
plane.
Well, let's try to see.

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:14.649
Is one of them on the plane?
Well, let's check.

00:14:14.649 --> 00:14:20.108
OK, so let's look at the point,
sorry.

00:14:20.108 --> 00:14:25.419
I have one blackboard to use
here.

00:14:25.419 --> 00:14:31.409
So, I take the point Q0,
which is at (-1,2,2).

00:14:31.409 --> 00:14:37.141
Well, if I plug that into the
plane equation,

00:14:37.141 --> 00:14:44.956
so, x 2y 4z will equal minus
one plus two times two plus four

00:14:44.956 --> 00:14:48.551
times two.
That's, well,

00:14:48.551 --> 00:14:52.502
four plus eight,
12 minus one,

00:14:52.502 --> 00:14:54.307
11.
That, I think,

00:14:54.307 --> 00:15:01.750
is bigger than seven.
OK, so Q0 is not in the plane.

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:07.711
Let's try again with Q1.
(1,3, - 1) well,

00:15:07.711 --> 00:15:15.037
if we plug that into x 2y 4z,
we'll have one plus two times

00:15:15.037 --> 00:15:20.781
three makes seven.
But, we add four times negative

00:15:20.781 --> 00:15:23.461
one.
We add up with three less than

00:15:23.461 --> 00:15:25.272
seven.
Well, that one is not in the

00:15:25.272 --> 00:15:27.793
plane, either.
So, I don't think,

00:15:27.793 --> 00:15:32.860
actually, that the answer
should be number three.

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:37.399
So, let's get rid of answer
number three.

00:15:37.399 --> 00:15:42.657
OK, let's see,
in light of this,

00:15:42.657 --> 00:15:50.120
are you willing to reconsider
your answer?

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:53.649
OK, so I think now everyone
seems to be interested in

00:15:53.649 --> 00:15:57.652
answering number two.
And, I would agree with that

00:15:57.652 --> 00:16:00.399
answer.
So, let's think about it.

00:16:00.399 --> 00:16:02.728
These points are not in the
plane, but they are not in the

00:16:02.728 --> 00:16:05.480
plane in different ways.
One of them somehow overshoots;

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:08.093
we get 11.
The other one we only get 3.

00:16:08.093 --> 00:16:12.045
That's less than seven.
If you think about how a plan

00:16:12.045 --> 00:16:15.960
splits space into two half
spaces on either side,

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:22.240
well, one of them is going to
be the point where x 2y 4z is

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:27.259
less than seven.
And, the other one will be,

00:16:27.259 --> 00:16:32.919
so, that's somehow this side.
And, that's where Q1 is.

00:16:32.919 --> 00:16:43.733
And, the other side is where x
2y 4z is actually bigger than

00:16:43.733 --> 00:16:47.735
seven.
And, to go from one to the

00:16:47.735 --> 00:16:53.389
other, well, x 2y 4z needs to go
through the value seven.

00:16:53.389 --> 00:16:57.491
If you're moving along any path
from Q0 to Q1,

00:16:57.491 --> 00:17:02.139
this thing will change
continuously from 11 to 3.

00:17:02.139 --> 00:17:05.180
At some time,
it has to go through 7.

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:09.505
Does that make sense?
So, to go from Q0 to Q1 we need

00:17:09.505 --> 00:17:12.890
to cross P at some place.
So, they're on opposite sides.

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:37.826
OK, now that doesn't quite
finish answering the question

00:17:37.826 --> 00:17:43.438
that we had, which was,
where does the line intersect

00:17:43.438 --> 00:17:46.464
the plane?
But, why can't we do the same

00:17:46.464 --> 00:17:48.568
thing?
Now, we know not only the

00:17:48.568 --> 00:17:51.706
points Q0 and Q1,
we know actually any point on

00:17:51.706 --> 00:17:55.090
the line because we have a
parametric equation up there

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:57.930
telling us,
where is the point that's

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:04.808
moving on the line at time t?
So, what about the moving

00:18:04.808 --> 00:18:08.442
point, Q(t)?
Well, let's plug its

00:18:08.442 --> 00:18:10.740
coordinates into the plane
equation.

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:24.191
So, we'll take x(t) 2y(t) 4z(t).
OK, that's equal to,

00:18:24.191 --> 00:18:34.240
well, (-1 2t) 2( 2 t) 4( 2 -
3t).

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:41.140
So, if you simplify this a bit,
you get 2t 2t -12t.

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:46.756
That should be -8t.
And, the constant term is minus

00:18:46.756 --> 00:18:54.123
one plus four plus eight is 11.
OK, and we have to compare that

00:18:54.123 --> 00:18:57.414
with seven.
OK, the question is,

00:18:57.414 --> 00:19:07.478
is this ever equal to seven?
Well, so, Q(t) is in the plane

00:19:07.478 --> 00:19:16.180
exactly when -8t 11 equals
seven.

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:20.880
And, that' the same.
If you manipulate this,

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:27.453
you will get t equals one half.
In fact, that's not very

00:19:27.453 --> 00:19:30.030
surprising.
If you look at these values,

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:32.842
11 and three,
you see that seven is actually

00:19:32.842 --> 00:19:35.973
right in between.
It's the average of these two

00:19:35.973 --> 00:19:39.073
numbers.
So, it would make sense that

00:19:39.073 --> 00:19:44.319
it's halfway in between Q0 and
Q1, but we will get seven.

00:19:44.319 --> 00:19:50.332
OK, and that at that time,
Q at time one half,

00:19:50.332 --> 00:19:59.957
well, let's plug the values.
So, minus one plus 2t will be

00:19:59.957 --> 00:20:04.765
zero.
Two plus t will be two and a

00:20:04.765 --> 00:20:11.406
half of five halves,
and two minus three halves will

00:20:11.406 --> 00:20:15.450
be one half, OK?
So, this is where the line

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:16.780
intersects the plane.

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:47.066
So, you see that's actually a
pretty easy way of finding where

00:20:47.066 --> 00:20:49.299
a line on the plane intersects
each other.

00:20:49.299 --> 00:20:52.787
If we can find a parametric
equation of a line and an

00:20:52.787 --> 00:20:55.727
equation of a plane,
but we basically just plug one

00:20:55.727 --> 00:20:59.674
into the other,
and see at what time the moving

00:20:59.674 --> 00:21:04.660
point hits the plane so that we
know where this.

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:23.410
OK, other questions about this?
Yes?

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:30.599
Sorry, can you say that?
Yes, so what if we don't get a

00:21:30.599 --> 00:21:32.440
solution?
What happens?

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:36.377
So, indeed our line could have
been parallel to the plane or

00:21:36.377 --> 00:21:38.779
maybe even contained in the
plane.

00:21:38.779 --> 00:21:42.408
Well, if the line is parallel
to the plane then maybe what

00:21:42.408 --> 00:21:46.099
happens is that what we plug in
the positions of the moving

00:21:46.099 --> 00:21:48.164
point,
we actually get something that

00:21:48.164 --> 00:21:50.940
never equals seven because maybe
we get actually a constant.

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:53.533
Say that we had gotten,
I don't know,

00:21:53.533 --> 00:21:56.720
13 all the time.
Well, when is 13 equal to seven?

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:59.983
The answer is never.
OK, so that's what would tell

00:21:59.983 --> 00:22:02.109
you that the line is actually
parallel to the plane.

00:22:02.109 --> 00:22:06.258
You would not find a solution
to the equation that you get at

00:22:06.258 --> 00:22:13.450
the end.
Yes?

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:16.295
So, if there's no solution at
all to the equation that you

00:22:16.295 --> 00:22:19.441
get, it means that at no time is
the traveling point going to be

00:22:19.441 --> 00:22:22.055
in the plane.
That means the line really does

00:22:22.055 --> 00:22:25.136
not have the plane ever.
So, it has to be parallel

00:22:25.136 --> 00:22:27.186
outside of it.
On the other hand,

00:22:27.186 --> 00:22:30.709
if a line is inside the plane,
then that means that no matter

00:22:30.709 --> 00:22:33.410
what time you choose,
you always get seven.

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:37.225
OK, that's what would happen if
a line is in the plane.

00:22:37.225 --> 00:22:44.094
You always get seven.
So, maybe I should write this

00:22:44.094 --> 00:22:54.460
down.
So, if a line is in the plane

00:22:54.460 --> 00:23:10.780
then plugging x(t),
y(t), z(t) into the equation,

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:18.852
we always get, 
well, here in this case seven

00:23:18.852 --> 00:23:22.400
or whatever the value should be
for the plane,

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:34.521
If the line is parallel to the
plane -- -- in fact,

00:23:34.521 --> 00:23:45.430
we, well, get,
let's see, another constant.

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:49.152
So, in fact,
you know, when you plug in

00:23:49.152 --> 00:23:51.952
these things,
normally you get a quantity

00:23:51.952 --> 00:23:54.262
that's of a form,
something times t plus a

00:23:54.262 --> 00:23:57.809
constant because that's what you
plug into the equation of a

00:23:57.809 --> 00:23:59.261
plane.
And so, in general,

00:23:59.261 --> 00:24:01.900
you have an equation of the
form, something times t plus

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:05.694
something equals something.
And, that usually has a single

00:24:05.694 --> 00:24:08.249
solution.
And, the special case is if

00:24:08.249 --> 00:24:11.920
this coefficient of t turns out
to be zero in the end,

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.119
and that's actually going to
happen,

00:24:14.119 --> 00:24:20.450
exactly when the line is either
parallel or in the plane.

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:24.039
In fact, if you think this
through carefully,

00:24:24.039 --> 00:24:26.289
the coefficient of t that you
get here,

00:24:26.289 --> 00:24:30.536
see, it's one times two plus
two times one plus four times

00:24:30.536 --> 00:24:33.578
minus three.
It's the dot product between

00:24:33.578 --> 00:24:37.859
the normal vector of a plane and
the vector along the line.

00:24:37.859 --> 00:24:41.558
So, see, this coefficient
becomes zero exactly when the

00:24:41.558 --> 00:24:44.640
line is perpendicular to the
normal vector.

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:46.440
That means it's parallel to the
plane.

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:51.461
So, everything makes sense.
OK, if you're confused about

00:24:51.461 --> 00:24:55.070
what I just said,
you can ignore it.

00:24:55.070 --> 00:25:03.125
OK, more questions? No?
OK, so if not,

00:25:03.125 --> 00:25:09.089
let's move on to linear
parametric equations.

00:25:09.089 --> 00:25:13.921
So, I hope you've seen here
that parametric equations are a

00:25:13.921 --> 00:25:18.646
great way to think about lines.
There are also a great way to

00:25:18.646 --> 00:25:22.531
think about actually any curve,
any trajectory that can be

00:25:22.531 --> 00:25:34.650
traced by a moving point.
So -- -- more generally,

00:25:34.650 --> 00:26:00.601
we can use parametric equations
-- -- for arbitrary motions --

00:26:00.601 --> 00:26:15.930
-- in the plane or in space.
So, let's look at an example.

00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:20.221
Let's take, so,
it's a famous curve called a

00:26:20.221 --> 00:26:23.485
cycloid.
A cycloid is something that you

00:26:23.485 --> 00:26:27.870
can actually see sometimes at
night when people are biking If

00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:31.890
you have something that reflects
light on the wheel.

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:33.930
So, let me explain what's the
definition of a cycloid.

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:07.950
So, I should say,
I've seen a lecture where,

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:10.508
actually, the professor had a
volunteer on a unicycle to

00:27:10.508 --> 00:27:13.904
demonstrate how that works.
But, I didn't arrange for that,

00:27:13.904 --> 00:27:17.562
so instead I will explain it to
you using more conventional

00:27:17.562 --> 00:27:23.354
means.
So, let's say that we have a

00:27:23.354 --> 00:27:31.750
wheel that's rolling on a
horizontal ground.

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:34.740
And, as it's rolling of course
it's going to turn.

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:40.990
So, it's going to move forward
to a new position.

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:45.210
And, now, let's mention that we
have a point that's been painted

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:47.890
red on the circumference of the
wheel.

00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:51.130
And, initially,
that point is here.

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:53.586
So, as the wheel stops
rotating, well,

00:27:53.586 --> 00:27:57.369
of course, it moves forward,
and so it turns on itself.

00:27:57.369 --> 00:28:02.584
So, that point starts falling
back behind the point of contact

00:28:02.584 --> 00:28:07.714
because the wheel is rotating at
the same time as it's moving

00:28:07.714 --> 00:28:12.124
forward.
And so, the cycloid is the

00:28:12.124 --> 00:28:21.509
trajectory of this moving point.
OK, so the cycloid is obtained

00:28:21.509 --> 00:28:27.278
by considering,
so we have a wheel,

00:28:27.278 --> 00:28:38.025
let's say, of radius a.
So, this height here is (a)

00:28:38.025 --> 00:28:47.880
rolling on the floor which is
the x axis.

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:53.822
And, let's -- And,
we have a point,

00:28:53.822 --> 00:29:01.640
P, that's painted on the wheel.
Initially, it's at the origin.

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.621
But, of course,
as time goes by,

00:29:04.621 --> 00:29:13.730
it moves on the wheel.
P is a point on the rim of the

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:21.890
wheel, and it starts at the
origin.

00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:27.829
So, the question is,
what happens?

00:29:27.829 --> 00:29:32.206
In particular,
can we find the position of

00:29:32.206 --> 00:29:37.329
this point, x(t),
y(t), as a function of time?

00:29:37.329 --> 00:29:42.619
So, that's the reason why I
have this computer.

00:29:42.619 --> 00:29:48.733
So, I'm not sure it will be
very easy to visualize,

00:29:48.733 --> 00:29:54.969
but so we have a wheel,
well, I hope you can vaguely

00:29:54.969 --> 00:30:00.350
see that there's a circle that's
moving.

00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:05.419
The wheel is green here.
And, there's a radius that's

00:30:05.419 --> 00:30:09.678
been painted blue in it.
And, that radius rotates around

00:30:09.678 --> 00:30:12.859
the wheel as the wheel is moving
forward.

00:30:12.859 --> 00:30:23.839
So, now, let's try to paint,
actually, the trajectory of a

00:30:23.839 --> 00:30:26.425
point.
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:26.425 --> 00:30:30.920
OK, so that's what the cycloid
looks like.

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:37.056
[APPLAUSE]
OK, so -- So the cycloid,

00:30:37.056 --> 00:30:47.400
well, I guess it doesn't quite
look like what I've drawn.

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:52.311
It looks like it goes a bit
higher up, which will be the

00:30:52.311 --> 00:30:57.718
trajectory of this red point.
And, see, it hits the bottom

00:30:57.718 --> 00:31:01.500
once in a while.
It forms these arches because

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:04.809
when the wheel has rotated by a
full turn,

00:31:04.809 --> 00:31:07.099
then you're basically back at
the same situation,

00:31:07.099 --> 00:31:09.890
except a bit further along the
route.

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:13.491
So, if we do it once more,
you see the point now is at the

00:31:13.491 --> 00:31:18.303
top, and now it's at the bottom.
And then we start again.

00:31:18.303 --> 00:31:23.520
It's at the top,
and then again at the bottom.

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:40.390
OK.
No.

00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:48.818
[LAUGHTER]
OK, so the question that we

00:31:48.818 --> 00:31:58.614
want to answer is what is the
position x(t),

00:31:58.614 --> 00:32:05.645
y(t), of the point P?
OK, so actually,

00:32:05.645 --> 00:32:07.650
I'm writing x(t),
y(t).

00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:10.094
That means that I have,
maybe I'm expressing the

00:32:10.094 --> 00:32:13.374
position in terms of time.
Let's see, is time going to be

00:32:13.374 --> 00:32:15.576
a good thing to do?
Well, suddenly,

00:32:15.576 --> 00:32:20.053
the position changes over time.
But doesn't actually matter how

00:32:20.053 --> 00:32:24.528
fast the wheel is rolling?
No, because I can just play the

00:32:24.528 --> 00:32:27.772
motion fast-forward.
The wheel will be going faster,

00:32:27.772 --> 00:32:29.750
but the trajectory is still the
same.

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:32.559
So, in fact,
time is not the most relevant

00:32:32.559 --> 00:32:36.010
thing here.
What matters to us now is how

00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:39.905
far the wheel has gone.
So, we could use as a

00:32:39.905 --> 00:32:44.470
parameter, for example,
the distance by which the wheel

00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:46.878
has moved.
We can do even better because

00:32:46.878 --> 00:32:49.180
we see that, really,
the most complicated thing that

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:50.940
happens here is really the
rotation.

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:55.210
So, maybe we can actually use
the angle by which the wheel has

00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:57.730
turned to parameterize the
motion.

00:32:57.730 --> 00:33:02.194
So, there's various choices.
You can choose whichever one

00:33:02.194 --> 00:33:04.135
you prefer.
But, I think here,

00:33:04.135 --> 00:33:07.517
we will get the simplest answer
if we parameterize things by the

00:33:07.517 --> 00:33:10.978
angle.
So, in fact,

00:33:10.978 --> 00:33:23.884
instead of t I will be using
what's called theta as a

00:33:23.884 --> 00:33:36.543
function of the angle,
theta, by which the wheel has

00:33:36.543 --> 00:33:50.990
rotated.
So, how are we going to do that?

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:57.541
Well, because we are going to
try to use our new knowledge,

00:33:57.541 --> 00:34:03.190
let's try to do it using
vectors in a smart way.

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:07.712
So, let me draw a picture of
the wheel after things have

00:34:07.712 --> 00:34:12.665
rotated by a certain amount.
So, maybe my point,

00:34:12.665 --> 00:34:18.180
P, now, is here.
And, so the wheel has rotated

00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:21.887
by this angle here.
And, I want to find the

00:34:21.887 --> 00:34:23.699
position of my point,
P, OK?

00:34:23.699 --> 00:34:29.546
So, the position of this point,
P, is going to be the same as

00:34:29.546 --> 00:34:35.489
knowing the vector OP from the
origin to this moving point.

00:34:35.489 --> 00:34:39.398
So, I haven't really simplify
the problem yet because we don't

00:34:39.398 --> 00:34:43.754
really know about vector OP.
But, maybe we know about

00:34:43.754 --> 00:34:47.710
simpler vectors where some will
be OP.

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:50.375
So, let's see,
let's give names to a few of

00:34:50.375 --> 00:34:52.093
our points.
For example,

00:34:52.093 --> 00:34:54.849
let's say that this will be
point A.

00:34:54.849 --> 00:34:58.179
A is the point where the wheel
is touching the road.

00:34:58.179 --> 00:35:02.820
And, B will be the center of
the wheel.

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:07.083
Then, it looks like maybe I
have actually a chance of

00:35:07.083 --> 00:35:12.248
understanding vectors like maybe
OA doesn't look quite so scary,

00:35:12.248 --> 00:35:16.690
or AB doesn't look too bad.
BP doesn't look too bad.

00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:27.010
And, if I sum them together,
I will obtain OP.

00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:35.530
So, let's do that.
So, now we've greatly

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:39.218
simplified the problem.
We had to find one vector that

00:35:39.218 --> 00:35:42.667
we didn't know.
Now we have to find three

00:35:42.667 --> 00:35:47.233
vectors which we don't know.
But, you will see each of them

00:35:47.233 --> 00:35:50.710
as fairly easy to think about.
So, let's see.

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:56.750
Should we start with vector OA,
maybe?

00:35:56.750 --> 00:36:04.079
So, OA has two components.
One of them should be very easy.

00:36:04.079 --> 00:36:06.596
Well, the y component is just
going to be zero,

00:36:06.596 --> 00:36:10.510
OK?
It's directed along the x axis.

00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:15.506
What about the x component?
So, OA is the distance by which

00:36:15.506 --> 00:36:21.090
the wheel has traveled to get to
its current position.

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:23.536
Yeah.
I hear a lot of people saying R

00:36:23.536 --> 00:36:25.812
theta.
Let me actually say a(theta)

00:36:25.812 --> 00:36:28.720
because I've called a the radius
of the wheel.

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:33.769
So, this distance is a(theta).
Why is it a(theta)?

00:36:33.769 --> 00:36:36.366
Well, that's because the wheel,
well, there's an assumption

00:36:36.366 --> 00:36:38.962
which is that the wheel is
rolling on something normal like

00:36:38.962 --> 00:36:40.932
a road,
and not on, maybe,

00:36:40.932 --> 00:36:45.218
ice, or something like that.
S So, it's rolling without

00:36:45.218 --> 00:36:48.079
slipping.
So, that means that this

00:36:48.079 --> 00:36:53.415
distance on the road is actually
equal to the distance here on

00:36:53.415 --> 00:36:57.290
the circumference of the wheel.
This point, P,

00:36:57.290 --> 00:37:01.087
was there, and the amount by
which the things have moved can

00:37:01.087 --> 00:37:06.390
be measured either here or here.
These are the same distances.

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:15.422
OK, so, that makes it a(theta), 
and maybe I should justify by

00:37:15.422 --> 00:37:22.010
saying amount by which the wheel
has rolled,

00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:30.674
has moved, is equal to the, 
so, the distance from O to A is

00:37:30.674 --> 00:37:37.464
equal to the arc length on the
circumference of the circle from

00:37:37.464 --> 00:37:40.116
A to P.
And, you know that if you have

00:37:40.116 --> 00:37:42.400
a sector corresponding to an
angle, theta,

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:45.654
then its length is a times
theta, provided that,

00:37:45.654 --> 00:37:48.840
of course, you express the
angel in radians.

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:58.369
That's the reason why we always
used radians in math.

00:37:58.369 --> 00:38:01.820
Now, let's think about vector
AB and vector BP.

00:38:30.889 --> 00:38:39.677
OK, so AB is pretty easy,
right, because it's pointing

00:38:39.677 --> 00:38:45.480
straight up, and its length is
a.

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:55.630
So, it's just zero, a.
Now, the most serious one we've

00:38:55.630 --> 00:39:00.090
kept for the end.
What about vector BP?

00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:04.429
So, vector BP,
we know two things about it.

00:39:04.429 --> 00:39:17.138
We know actually its length,
so, the magnitude of BP -- --

00:39:17.138 --> 00:39:23.077
a.
And, we know it makes an angle,

00:39:23.077 --> 00:39:29.285
theta, with the vertical.
So, that should let us find its

00:39:29.285 --> 00:39:34.750
components.
Let's draw a closer picture.

00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:40.780
Now, in the picture I'm going
to center things at B.

00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:44.909
So, I have my point P.
Here I have theta.

00:39:44.909 --> 00:39:49.805
This length is A.
Well, what are the components

00:39:49.805 --> 00:39:57.343
of BP?
Well, the X component is going

00:39:57.343 --> 00:39:59.358
to be?
Almost.

00:39:59.358 --> 00:40:03.010
I hear people saying things
about a, but I agree with a.

00:40:03.010 --> 00:40:04.760
I hear some cosines.
I hear some sines.

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:07.576
I think it's actually the sine.
Yes.

00:40:07.576 --> 00:40:10.590
It's a(sin(theta)),
except it's going to the left.

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:18.690
So, actually it will have a
negative a(sin(theta)).

00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:23.420
And, the vertical component,
well, it will be a(cos(theta)),

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:27.510
but also negative because we
are going downwards.

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:46.355
So, it's negative a(cos(theta)).
So, now we can answer the

00:40:46.355 --> 00:40:52.881
initial question because vector
OP, well, we just add up OA,

00:40:52.881 --> 00:40:57.175
AB, and BP.
So, the X component will be

00:40:57.175 --> 00:41:09.150
a(theta) - a(sin(theta)).
And, a-a(cos(theta)).

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:25.220
OK.
So, any questions about that?

00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:29.737
OK, so, what's the answer?
Because this thing here is the

00:41:29.737 --> 00:41:35.584
x coordinate as a function of
theta, and that one is the y

00:41:35.584 --> 00:41:39.380
coordinate as a function of
theta.

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:44.026
So, now, just to show you that
we can do a lot of things when

00:41:44.026 --> 00:41:48.440
we have a parametric equation,
here is a small mystery.

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:54.630
So, what happens exactly near
the bottom point?

00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:57.265
What does the curve look like?
The computer tells us,

00:41:57.265 --> 00:41:59.974
well, it looks like it has some
sort of pointy thing,

00:41:59.974 --> 00:42:02.110
but isn't that something of a
display?

00:42:02.110 --> 00:42:12.056
Is it actually what happens?
So, what do you think happens

00:42:12.056 --> 00:42:19.630
near the bottom point?
Remember, we had that picture.

00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:24.616
Let me show you once more,
where you have these

00:42:24.616 --> 00:42:28.409
corner-like things at the
bottom.

00:42:28.409 --> 00:42:31.584
Well, actually,
is it indeed a corner with some

00:42:31.584 --> 00:42:34.000
angle between the two
directions?

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.045
Does it make an angle?
Or, is it actually a smooth

00:42:38.045 --> 00:42:42.003
curve without any corner,
but we don't see it because

00:42:42.003 --> 00:42:46.190
it's too small to be visible on
the computer screen?

00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:50.884
Does it actually make a loop?
Does it actually come down and

00:42:50.884 --> 00:42:55.434
then back up without going to
the left or to the right and

00:42:55.434 --> 00:43:01.039
without making an angle?
So, yeah, I see the majority

00:43:01.039 --> 00:43:05.719
votes for answers number two or
four.

00:43:05.719 --> 00:43:08.510
And, well, at this point,
we can't quite tell.

00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:10.760
So, let's try to figure it out
from these formulas.

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:17.105
The way to answer that for sure
is to actually look at the

00:43:17.105 --> 00:43:23.252
formulas.
OK, so question that we are

00:43:23.252 --> 00:43:34.190
trying to answer now is what
happens near the bottom point?

00:43:52.850 --> 00:43:58.724
OK, so how do we answer that?
Well, we should probably try to

00:43:58.724 --> 00:44:03.219
find simpler formulas for these
things.

00:44:03.219 --> 00:44:06.620
Well, to simplify,
let's divide everything by a.

00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:08.746
Let's rescale everything by a.
If you want,

00:44:08.746 --> 00:44:12.127
let's say that we take the unit
of length to be the radius of

00:44:12.127 --> 00:44:15.205
our wheel.
So, instead of measuring things

00:44:15.205 --> 00:44:18.533
in feet or meters,
we'll just measure them in

00:44:18.533 --> 00:44:25.242
radius.
So, take the length unit to be

00:44:25.242 --> 00:44:32.210
equal to the radius.
So, that means we'll have a=1.

00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:35.150
Then, our formulas are slightly
simpler.

00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:45.845
We get x(theta) is theta -
sin(theta), and y equals 1 - cos

00:44:45.845 --> 00:44:49.069
(theta).
OK, so, if we want to

00:44:49.069 --> 00:44:52.879
understand what these things
look like, maybe we should try

00:44:52.879 --> 00:44:56.184
to take some approximation.
OK, so what about

00:44:56.184 --> 00:45:00.866
approximations?
Well, probably you know that if

00:45:00.866 --> 00:45:07.719
I take the sine of a very small
angle, it's close to the actual

00:45:07.719 --> 00:45:12.030
angle itself if theta is very
small.

00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:18.515
And, you know that the cosine
of an angle that's very small is

00:45:18.515 --> 00:45:21.199
close to one.
Well, that's pretty good.

00:45:21.199 --> 00:45:23.985
If we use that,
we will get theta minus theta,

00:45:23.985 --> 00:45:26.709
one minus one,
it looks like it's not precise

00:45:26.709 --> 00:45:29.039
enough.
We just get zero and zero.

00:45:29.039 --> 00:45:31.679
That's not telling us much
about what happens.

00:45:31.679 --> 00:45:39.170
OK, so we need actually better
approximations than that.

00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:50.306
So -- So, hopefully you have
seen in one variable calculus

00:45:50.306 --> 00:45:57.340
something called Taylor
expansion.

00:45:57.340 --> 00:46:14.639
That's [GROANS].
I see that -- OK, 

00:46:14.639 --> 00:46:17.039
so if you have not seen Taylor
expansion,

00:46:17.039 --> 00:46:21.767
or somehow it was so traumatic
that you've blocked it out of

00:46:21.767 --> 00:46:24.460
your memory,
let me just remind you that

00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:27.994
Taylor expansion is a way to get
a better approximation than just

00:46:27.994 --> 00:46:32.039
looking at the function,
its derivative.

00:46:32.039 --> 00:46:42.741
So -- And, here's an example of
where it actually comes in handy

00:46:42.741 --> 00:46:52.812
in real life.
So, Taylor approximation says

00:46:52.812 --> 00:47:01.445
that if t is small,
then the value of the function,

00:47:01.445 --> 00:47:04.940
f(t), is approximately equal
to,

00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:07.930
well, our first guess,
of course, would be f(0).

00:47:07.930 --> 00:47:12.615
That's our first approximation.
If we want to be a bit more

00:47:12.615 --> 00:47:15.019
precise, we know that when we
change by t,

00:47:15.019 --> 00:47:17.969
well, t times the derivative
comes in,

00:47:17.969 --> 00:47:23.849
that's for linear approximation
to how the function changes.

00:47:23.849 --> 00:47:28.406
Now, if we want to be even more
precise, there's another term,

00:47:28.406 --> 00:47:32.289
which is t^2 over two times the
second derivative.

00:47:32.289 --> 00:47:37.587
And, if we want to be even more
precise, you will have t^3 over

00:47:37.587 --> 00:47:41.090
six times the third derivative
at zero.

00:47:41.090 --> 00:47:43.880
OK, and you can continue,
and so on.

00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:49.042
But, we won't need more.
So, if you use this here,

00:47:49.042 --> 00:47:53.313
it tells you that the sine of a
smaller angle,

00:47:53.313 --> 00:47:57.300
theta, well,
yeah, it looks like theta.

00:47:57.300 --> 00:48:01.520
But, if we want to be more
precise, then we should add

00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:06.417
minus theta cubed over six.
And, cosine of theta,

00:48:06.417 --> 00:48:12.544
well, it's not quite one.
It's close to one minus theta

00:48:12.544 --> 00:48:16.470
squared over two.
OK, so these are slightly

00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:21.449
better approximations of sine
and cosine for small angles.

00:48:21.449 --> 00:48:28.395
So, now, if we try to figure
out, again, what happens to our

00:48:28.395 --> 00:48:31.809
x of theta, well,
it would be,

00:48:31.809 --> 00:48:36.990
sorry, theta minus theta cubed
over six.

00:48:36.990 --> 00:48:44.695
That's theta cubed over six.
And y, on the other hand,

00:48:44.695 --> 00:48:53.338
is going to be one minus that.
That's about theta squared over

00:48:53.338 --> 00:48:57.049
two.
So, now, which one of them is

00:48:57.049 --> 00:49:01.340
bigger when theta is small?
Yeah, y is much larger.

00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:03.990
OK, if you take the cube of a
very small number,

00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:06.019
it becomes very,
very, very small.

00:49:06.019 --> 00:49:09.920
So, in fact,
we can look at that.

00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:15.659
So, x, an absolute value,
is much smaller than y.

00:49:15.659 --> 00:49:17.834
And, in fact,
what we can do is we can look

00:49:17.834 --> 00:49:21.800
at the ratio between y and x.
That tells us the slope with

00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:27.451
which we approach the origin.
So, y over x is,

00:49:27.451 --> 00:49:35.449
well, let's take the ratio of
this, too.

00:49:35.449 --> 00:49:38.900
That gives us three divided by
theta.

00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:45.530
That tends to infinity when
theta approaches zero.

00:49:45.530 --> 00:49:53.731
So, that means that the slope
of our curve,

00:49:53.731 --> 00:50:00.369
the origin is actually
infinite.

00:50:00.369 --> 00:50:05.090
And so, the curve picture is
really something like this.

00:50:05.090 --> 00:50:07.773
So, the instantaneous motion,
if you had to describe what

00:50:07.773 --> 00:50:09.922
happens very,
very close to the origin is

00:50:09.922 --> 00:50:12.943
that your point is actually not
moving to the left or to the

00:50:12.943 --> 00:50:17.670
right along with the wheel.
It's moving down and up.

00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:20.665
I mean, at the same time it is
actually moving a little bit

00:50:20.665 --> 00:50:24.242
forward at the same time.
But, the dominant motion,

00:50:24.242 --> 00:50:29.130
near the origin is really where
it goes down and back up,

00:50:29.130 --> 00:50:33.670
so answer number four,
you have vertical tangent.

00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:37.970
OK, I think I'm at the end of
time.

00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:44.000
So, have a nice weekend.
And, I'll see you on Tuesday.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.902
So, on Tuesday I will have
practice exams for next week's

00:50:47.902 --> 00:50:50.000
test.
