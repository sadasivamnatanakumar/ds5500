CASEY RODRIGUEZ: So
last time we finished

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.310
by proving Bolzano's
intermediate value

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:34.690
theorem, which states that a
continuous function achieves

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.020
all values in between
the function evaluated

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.840
at the endpoint.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:55.625
So if I have a continuous
function, neither--

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.790
I take a value y between f of
a and f of b, so either f of a

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.370
is less than f of b
and y's in between

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.780
is bigger than f of a and
less than f of b, or f of a

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.510
is bigger than f of b, but
y is still in between them.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:30.770
Then there exists c in the
interval a, b so that f of c

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:31.670
equals y.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.800
So every value in between f
evaluated at the endpoints

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.150
is achieved.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.800
I drew the picture
that went along

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:55.425
with this a, b, f of a, f
of b, and that could be--

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.120
and if we take
anything in between,

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:13.322
then there has to be some
c so that f of c equals y.

00:02:13.322 --> 00:02:14.780
At least in the
picture, I've drawn

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.780
there's three different
guys, but there's always

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.750
at least one.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.800
And then the last
thing we talked

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.360
about at the end
of last lecture was

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:32.390
that the image of a closed
and bounded interval

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.650
by a continuous function is,
again, a closed and bounded

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:51.190
interval, where e corresponds
to the absolute max of f,

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.680
and f corresponds so that--

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.180
I shouldn't call this f since
we already have f being used--

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.200
let's make it d--

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.690
corresponds to the
absolute min of f.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:29.050
So it's what we proved last
time is that if f is continuous,

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:37.800
then there exists
e, d and r, such

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.060
that the range of this
closed and bounded interval

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.080
is, again, a closed
and bounded interval.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.330
So f is very well-behaved on
closed and bounded intervals.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.072
And we'll see another way in
which continuous functions are

00:03:54.072 --> 00:03:56.280
well behaved on a closed
and bounded interval in just

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.780
a second.

00:04:00.184 --> 00:04:08.820
Now, a simple application of
the Bolzano intermediate value

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.680
theorem is the following--

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.420
really is an application
of that theorem

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.019
that I labeled the
bisection method.

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.540
But let's chalk that up to
the Bolzano intermediate value

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:29.220
theorem, which is the
following that if f of x

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:49.520
is any odd polynomial, then
f has at least one real root.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.750
So any odd polynomial has
at least one real root.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.670
So by the fundamental
theorem of algebra,

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:06.740
every polynomial has exactly
n roots, n corresponding

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.230
to the degree of the
polynomial, but these roots

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.650
can be complex valued.

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.800
But for odd polynomials, there
must be at least one real root,

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.870
and this is a consequence of
the Bolzano intermediate value

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:19.370
theorem.

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.580
But instead of proving this
theorem in its full generality,

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.860
let me just give you a
representative example.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:43.800
So let's take f of x
equals x to the 2021 minus

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.750
x to the 2020 plus--

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:49.620
I don't know.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:50.970
What's today?

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.128
I think the 25 or 24.

00:05:53.128 --> 00:05:53.670
I don't know.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:06:04.830
--1025x minus 300.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:05.715
So what's the point?

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:16.530
As long as I plug
in a big enough x,

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.000
this will swamp everything here.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:32.490
So, for example, if I
stick in f of 100,000,

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.850
I leave it to you to check
that this is positive

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:40.260
because this will be 100,000
to the 2020 minus 100,000

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:46.320
to the 2021, and
then plus this, which

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.940
will be positive minus 300.

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:48.880
This doesn't matter.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:55.440
So what really matters is this
guy with the largest power

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.830
will swamp all the other
ones and eventually

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:02.130
be positive if I stick in a
large enough positive value.

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:16.750
In fact, for this guy, if I
stick in a negative value,

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.260
then I get something
very big, but now

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.940
with a minus sign,
which will again

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.770
swamp all these earlier guys.

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.200
In fact, I don't have
to choose minus 100,000.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.992
If I just stick in 0,
I will get minus 300,

00:07:27.992 --> 00:07:28.950
which will be negative.

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:33.930
But you can check that if
I stick in minus 100,000,

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:35.100
this will still be negative.

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:41.810
Thus, by the intermediate
value theorem,

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:59.380
there exists a c in
100,000 so that f of c

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:03.880
equals 0 because 0 is something
in between f evaluated

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.230
at these two endpoints.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.500
And the idea is the same is that
as long as you go far enough

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:21.700
out and positive, then the
polynomial will be positive

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.580
if the coefficient out
in front is positive;

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.970
and if you go far
enough out negative,

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:33.380
then you'll get something
that's negative.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.480
And then you apply the
intermediate value theorem

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.360
to be able to find a root.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.690
Now, of course,
one other thing we

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:49.525
did with the statement of
the min-max theorem was,

00:08:49.525 --> 00:08:59.790
can we drop any of the
assumptions on this theorem?

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:03.910
And you can see that
the example is no.

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:12.410
So the question is, if f from
a closed and bounded interval

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:24.750
is not continuous and, let's
say, f of 0 is less than 0,

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:33.870
f of a, f of b is
bigger than 0, then

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:42.495
does there exist c, a, b,
such that f of c equals 0?

00:09:45.862 --> 00:09:47.570
Let me put that question
mark at the end.

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:56.680
And it's easy to come up with
an example of a function that

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.560
is not continuous that
satisfies these conclusions,

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.830
and there does not exist a
point in between so that f of c

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:03.790
equals 0.

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:07.190
Simplest being, I'll
just draw a picture.

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:17.370
Let's go from minus 1, 2.

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:32.390
So then the function is
f of x equals x minus 1.

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:41.200
And this is for x not equal
to 1, and let's make it a 1/2

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:41.700
there.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:55.000
So this function
looks like 1/2 there.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.195
So there is no value,
there is no c in between.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:07.720
So x is between 0 and 2.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:11.860
So you see f of 0 is equal
to minus 1, that's negative;

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:14.200
f of 2 is equal to
1, it's positive;

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:19.180
but there exists no c in
between, so that f of c

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:21.970
equals 0.

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:24.460
So what's the point I'm making?

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:29.140
We really do need
this hypothesis

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:34.120
that the function is continuous
for this theorem to be true.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.610
If you drop that
hypothesis, then the theorem

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:37.600
is no longer true.

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:11.610
So now we're going to move
on to a new concept called

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:15.330
uniform continuity.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:20.760
And before I do this,
I'm going to rewrite

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.350
the definition of continuity.

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:51.920
So this is an old
definition, but I

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:55.320
want to highlight a
specific aspect of it.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.010
So this is me writing
the definition

00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:59.495
of a continuous function again.

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:17.400
So function f from a set
s to r is continuous.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:21.200
So we said that means it's
continuous at every point,

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:28.850
meaning if for all c And
s, it's continuous at c,

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:33.215
which means for all epsilon
positive, there exists a delta.

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:44.210
And we saw this in examples
that we did proving continuity.

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:51.980
This usually depends on
epsilon and c, the point where

00:13:51.980 --> 00:14:00.520
I'm looking at, such
that for all x and s,

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:03.620
x minus c less
than delta implies

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:09.170
that f of x minus f of
c is less than epsilon.

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:18.770
So this is, again,
a bit of review.

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:21.400
But I just want to show
you that, in general,

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:26.510
when we verify that a function
is continuous on a set,

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:29.060
we have to show it's continuous
at every point in the set.

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:31.520
And that means for every
epsilon, there exist delta.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.880
But this delta usually
depends on epsilon,

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:37.520
but it can also depend on
the point c, which is where

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.700
we're checking continuity at.

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:45.890
So for simple
example, let's take

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:54.920
f of x equals 1 over x on
the open interval 0, 1.

00:14:54.920 --> 00:15:07.680
So I claim f of x equals
1 over x is continuous.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:12.590
So proof we have to show
that for every c and 0, 1

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:14.520
for all epsilon,
there exists that.

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:25.190
So let's see b and 0, 1,
but epsilon be positive.

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:34.770
Again, since this
kind of review,

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:37.820
I'm not going to go through the
process of really the thinking

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.610
behind choosing this delta.

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:43.310
I mean, there's calculations
you do off to the side

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:44.810
to try and get this delta.

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:52.710
But let's choose delta to
be the minimum of c over 2

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:58.690
and c squared over
2 times epsilon.

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:02.160
So what I want to
again emphasize

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.890
is this delta depends on c,
the point we're looking at,

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:06.660
and epsilon.

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:11.430
So I claim this delta works.

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:21.495
Suppose x is in 0, 1, and x
minus c is less than delta.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:39.920
Then absolute value of x, this
is by the triangle inequality.

00:16:42.898 --> 00:16:43.940
Let me write it this way.

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:54.620
c absolute value is
equal to c minus x

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:57.800
plus x, which is less
than or equal to c

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:06.710
minus x plus x, which is less
than delta, which is less than

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:08.450
or equal to the
minimum of these two.

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:15.400
So it's certainly less than
or equal to c over 2 plus x.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:24.520
And now c and x, these are in
0, 1, so they're all positive,

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.170
and therefore I get that--

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.570
Let's go to the next board.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:43.300
So if I subtract the c over
2 over to the other side,

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:49.170
I get that c over
2 is less than x.

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:52.740
So this is as long as
x is in 0 and x minus c

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.380
is less than delta.

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:58.230
This should not be a shock.

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:05.520
There's 0, 1, c, c
over 2 3c over 2.

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:12.890
And so if x is in this
interval, it certainly

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:15.170
bounded away by c over 2.

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:21.930
Or if x is in here, then x is
certainly bigger than c over 2.

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:31.280
And now we look at
f of x minus f of c.

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:34.220
This is equal to
1 over x minus 1

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:43.360
over c equals c minus x
over x times c, which is

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:46.315
less than delta over x times c.

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:04.340
And now x is bigger than c over
2, so if I take 1 over that,

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:08.120
I get 1 over x is
less than 2 over c.

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:12.990
So this is less than or equal
to 2 delta over c squared,

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:15.770
and delta is the
minimum of now c over 2

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:18.600
and c squared over
2 times epsilon.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:20.340
So this is less
than or equal to 2

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:26.843
over c squared times c squared
over 2 epsilon equals epsilon.

00:19:26.843 --> 00:19:28.760
So I just went through
the proof of continuity

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:34.800
for 1 over x, which using better
machinery we could have proven.

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:41.150
But I did this to
highlight this point that's

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:48.490
showing continuity
of 1 over x on 0, 1,

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:52.990
that in showing that, this
delta that you are choosing

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:55.800
depends on the point
you're looking at.

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:10.380
So what the definition of
continuity says is for all c,

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:13.800
for all epsilon,
you can find a delta

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.990
depending on epsilon and c.

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:22.380
Now, uniform continuity
removes that necessity of delta

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.300
depending on c.

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:28.370
And I'm going to make a possibly
bad analogy in just a minute,

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:30.120
but first let me write
down the definition

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.500
of uniform continuity.

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:43.050
Let s be subset of r,
f going from s to r.

00:20:47.810 --> 00:21:04.180
We say f is uniformly
continuous on s

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:10.980
if for all epsilon positive,
there exists a delta depending

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:19.520
only on epsilon, such
that where all x, c and s,

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:27.255
with x minus c less than delta,
we get that f of x minus f of c

00:21:27.255 --> 00:21:28.130
is less than epsilon.

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:37.090
So a function being continuous
means that for all epsilon

00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:39.670
you can find delta depending
on one of these points,

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:43.810
depending on c so that if I
had this, then I have this.

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:47.140
Uniform continuity
says you can find delta

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.105
that works across the board.

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:03.000
So I'm going to try and make
an analogy that hopefully I

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.540
don't have to cut
out of this lecture.

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:08.440
But it's a bit like this.

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:11.700
Let's take a trip
down memory lane

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:13.395
and imagine being at a party.

00:22:15.936 --> 00:22:17.730
So you know everybody's
in the party

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:22.230
and let's say that
everybody can hear,

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:24.730
their ears work
just about the same,

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:26.970
and the goal is to
try and understand

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:29.370
each other's
conversation, try and hear

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:32.490
each other's conversations.

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:39.940
Now, in order for me to hear
this person's conversation,

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:42.250
depending on how
loud they talk, I

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:45.550
have to be close enough
to be able to hear them.

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:48.520
And this changes from person
to person in the room.

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:53.390
Maybe I can stand a foot away
from this person over here.

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:56.440
Maybe this person over
here is a low talker

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.360
and I have to be
almost up in their face

00:22:58.360 --> 00:22:59.590
to be able to hear them.

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:01.390
Maybe that person
just whispers and I

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:04.900
have to be almost nose to
nose to be able to hear them.

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:07.250
That's a bit like a
function being continuous.

00:23:10.044 --> 00:23:15.450
The threshold of hearing what
they're saying is the epsilon

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:18.030
and I have to change my
delta depending on what point

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:20.220
I'm at so that I can hear them.

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:29.080
Now, uniform continuity,
is kind of like everybody's

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:33.950
more or less speaking
around the same level,

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:36.290
speaking at the same loudness.

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:40.640
So I just can be within,
say, one foot of everybody

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.260
and be able to understand them.

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:45.550
Go to this person if I'm within
one foot I can hear them well.

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:48.650
If I go to this person
and within one foot

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:51.500
I can hear them well, and so on.

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:56.900
So that's kind of at
least a loose analogy

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.510
of the difference between
continuity and uniform

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:00.260
continuity.

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:11.330
So this is a reasonably
interesting definition.

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:13.720
So we should see
examples and negate it.

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:21.340
First off, you should be
able to convince yourself

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:23.200
that a function that's
uniformly continuous

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.730
is actually continuous.

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:27.030
I'm not going to write
the proof of that down.

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:30.280
It follows essentially
straight from the definition.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:45.030
But let's look at a function,
which is uniformly continuous.

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:54.140
So the function f of x equals
x squared on the interval 0,

00:24:54.140 --> 00:25:01.830
1 is uniformly continuous.

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:07.570
So what's the proof?

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:09.320
I want you to notice
I'm going to use kind

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:14.150
of in a very essential
way that we're

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:15.680
on this closed and
bounded interval.

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:21.230
So we need to show
that for every epsilon,

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:24.355
there exists a delta so that
no matter what two points--

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:31.320
So if you like, here's a picture
that goes along with this--

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:40.020
so that if I look at
maybe two points that

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:43.020
are close to each
other less than delta,

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:52.930
their function's value
is within epsilon.

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:56.200
And so let's say I'm
on an interval a, b.

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.150
But not just this point,
I could go over here

00:25:58.150 --> 00:26:02.600
to two other points that are
within delta of each other.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:13.300
And if I look at the function
evaluated at the two points,

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.340
then the difference
between these two guys

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:16.465
is also less than epsilon.

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:25.740
So I can move through
the party and as long

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:30.390
as I'm close enough within a
uniform distance to somebody,

00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:33.490
I can hear them just fine.

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:39.130
So what a nice trip
down memory lane when we

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:42.020
could be around other people.

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:44.380
So let's show this function
is uniformly continuous.

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:45.790
Let epsilon be positive.

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:56.110
Choose delta to
be epsilon over 2.

00:26:56.110 --> 00:27:03.050
Now, you see this delta
just depends on epsilon,

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:12.920
then if x and c are in 0, 1, and
x minus c is less than delta,

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:16.690
then if I compute
the difference, x

00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:22.000
squared minus c
squared, I can write

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.920
as x plus c times x minus c.

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:28.660
And now I use the
triangle inequality,

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:34.660
this is less than or
equal to x minus c.

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:38.520
Now, these guys are in 0, 1,
so their absolute values always

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.650
bounded by 1.

00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:44.790
So this is less than
or equal to 1 plus 1,

00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:49.590
and then x minus c
is bounded by delta,

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:51.690
which equals 2 times
delta, and delta

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:53.280
is chosen to be epsilon over 2.

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:55.860
So I get epsilon.

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:58.200
Now, again, how would
you choose delta?

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.930
So it looks like I just chose
this delta out of nowhere.

00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:03.330
In practice, how do
you choose delta?

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:05.340
This is the computation you do.

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:08.220
You take x squared minus
c squared, split it,

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.120
you have this.

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:14.370
You can estimate with what
you know above by 2 here

00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:15.750
times delta.

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:19.200
So how do you choose delta
so that 2 times delta

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.420
is, say, equal to epsilon?

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:23.940
You choose delta to
be epsilon over 2.

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:39.660
So let's negate this
definition and then look at 1

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:43.050
over x once again
and check to see

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:44.550
if it's uniformly continuous.

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:45.840
We'll show it's not.

00:28:45.840 --> 00:29:00.150
So the negation f from s to r
is not uniformly continuous.

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:18.880
So I saw a little bit of the
new Borat movie that came out.

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:22.720
So I almost wanted to say
f is uniformly continuous.

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:23.380
Not.

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:24.730
But I didn't.

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:27.610
It's not uniformly continuous.

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:30.850
And now you negate the
rest of the definition.

00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:36.280
If there exists some bad
epsilon, such that no matter

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:45.820
what delta you choose, there
exists some bad x and c

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:51.370
and s, such that they're
close to each other,

00:29:51.370 --> 00:30:00.610
but the values are not
bigger than or equal to.

00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:15.730
So let's revisit 1 over x.

00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:30.820
This is not uniformly continuous
on the open interval 0, 1.

00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:33.040
So you see that this
function is continuous

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:37.230
but it's not
uniformly continuous.

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:39.480
We just proved that a minute
ago that it's continuous.

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:43.460
So let me now give you the
proof that this function is

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:44.930
not uniformly continuous.

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:49.880
And what's the idea behind this?

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:52.440
Here's one.

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:54.950
This is not to scale,
but there's one

00:30:54.950 --> 00:31:04.670
as well, and 1 over x
shoots up to plus infinity

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:05.930
as x approaches 0.

00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:11.660
So what uniform
continuity says is

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:14.510
that if I take any two
points in the interval that

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:16.730
are close to each
other, then the outputs

00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:20.900
have to be close to each other.

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:24.450
Continuity, remember,
says if I fix a point,

00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:26.340
then as long as I'm
close to that point,

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:28.440
the outputs will be
close to each other.

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.840
Uniform says, no
matter what two points

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:33.660
you choose, as long as
they're close together,

00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:37.170
the outputs will be close
together in a controlled way.

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:42.420
Now, if I take two points
very close to each other here,

00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:51.170
very close to 0, they can be
pretty close to each other.

00:31:51.170 --> 00:32:00.690
I mean, their values
can be quite large.

00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:06.350
Even though the difference
between the arguments

00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:08.960
are small, the values
can be quite large

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.840
just because 1 over x shoots up.

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:14.640
So let's quantify this.

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:17.520
I have to tell you what
the bad epsilon not is.

00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:23.510
Choose epsilon not equals 2.

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:27.575
Now, any epsilon not
will work just fine.

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:34.690
Let delta be positive.

00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:40.080
So now we have to find x and
c and s within distance delta

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:53.790
to each other whose values
vary by at least two.

00:32:53.790 --> 00:33:07.290
So let's choose c to be the
minimum of delta and 1/2,

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:10.560
and I'm going to choose
x to be c over 2.

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:19.230
So just ignoring this half for
a minute, c is equal to delta,

00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:22.500
x is equal to delta
over 2, and then

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:26.340
1 over c minus 1 over x is
going to be 2 over delta.

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:28.080
And if delta is
very small, that's

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.610
certainly bigger
than or equal to 2.

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:32.550
But I had to throw in this 1/2
here because I chose epsilon

00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:35.610
not to be 2, and
delta's arbitrary.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:44.000
So then we see that
x minus c, this

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.900
equals c over 2, which is
certainly less than or equal to

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:52.130
since c is the minimum
of delta and 1 over 1/2

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:54.410
is less than delta over 2,
which is less than delta.

00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:05.490
And if we compute 1 over x
minus 1 over c, this is--

00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:19.830
remember x is c over 2, so
this 1 over x is 2 over c, so 1

00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:20.489
over c.

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:29.969
And now from c being less
than or equal to 1 over 1/2m

00:34:29.969 --> 00:34:33.020
I get that 1 over c is going to
be bigger than or equal to 2.

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:53.520
And that's the end of the proof.

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:59.340
So we see that even though
these two arguments are

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:04.020
very close to each other, the
outputs are, in fact, separated

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:06.510
by some fixed distance.

00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:09.180
At least two.

00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:12.570
But we could actually make it
bigger than 3, bigger than 4,

00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:13.395
whatever you like.

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:29.070
And I'm not going to
go over this example.

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:36.790
But in fact, I'll leave
it to you or maybe I'll

00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:38.500
put it on the
assignment, f of x equals

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:48.970
x squared is not
uniformly continuous on r.

00:35:48.970 --> 00:35:52.660
So we saw that it's uniformly
continuous on a closed interval

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:59.650
0, 1, but it's not uniformly
continuous on all of r.

00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:02.920
The reason being again
kind of because x squared

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:04.370
is starting to get big.

00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:07.670
So I can take two things
close to each other,

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:10.570
stick it into x squared,
and their outputs

00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:13.540
could be very different
from each other.

00:36:16.795 --> 00:36:18.420
Didn't write out the
proof of this one,

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:26.720
so we're going to go by a little
bit by the seat of our pants.

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:35.820
So we want to show this is
not uniformly continuous.

00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:44.250
So I think epsilon 0 equals
1 is going to work just fine.

00:36:50.373 --> 00:36:53.730
Let delta be
positive, and the idea

00:36:53.730 --> 00:37:00.120
is we want to choose
x to be some number.

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:03.720
Let's call it a plus--

00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:15.570
well, c will be some number,
and c equals some number,

00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:20.310
x equals c plus delta over 2.

00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:22.590
So this is kind of scratch
work off to the side.

00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:26.700
And let's see if we
can somehow choose c.

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:35.190
So first off, x minus
c will be delta over 2,

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:36.870
which is less than delta.

00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:43.050
And now let's see
if we can choose c

00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:47.520
so that x squared
minus c squared

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:51.260
is bigger than or equal to 1.

00:37:58.790 --> 00:38:03.500
So c is kind of the thing
that we get to play with here.

00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:05.720
I mean, this is how
it actually goes

00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:09.590
if you want to figure out the
proof before you write it down,

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:12.830
the scratch work to the side.

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:15.350
So choose c so that this--

00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:18.908
now, let's start
off with the thing

00:38:18.908 --> 00:38:20.450
that we're trying
to bound from below

00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:22.310
and start computing some stuff.

00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:24.500
This is equal to x plus c--

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:26.120
and c will be positive.

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:30.690
So this will be c, and
x will be positive.

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:38.360
So x plus c times
x minus c; now x

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:50.980
plus c will be 2c plus
delta over 2; x minus c

00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:54.430
will be delta over 2.

00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:02.130
So far all of these
things are equality,

00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:09.460
and we get this is
equal to 2c plus--

00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:14.650
so delta is 2c plus
delta squared over 2,

00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:17.230
and here we're going
to choose c positive.

00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:20.740
So we're trying to show it's
not uniformly continuous on r.

00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:27.618
So we just need to find a
value of c and a value of x so

00:39:27.618 --> 00:39:29.660
that they're within delta
distance to each other,

00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:33.350
but their outputs are
bigger than or equal to 1.

00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:36.560
So far if c is just
something positive,

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:39.962
x is c plus delta over
2, then they're close.

00:39:39.962 --> 00:39:41.420
Their difference,
however, is going

00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:46.850
to be just by this computation
equal to 2c plus delta over 2

00:39:46.850 --> 00:39:50.250
times delta over 2 squared.

00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:53.540
Now delta squared over 2
is always non-negative,

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:57.170
so it's certainly bigger than
or equal to delta times c.

00:39:57.170 --> 00:39:59.960
And now remember we
wanted this thing

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:01.550
to be bigger than or equal to 1.

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:04.370
Right now we have it's bigger
than or equal to delta c.

00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:12.810
So let's choose c
to be 1 over delta,

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:14.820
and let's see that that works.

00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:24.060
Choose c to be 1 over
delta, x to be 1 over delta.

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:27.390
So c plus delta over 2.

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:32.730
Then these two values are close.

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:38.610
x minus c equals delta
over 2 is less than delta,

00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:45.840
and x squared minus c
squared equals x plus c times

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:50.704
x minus c.

00:40:50.704 --> 00:40:58.870
x plus c as we did a minute
ago is going to be 2 over delta

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:00.250
plus delta over 2.

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:01.825
That's x plus c.

00:41:01.825 --> 00:41:06.554
x minus c is equal
to delta over 2,

00:41:06.554 --> 00:41:10.690
which equals 1, plus
delta squared over 4,

00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:14.500
which is bigger than or
equal to 1, our bad epsilon.

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:20.530
So f of x equals x squared is
not uniformly continuous on r,

00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:22.483
even though it is uniformly
continuous on this

00:41:22.483 --> 00:41:23.650
closed and bounded interval.

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:35.540
So uniform continuity
is really a relationship

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:41.390
between a function and the
domain on which it's defined.

00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:49.420
So this is kind of
to wrap up our theme

00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:52.630
of continuous functions
and how they're

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:54.640
behaved on closed and
bounded intervals.

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:57.340
And we see here that
uniform continuity

00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:01.570
is a much stronger notion
than continuity, as I've said.

00:42:01.570 --> 00:42:04.240
I mean, you can easily
prove from the definition

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:07.480
that if a function is
uniformly continuous on s,

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:09.180
then it's continuous on s.

00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:19.000
And we've seen that in general
the reverse inclusion does not

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:19.580
hold.

00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:22.855
So let me just write
this up as a remark.

00:42:28.351 --> 00:42:40.610
In general, f
uniformly continuous

00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:46.320
implies that f is continuous.

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:48.165
This just follows
from the definition.

00:42:48.165 --> 00:42:49.415
This is not difficult to show.

00:42:56.050 --> 00:43:13.030
But the converse does not
hold, as we've just seen

00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:15.160
We have two examples
here. f of x

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:18.550
equals 1 over x on the
open interval 0, 1, which

00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:21.610
is continuous, but it's
not uniformly continuous;

00:43:21.610 --> 00:43:24.560
and then we have the function
f of x equals x squared,

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:28.600
which is not uniformly
continuous on r.

00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:31.450
But in fact, it is
uniformly continuous

00:43:31.450 --> 00:43:34.750
on this closed and
bounded interval 0, 1.

00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:36.730
This example here,
though, is, in fact,

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:44.620
the rule; that if I'm
looking at a function

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:48.070
on a closed and bounded
interval, then, in fact,

00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:49.760
these two notions
are equivalent.

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:51.310
So that's the following theorem.

00:43:55.980 --> 00:44:00.830
Let f be a function
from a to b to r.

00:44:00.830 --> 00:44:06.950
So closed and bounded interval
now, not just an arbitrary set.

00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:14.240
Then f is continuous
on a, b, meaning

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:18.400
it's continuous at
every point, if and only

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:28.390
if f is uniformly
continuous on a, b.

00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:33.010
And the necessity of working on
a closed and bounded interval

00:44:33.010 --> 00:44:36.640
is seen again by
this example we had

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:39.310
here of f of x
equals 1 over x and f

00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:44.160
of x equals x squared
on r and 0, 1.

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:48.580
But as long as we're looking on
a closed and bounded interval,

00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:51.760
continuous is equivalent
to uniform continuity.

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:54.355
Now, this is also not the
sharpest thing you can say.

00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:01.810
In fact, what you can
say is that if I replace

00:45:01.810 --> 00:45:05.470
this with what's called
a compact set, which

00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:07.305
I may put in the
assignment, I may not,

00:45:07.305 --> 00:45:08.680
then the statement
is still true.

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:11.800
And that's in some sense
the sharpest statement.

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:16.530
But I think this is
interesting enough

00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:20.750
to just work on a closed
and bounded interval.

00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:22.655
So let's prove this.

00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:44.040
I leave this to you as an
exercise, uniform continuity

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:46.620
implying continuity.

00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:47.490
I leave it to you.

00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:56.170
And I will do more
difficult one,

00:45:56.170 --> 00:46:01.360
and we'll use kind
of a philosophy

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:03.880
like we did in the
previous lecture

00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:05.770
where we use the
definition of continuity

00:46:05.770 --> 00:46:10.150
or this theorem about continuity
in terms of sequences and also

00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:12.940
the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem.

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:18.820
Good.

00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:20.680
We still have the
negation of the definition

00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:25.820
of uniform continuity, and
that's what we'll need.

00:46:28.850 --> 00:46:33.860
So we're going to
prove f continuous

00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:35.840
implies uniformly
continuous, and we're going

00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:37.170
to do this by contradiction.

00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:43.760
So suppose f is
continuous on a, b,

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:45.470
but not uniformly continuous.

00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:10.590
And then we're going to
break the universe some way,

00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:13.620
which shows that our assumption
that f is not uniformly

00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:16.260
continuous does not hold.

00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:25.280
So we use this negation
of the definition

00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:30.350
of uniform continuity, which
says that there exists delta 0.

00:47:30.350 --> 00:47:31.820
So let me write this out.

00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:40.390
I'm just going to
rewrite this here,

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:43.660
then there exists a delta
0, such that for all delta

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:50.770
positive, there
exists x, c and a, b,

00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:58.800
which depend on delta, such that
x minus c is less than delta

00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:07.770
and f of x minus f
of c is greater than

00:48:07.770 --> 00:48:09.000
or equal to epsilon not.

00:48:12.610 --> 00:48:16.930
Now, this holds for every delta.

00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:21.970
You can find x and c so that
x minus c is less than delta

00:48:21.970 --> 00:48:24.010
and f of x minus
f of c is greater

00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:25.690
than or equal to epsilon not.

00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:30.490
So let's choose delta to be 1
over n for each natural number

00:48:30.490 --> 00:48:41.210
n, and for all natural
numbers n, there exists

00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:46.970
xn, cn, and a, b, such that--

00:48:46.970 --> 00:48:50.160
so this is the statement now
with delta equals 1 over n.

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:55.190
xn minus cn is
less than 1 over n,

00:48:55.190 --> 00:49:06.070
and f of x sub n minus f of c
sub n is bigger than or equal

00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:07.030
to epsilon 0.

00:49:10.970 --> 00:49:19.490
Now, I have two sequences
here, and they're

00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:22.560
bounded because they're in this
closed and bounded interval.

00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:27.350
So I can pass to a subsequence
of one of them to start

00:49:27.350 --> 00:49:32.410
by the Bolzano-Weierstrass
theorem--

00:49:32.410 --> 00:49:34.420
not B-Z, Bolzano-Weierstrass.

00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:37.330
I think that's probably
somewhere else in the lecture

00:49:37.330 --> 00:49:40.420
or the previous I wrote
B-Z, but I meant B-W

00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:42.145
by Bolzano-Weierstrass--

00:49:44.820 --> 00:50:05.110
there exists subsequent xn sub k
of x sub n and x and a, b, such

00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:13.030
that limit as k goes to infinity
of x sub n sub k equals x.

00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:16.630
So Bolzano-Weierstrass
from any bounded sequence

00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:18.580
we can find a
convergent subsequence.

00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:22.800
And because this subsequence
is always between a and b,

00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:24.960
the limit x will
be between a and b.

00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:42.190
Now, since the
subsequence cn sub k

00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:52.990
is bounded between a and b--

00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:55.960
so I have a subsequence
of x sub n sub k,

00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:59.500
and I then obtain a
subsequence of the c sub n

00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:03.400
by just picking these
integers to be the same.

00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:09.742
And so now that
subsequence is of the c sub

00:51:09.742 --> 00:51:12.840
n is they're all
coming from a, b.

00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:14.970
So that's bounded by a, b.

00:51:14.970 --> 00:51:15.900
So it's bounded.

00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:22.020
So by Bolzano-Weierstrass
applied now

00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:32.130
to this subsequence, there
exists a subsequence c sub n

00:51:32.130 --> 00:51:45.700
sub k of j, of c sub n
sub k, and an element c

00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:53.870
in a, b, such that
the limit as j

00:51:53.870 --> 00:52:00.100
goes to infinity of c sub
n sub k sub j equals c.

00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:08.100
So I found a subsequence
of the x of n's, and now I

00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:11.700
look at a corresponding
subsequence of the c sub

00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:16.897
n's where now the subsequent cn
sub k's are coming from the n

00:52:16.897 --> 00:52:19.920
sub k's chosen for this
subsequence, that's

00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:21.790
still a bounded sequence.

00:52:21.790 --> 00:52:23.970
So by Bolzano-Weierstrass,
I can take

00:52:23.970 --> 00:52:27.210
a subsequence of
that and an element

00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:29.580
c so that I have convergence.

00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:39.580
So now let me just summarize.

00:52:55.360 --> 00:53:15.900
So in summary, the sequences
x sub n sub k of j--

00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:19.620
so now this is even a
subsequence of x sub n sub k

00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:22.440
and c sub n sub k sub j.

00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:36.060
These are subsequences of
the original sequences x sub

00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:39.751
n and c sub n.

00:53:51.330 --> 00:54:00.860
And this x and c and a, b,
such that the limit as j

00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:08.870
goes to infinity of x sub n
sub j equals x, and limit as j

00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:19.000
goes to infinity of z
sub n sub kj equals c.

00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:27.260
Now, I claim x equals c.

00:54:37.530 --> 00:54:45.830
Now, 0 is certainly bigger than
or equal to x sub n sub k sub

00:54:45.830 --> 00:54:50.660
j minus c sub n sub k
sub j, which is less

00:54:50.660 --> 00:54:54.050
than or equal to by
how we've defined

00:54:54.050 --> 00:54:59.600
these sequences is less than or
equal to 1 over n sub k sub j.

00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:13.160
So first off, by the
definition of subsequences,

00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:16.430
j is always bigger than
or equal to n sub k--

00:55:16.430 --> 00:55:18.980
n sub k sub j is always
bigger than or equal to j.

00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:22.730
So this is always less
than or equal to 1 over j.

00:55:22.730 --> 00:55:26.450
This is just a consequence of
how some sequences are defined.

00:55:26.450 --> 00:55:27.950
You always have to
move to the right

00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:31.910
after you've made a choice
of entry in the sequence

00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:35.540
that you're going to take as
an element of your sequence.

00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:41.250
So 0 is bounded,
bounds this from below,

00:55:41.250 --> 00:55:44.940
and is bounded above by 1
over j, which converges to 0.

00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:49.810
So the middle thing has to
converge to 0 by the squeeze

00:55:49.810 --> 00:55:50.310
theorem.

00:56:05.110 --> 00:56:08.320
But these two things,
that converges to x, this

00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:11.290
converges to c.

00:56:11.290 --> 00:56:15.310
And so the absolute value
of x minus c equals 0,

00:56:15.310 --> 00:56:17.890
and therefore x equals c.

00:56:29.753 --> 00:56:30.920
Now, we're almost home free.

00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:47.040
This limit as j goes to infinity
of x sub n sub k sub j equals

00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:56.200
c, and limit as j goes
to infinity c sub n sub k

00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:58.705
sub j equals c.

00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:13.430
Now, where's the kicker?

00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:19.490
This.

00:57:19.490 --> 00:57:22.700
So these are subsequences
of x sub n and c sub n.

00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:31.800
But each of those sequences
is converging to a number c.

00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:37.530
So by the theorem
about continuity,

00:57:37.530 --> 00:57:43.410
since f is continuous
at c, this implies

00:57:43.410 --> 00:57:49.670
that 0 equals the limit
as j goes to infinity

00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:53.120
of f of x sub n sub--

00:57:57.350 --> 00:58:01.160
write it this way.
f of c minus f of c

00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:17.920
equals limit j goes to infinity
of f of n's of c sub n sub k

00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:21.797
sub j, which is bigger
than or equal to epsilon 0.

00:58:21.797 --> 00:58:23.380
All of these are
supposed to be bigger

00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:26.560
than or equal to some fixed
epsilon 0, which is positive.

00:58:29.650 --> 00:58:31.330
But we've just shown
that's equal to 0.

00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:36.302
And that's the contradiction.

00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:50.426
Thus, f is uniformly
continuous on a, b.

00:58:55.570 --> 00:59:01.130
So that concludes what
we'll say about continuity.

00:59:01.130 --> 00:59:03.590
And as you'll note
kind of going forward,

00:59:03.590 --> 00:59:05.210
we're going to
cover topics faster.

00:59:05.210 --> 00:59:08.270
That's just because we have
more machinery to work with.

00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:14.820
At the start it was very
slow going just because one,

00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:17.200
it's the start of your
first proof based class.

00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:19.445
So I'm going to
go slow; and two,

00:59:19.445 --> 00:59:20.820
we didn't have
much to work with.

00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:24.180
We just had the
real numbers are in

00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:26.350
ordered field with the
least upper bound property.

00:59:26.350 --> 00:59:31.260
But now we've covered sequences,
continuity we know more,

00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:37.455
and it'll be easier to
prove new things and also

00:59:37.455 --> 00:59:41.580
hopefully familiarity
with proofs

00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:45.810
is getting better so
that my arguments can

00:59:45.810 --> 00:59:51.750
be a little bit shorter
and not so involved.

00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:55.850
So we're moving on
to something now.

00:59:55.850 --> 00:59:58.460
This is supposed to
be about calculus.

00:59:58.460 --> 01:00:02.060
We've covered
limits, continuity.

01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:07.870
The next big topic has
to be differentiability.

01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:19.560
So this is a new chapter
about the derivative.

01:00:22.530 --> 01:00:29.410
So let me first give you
the precise definition.

01:00:29.410 --> 01:00:48.180
So first off, I'll be
saying, let I be an interval,

01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:54.310
f goes from I to R,
and c an element of I.

01:00:54.310 --> 01:00:55.900
Now, when I say an
interval, I don't

01:00:55.900 --> 01:00:58.690
mean it has to be closed
and bounded like ones

01:00:58.690 --> 01:00:59.830
we've been working on.

01:00:59.830 --> 01:01:01.945
I don't mean it has to be open.

01:01:01.945 --> 01:01:05.350
It doesn't have to be a bounded
interval like from 0 to 1.

01:01:05.350 --> 01:01:07.420
It could be 0 to infinity.

01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:10.780
It can include the endpoints,
except, of course, infinity.

01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:12.430
But I think what
I mean and I don't

01:01:12.430 --> 01:01:15.670
have to write all this out for
what exactly an interval is.

01:01:15.670 --> 01:01:20.320
So let I be an interval and f
be a function from I to R and c

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:23.700
a point of I.

01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:30.047
So first off, convince
yourselves of this,

01:01:30.047 --> 01:01:31.630
but I think it should
be pretty clear.

01:01:41.090 --> 01:01:44.810
For an interval, every
point in the interval

01:01:44.810 --> 01:01:47.850
is a cluster point
of the interval.

01:01:47.850 --> 01:01:53.700
This is not too
difficult to prove.

01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:55.470
And I will not require
you to prove it,

01:01:55.470 --> 01:01:56.970
but I'm just saying
this because I'm

01:01:56.970 --> 01:01:58.350
about to define a limit at c.

01:01:58.350 --> 01:02:09.650
So it had better be a
cluster point of a set

01:02:09.650 --> 01:02:11.390
that this limit
is defined using.

01:02:11.390 --> 01:02:17.060
So of I, take away c.

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:22.320
And if you don't
like the statement,

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:26.010
just forget I even wrote
it and we'll continue on.

01:02:29.314 --> 01:02:39.360
You say f is
differentiable at c--

01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:46.200
so this is the new
bit of terminology.

01:02:46.200 --> 01:03:01.510
If the limit x goes to c, f of
x minus f of c over x minus c

01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:03.910
exists.

01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:07.450
If this limit exists, we say the
functions differentiable at c,

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:19.490
and we use a notation f prime
f apostrophe c for this limit.

01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:48.710
If f is differentiable at
every point of the interval I,

01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:51.870
we'd get a new
function, this function

01:03:51.870 --> 01:04:15.670
f prime of c, which we
denote the function that's

01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:18.100
a derivative of f
as f prime or dfdx.

01:04:24.550 --> 01:04:27.370
So the simplest guys that are
differential are, of course,

01:04:27.370 --> 01:04:28.090
polynomials.

01:04:28.090 --> 01:04:30.340
I think this is one of the
first things you learn back

01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:32.260
in calculus.

01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:37.530
And I'm not going
to go through what

01:04:37.530 --> 01:04:38.970
this is supposed to represent.

01:04:38.970 --> 01:04:41.370
You know this from
calculus, the best way

01:04:41.370 --> 01:04:43.620
to say what this
number represents

01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:46.110
is the instantaneous rate
of change of the function

01:04:46.110 --> 01:04:47.340
f at this point.

01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:52.980
How is f changing at that point
in the sense of increasing,

01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:54.150
decreasing, and so on?

01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:59.320
Or if you like,
you interpret this

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:01.720
as being the slope
of the line that

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:04.810
is perfectly
tangent to the curve

01:05:04.810 --> 01:05:06.550
to the graph of the function f.

01:05:06.550 --> 01:05:11.800
But what does that mean
to be tangent to the graph

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:13.220
of a function?

01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:16.010
So that takes a
bit of explaining.

01:05:16.010 --> 01:05:21.710
So I'm not going to get into
what the actual interpretation

01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:22.993
of this number is.

01:05:22.993 --> 01:05:25.160
I think you have a pretty
good idea of what that is.

01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:29.950
We're just going to start
proving some properties of it.

01:05:29.950 --> 01:05:32.790
So the simplest
example of a function

01:05:32.790 --> 01:05:40.830
which is differentiable
is that of a monomial.

01:05:40.830 --> 01:05:50.925
So f of x equals x to the n.

01:05:50.925 --> 01:05:53.580
Let's put even a
number in there.

01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:57.010
So let's write it this way.

01:05:57.010 --> 01:06:07.270
Let f have been R in
the natural number 0,

01:06:07.270 --> 01:06:16.340
then function f of x equals
alpha times x to the n

01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:17.470
is differentiable.

01:06:22.176 --> 01:06:24.090
So I should have
said here as well

01:06:24.090 --> 01:06:26.190
if a function is
differentiable at every point

01:06:26.190 --> 01:06:29.790
where it's defined,
or if a function is

01:06:29.790 --> 01:06:32.550
differentiable at every
point in its domain I,

01:06:32.550 --> 01:06:35.220
then we just say the
function is differentiable.

01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:45.510
So then this monomial is
differential and for all

01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:54.225
c f prime of c equals n times
alpha x to the n minus 1, c.

01:07:02.790 --> 01:07:06.120
So let's give a proof
of that, and we'll

01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:10.995
use this kind of simple formula.

01:07:15.710 --> 01:07:25.770
So let's take a look
at x minus c times

01:07:25.770 --> 01:07:33.680
this kind of weird looking
sum to x, n minus 1 minus j,

01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:35.460
c to the j.

01:07:39.350 --> 01:07:44.930
So multiply the x
through, I get sum from j

01:07:44.930 --> 01:07:54.140
equals 0 to n minus 1, x to the
n minus j, c to the j minus--

01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:56.990
and I'm not going to use
j again in the sum when

01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:58.790
I carry this c through.

01:07:58.790 --> 01:08:01.250
I'm going to use l--

01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:11.000
sum from l equals 0 to n
minus 1, x to the n minus--

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:21.479
I'll put it this way-- j
plus 1, c to the j plus 1, l,

01:08:21.479 --> 01:08:23.850
and now I'm going to make
a change of variables

01:08:23.850 --> 01:08:28.410
in this second sum and
let j equals l plus 1.

01:08:32.910 --> 01:08:36.720
So in that case, when l
equals 0, j starts at 1.

01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:41.100
When l hits n minus
1, j equals n.

01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:46.410
So this equals the sum from
j equals 0, n minus 1, x,

01:08:46.410 --> 01:08:57.400
n minus j, c to the j minus sum
j equals 1 to n, x, n minus j,

01:08:57.400 --> 01:08:59.750
c to the j.

01:08:59.750 --> 01:09:03.670
So it's the same
terms in the sum,

01:09:03.670 --> 01:09:05.590
except starting at
different places.

01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:08.069
So what doesn't
get killed here is

01:09:08.069 --> 01:09:12.779
the j equals 0 term because
this one starts at j equals 1.

01:09:12.779 --> 01:09:14.279
This one ends at n.

01:09:14.279 --> 01:09:16.390
And so it kills
the n minus 1 term.

01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:18.300
So the only thing that
survives from this sum

01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:24.000
is the j equals 0 term, x to
the n minus 0, c to the 0 minus.

01:09:27.305 --> 01:09:32.490
And now from here, everything
gets killed except the n terms.

01:09:32.490 --> 01:09:36.120
So x to the n
minus n, c to the n

01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:39.580
equals x to the n
minus c to the n.

01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:46.320
So this is therefore
equal to this.

01:09:50.130 --> 01:09:52.450
So we use this to
compute this limit.

01:09:52.450 --> 01:09:56.730
So then f prime of c
is equal to the limit

01:09:56.730 --> 01:10:02.850
as x goes to c of
x to the n alpha

01:10:02.850 --> 01:10:07.060
times x to the n times
alpha times c to the n,

01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:08.370
where x minus c--

01:10:08.370 --> 01:10:09.760
now, alpha is just a number.

01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:11.450
It can pop out--

01:10:11.450 --> 01:10:15.560
x to the n minus c to the
n divided by x minus c

01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:17.990
is this thing
divided by x minus c.

01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:23.840
So this is equal to alpha times
the limit as x goes to c of sum

01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:33.050
from j equals 0 to n minus 1,
x to the n minus 1 minus j, c

01:10:33.050 --> 01:10:35.540
to the j.

01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:38.960
Now, this is just
a polynomial in x.

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:40.860
Polynomials are
continuous functions.

01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:44.990
So the limit as x goes to c
is just to plug in c to x.

01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:48.530
And so this equals
alpha times sum from j

01:10:48.530 --> 01:10:55.400
equals 0 to n minus 1, c to
the n minus 1 minus j times

01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:57.230
j equals--

01:10:57.230 --> 01:10:59.900
so c to the n minus 1
minus j times c to the j

01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:02.210
gives me c to the n minus 1--

01:11:02.210 --> 01:11:03.980
I'm summing in j.

01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:06.380
There's no j here, so
that just pops out--

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:16.480
times the sum j
equals 0, n minus 1.

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:19.510
And there's n of the times 1.

01:11:19.510 --> 01:11:20.830
So this is just n.

01:11:24.275 --> 01:11:25.150
And that's the proof.

01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:32.010
So I'm sure you saw
that at some point.

01:11:32.010 --> 01:11:35.850
Next time we'll give an example
of a function which is not

01:11:35.850 --> 01:11:37.440
differentiable out of a point.

01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:39.660
Of course, I think you
probably already know

01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:42.780
this, f of x equals the
absolute value of x.

01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:45.270
If there's time at
some point, I'll

01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:50.570
go over an example
of a function, which

01:11:50.570 --> 01:11:52.780
was very surprising to
people at one point.

01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:54.350
So now that we have
differentiability

01:11:54.350 --> 01:12:01.790
and continuity on the board, for
a long time since dead people

01:12:01.790 --> 01:12:06.970
believed that if you have
a continuous function,

01:12:06.970 --> 01:12:08.550
any continuous
function, then there

01:12:08.550 --> 01:12:13.170
has to be at least one point
where it's differentiable.

01:12:13.170 --> 01:12:16.430
There must be at least one
point where it's differentiable.

01:12:16.430 --> 01:12:18.560
And people tried to prove
that for a long time

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:20.870
and they couldn't
because it's false.

01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:23.810
Weierstrass, who was, again kind
of the godfather of everything

01:12:23.810 --> 01:12:28.700
we're doing, came up with
a whole class of examples

01:12:28.700 --> 01:12:31.520
of functions that
are continuous,

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:34.470
but are differentiable nowhere.

01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:38.480
They're not differentiable
at a single point.

01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:45.150
And perhaps depending on time,
will go over this example.

01:12:45.150 --> 01:12:48.110
And think I'll stop there.
