00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.457
Last time we saw things about
gradients and directional

00:00:29.457 --> 00:00:32.706
derivatives.
Before that we studied how to

00:00:32.706 --> 00:00:37.230
look for minima and maxima of
functions of several variables.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.770
And today we are going to look
again at min/max problems but in

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.432
a different setting,
namely, one for variables that

00:00:45.432 --> 00:00:49.418
are not independent.
And so what we will see is you

00:00:49.418 --> 00:00:52.390
may have heard of Lagrange
multipliers.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:59.081
And this is the one point in
the term when I can shine with

00:00:59.081 --> 00:01:05.080
my French accent and say
Lagrange's name properly.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.705
OK.
What are Lagrange multipliers

00:01:08.705 --> 00:01:13.128
about?
Well, the goal is to minimize

00:01:13.128 --> 00:01:19.269
or maximize a function of
several variables.

00:01:19.269 --> 00:01:22.477
Let's say, for example,
f of x, y, z,

00:01:22.477 --> 00:01:27.290
but where these variables are
no longer independent.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.803
They are not independent.
That means that there is a

00:01:43.803 --> 00:01:47.527
relation between them.
The relation is maybe some

00:01:47.527 --> 00:01:52.970
equation of the form g of x,
y, z equals some constant.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.433
You take the relation between
x, y, z, you call that g and

00:01:57.433 --> 00:02:02.214
that gives you the constraint.
And your goal is to minimize f

00:02:02.214 --> 00:02:05.778
only of those values of x,
y, z that satisfy the

00:02:05.778 --> 00:02:07.890
constraint.
What is one way to do that?

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.870
Well, one to do that,
if the constraint is very

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:14.370
simple, we can maybe solve for
one of the variables.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.667
Maybe we can solve this
equation for one of the

00:02:17.667 --> 00:02:21.609
variables, plug it back into f,
and then we have a usual

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:25.050
min/max problem that we have
seen how to do.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.437
The problem is sometimes you
cannot actually solve for x,

00:02:28.437 --> 00:02:31.885
y, z in here because this
condition is too complicated and

00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:38.530
then we need a new method.
That is what we are going to do.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.669
Why would we care about that?
Well, one example is actually

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:43.976
in physics.
Maybe you have seen in

00:02:43.976 --> 00:02:47.630
thermodynamics that you study
quantities about gases,

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.582
and those quantities that
involve pressure,

00:02:50.582 --> 00:02:53.234
volume and temperature.
And pressure,

00:02:53.234 --> 00:02:56.289
volume and temperature are not
independent of each other.

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:59.729
I mean you know probably the
equation PV = NRT.

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:01.759
And, of course,
there you could actually solve

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:03.969
to express things in terms of
one or the other.

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:07.161
But sometimes it is more
convenient to keep all three

00:03:07.161 --> 00:03:09.740
variables but treat them as
constrained.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:19.462
It is just an example of a
situation where you might want

00:03:19.462 --> 00:03:24.150
to do this.
Anyway, we will look mostly at

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.282
particular examples,
but just to point out that this

00:03:28.282 --> 00:03:32.090
is useful when you study guesses
in physics.

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.125
The first observation is we
cannot use our usual method of

00:03:35.125 --> 00:03:36.990
looking for critical points of
f.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.547
Because critical points of f
typically will not satisfy this

00:03:40.547 --> 00:03:43.140
condition and so won't be good
solutions.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:49.672
We need something else.
Let's look at an example,

00:03:49.672 --> 00:03:53.970
and we will see how that leads
us to the method.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:03.340
For example,
let's say that I want to find

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:17.737
the point closest to the origin
-- -- on the hyperbola xy equals

00:04:17.737 --> 00:04:23.413
3 in the plane.
That means I have this

00:04:23.413 --> 00:04:26.807
hyperbola, and I am asking
myself what is the point on it

00:04:26.807 --> 00:04:29.050
that is the closest to the
origin?

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.290
I mean we can solve this by
elementary geometry,

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.089
we don't need actually Lagrange
multipliers,

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:38.581
but we are going to do it with
Lagrange multipliers because it

00:04:38.581 --> 00:04:41.519
is a pretty good example.
What does it mean?

00:04:41.519 --> 00:04:47.560
Well, it means that we want to
minimize distance to the origin.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.759
What is the distance to the
origin?

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:53.057
If I have a point,
at coordinates (x,

00:04:53.057 --> 00:04:58.277
y) and then the distance to the
origin is square root of x

00:04:58.277 --> 00:05:02.198
squared plus y squared.
Well, do we really want to

00:05:02.198 --> 00:05:05.040
minimize that or can we minimize
something easier?

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.573
Yeah.
Maybe we can minimize the

00:05:06.573 --> 00:05:14.824
square of a distance.
Let's forget this guy and

00:05:14.824 --> 00:05:23.786
instead -- Actually,
we will minimize f of x,

00:05:23.786 --> 00:05:27.890
y equals x squared plus y
squared,

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:39.416
that looks better, 
subject to the constraint xy =

00:05:39.416 --> 00:05:44.568
3.
And so we will call this thing

00:05:44.568 --> 00:05:50.740
g of x, y to illustrate the
general method.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:58.801
Let's look at a picture.
Here you can see in yellow the

00:05:58.801 --> 00:06:02.502
hyperbola xy equals three.
And we are going to look for

00:06:02.502 --> 00:06:05.040
the points that are the closest
to the origin.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.181
What can we do?
Well, for example,

00:06:08.181 --> 00:06:13.056
we can plot the function x
squared plus y squared,

00:06:13.056 --> 00:06:17.340
function f.
That is the contour plot of f

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.966
with a hyperbola on top of it.
Now let's see what we can do

00:06:21.966 --> 00:06:25.620
with that.
Well, let's ask ourselves,

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.195
for example,
if I look at points where f

00:06:30.195 --> 00:06:34.031
equals 20 now.
I think I am at 20 but you

00:06:34.031 --> 00:06:37.645
cannot really see it.
That is a circle with a point

00:06:37.645 --> 00:06:41.180
whose distant square is 20.
Well, can I find a solution if

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.380
I am on the hyperbola?
Yes, there are four points at

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.709
this distance.
Can I do better?

00:06:46.709 --> 00:06:49.060
Well, let's decrease for
distance.

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.550
Yes, we can still find points
on the hyperbola and so on.

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:56.010
Except if we go too low then
there are no points on this

00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:00.032
circle anymore in the hyperbola.
If we decrease the value of f

00:07:00.032 --> 00:07:03.863
that we want to look at that
will somehow limit value beyond

00:07:03.863 --> 00:07:07.240
which we cannot go,
and that is the minimum of f.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:13.040
We are trying to look for the
smallest value of f that will

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.040
actually be realized on the
hyperbola.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.206
When does that happen?
Well, I have to backtrack a

00:07:20.206 --> 00:07:23.620
little bit.
It seems like the limiting case

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.681
is basically here.
It is when the circle is

00:07:26.681 --> 00:07:31.792
tangent to the hyperbola.
That is the smallest circle

00:07:31.792 --> 00:07:37.111
that will hit the hyperbola.
If I take a larger value of f,

00:07:37.111 --> 00:07:39.878
I will have solutions.
If I take a smaller value of f,

00:07:39.878 --> 00:07:41.940
I will not have any solutions
anymore.

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:49.460
So, that is the situation that
we want to solve for.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:54.365
How do we find that minimum?
Well, a key observation that is

00:07:54.365 --> 00:07:58.250
valid on this picture,
and that actually remain true

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:03.724
in the completely general case,
is that when we have a minimum

00:08:03.724 --> 00:08:09.790
the level curve of f is actually
tangent to our hyperbola.

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:15.871
It is tangent to the set of
points where x,

00:08:15.871 --> 00:08:20.940
y equals three,
to the hyperbola.

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:32.621
Let's write that down.
We observe that at the minimum

00:08:32.621 --> 00:08:49.590
the level curve of f is tangent
to the hyperbola.

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:53.511
Remember, the hyperbola is
given by the equal g equals

00:08:53.511 --> 00:08:56.250
three, so it is a level curve of
g.

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.487
We have a level curve of f and
a level curve of g that are

00:08:59.487 --> 00:09:03.368
tangent to each other.
And I claim that is going to be

00:09:03.368 --> 00:09:07.350
the general situation that we
are interested in.

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:12.070
How do we try to solve for
points where this happens?

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:36.650
How do we find x,
y where the level curves of f

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:47.769
and g are tangent to each other?
Let's think for a second.

00:09:47.769 --> 00:09:51.906
If the two level curves are
tangent to each other that means

00:09:51.906 --> 00:09:57.722
they have the same tangent line.
That means that the normal

00:09:57.722 --> 00:10:03.220
vectors should be parallel.
Let me maybe draw a picture

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:06.745
here.
This is the level curve maybe f

00:10:06.745 --> 00:10:11.989
equals something.
And this is the level curve g

00:10:11.989 --> 00:10:16.000
equals constant.
Here my constant is three.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.511
Well, if I look for gradient
vectors, the gradient of f will

00:10:20.511 --> 00:10:23.799
be perpendicular to the level
curve of f.

00:10:23.799 --> 00:10:27.718
The gradient of g will be
perpendicular to the level curve

00:10:27.718 --> 00:10:29.739
of g.
They don't have any reason to

00:10:29.739 --> 00:10:32.446
be of the same size,
but they have to be parallel to

00:10:32.446 --> 00:10:35.420
each other.
Of course, they could also be

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:38.649
parallel pointing in opposite
directions.

00:10:38.649 --> 00:10:48.559
But the key point is that when
this happens the gradient of f

00:10:48.559 --> 00:10:54.340
is parallel to the gradient of
g.

00:10:54.340 --> 00:11:03.470
Well, let's check that.
Here is a point.

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:05.910
And I can plot the gradient of
f in blue.

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:08.934
The gradient of g in yellow.
And you see,

00:11:08.934 --> 00:11:12.355
in most of these places,
somehow the two gradients are

00:11:12.355 --> 00:11:14.820
not really parallel.
Actually, I should not be

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.271
looking at random points.
I should be looking only on the

00:11:17.271 --> 00:11:19.893
hyperbola.
I want points on the hyperbola

00:11:19.893 --> 00:11:22.570
where the two gradients are
parallel.

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:28.109
Well, when does that happen?
Well, it looks like it will

00:11:28.109 --> 00:11:31.612
happen here.
When I am at a minimum,

00:11:31.612 --> 00:11:34.500
the two gradient vectors are
parallel.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.866
It is not really proof.
It is an example that seems to

00:11:37.866 --> 00:11:43.769
be convincing.
So far things work pretty well.

00:11:43.769 --> 00:11:46.279
How do we decide if two vectors
are parallel?

00:11:46.279 --> 00:11:50.147
Well, they are parallel when
they are proportional to each

00:11:50.147 --> 00:11:54.642
other.
You can write one of them as a

00:11:54.642 --> 00:12:02.283
constant times the other one,
and that constant usually one

00:12:02.283 --> 00:12:07.870
uses the Greek letter lambda.
I don't know if you have seen

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:10.730
it before.
It is the Greek letter for L.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:15.788
And probably,
I am sure, it is somebody's

00:12:15.788 --> 00:12:22.365
idea of paying tribute to
Lagrange by putting an L in

00:12:22.365 --> 00:12:25.730
there.
Lambda is just a constant.

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:31.053
And we are looking for a scalar
lambda and points x and y where

00:12:31.053 --> 00:12:33.809
this holds.
In fact, 

00:12:33.809 --> 00:12:37.704
what we are doing is replacing
min/max problems in two

00:12:37.704 --> 00:12:41.452
variables with a constraint
between them by a set of

00:12:41.452 --> 00:12:47.879
equations involving,
you will see, three variables.

00:12:47.879 --> 00:12:54.017
We had min/max with two
variables x, y,

00:12:54.017 --> 00:13:00.626
but no independent.
We had a constraint g of x,

00:13:00.626 --> 00:13:06.840
y equals constant.
And that becomes something new.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:12.676
That becomes a system of
equations where we have to

00:13:12.676 --> 00:13:19.680
solve, well, let's write down
what it means for gradient f to

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:26.953
be proportional to gradient g.
That means that f sub x should

00:13:26.953 --> 00:13:32.678
be lambda times g sub x,
and f sub y should be lambda

00:13:32.678 --> 00:13:36.834
times g sub y.
Because the gradient vectors

00:13:36.834 --> 00:13:39.852
here are f sub x,
f sub y and g sub x,

00:13:39.852 --> 00:13:43.697
g sub y.
If you have a third variable z

00:13:43.697 --> 00:13:49.790
then you have also an equation f
sub z equals lambda g sub z.

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:53.159
Now, let's see.
How many unknowns do we have in

00:13:53.159 --> 00:13:55.828
these equations?
Well, there is x,

00:13:55.828 --> 00:14:01.545
there is y and there is lambda.
We have three unknowns and have

00:14:01.545 --> 00:14:06.500
only two equations.
Something is missing.

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:10.190
Well, I mean x and y are not
actually independent.

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:14.789
They are related by the
equation g of x,

00:14:14.789 --> 00:14:21.629
y equals c, so we need to add
the constraint g equals c.

00:14:21.629 --> 00:14:26.980
And now we have three equations
involving three variables.

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:39.258
Let's see how that works.
Here remember we have f equals

00:14:39.258 --> 00:14:45.279
x squared y squared and g = xy.
What is f sub x?

00:14:45.279 --> 00:14:52.237
It is going to be 2x equals
lambda times,

00:14:52.237 --> 00:14:55.889
what is g sub x,
y.

00:14:55.889 --> 00:14:59.700
Maybe I should write here f sub
x equals lambda g sub x just to

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:03.664
remind you.
Then we have f sub y equals

00:15:03.664 --> 00:15:10.635
lambda g sub y.
F sub y is 2y equals lambda

00:15:10.635 --> 00:15:18.226
times g sub y is x.
And then our third equation g

00:15:18.226 --> 00:15:22.700
equals c becomes xy equals
three.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:26.640
So, that is what you would have
to solve.

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:33.870
Any questions at this point?
No.

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:44.121
Yes?
How do I know the direction of

00:15:44.121 --> 00:15:47.160
a gradient?
Do you mean how do I know that

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.289
it is perpendicular to a level
curve?

00:15:50.289 --> 00:15:54.077
Oh, how do I know if it points
in that direction on the

00:15:54.077 --> 00:15:56.570
opposite one?
Well, that depends.

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:59.208
I mean we'd seen in last time,
but the gradient is

00:15:59.208 --> 00:16:02.492
perpendicular to the level and
points towards higher values of

00:16:02.492 --> 00:16:05.950
a function.
So it could be -- Wait.

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:08.590
What did I have?
It could be that my gradient

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:11.690
vectors up there actually point
in opposite directions.

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:15.187
It doesn't matter to me because
it will still look the same in

00:16:15.187 --> 00:16:18.226
terms of the equation,
just lambda will be positive or

00:16:18.226 --> 00:16:22.490
negative, depending on the case.
I can handle both situations.

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:30.663
It's not a problem.
I can allow lambda to be

00:16:30.663 --> 00:16:34.125
positive or negative.
Well, in this example,

00:16:34.125 --> 00:16:35.659
it looks like lambda will be
positive.

00:16:35.659 --> 00:16:38.700
If you look at the picture on
the plot.

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:48.296
Yes?
Well, because actually they are

00:16:48.296 --> 00:16:51.795
not equal to each other.
If you look at this point where

00:16:51.795 --> 00:16:55.229
the hyperbola and the circle
touch each other,

00:16:55.229 --> 00:16:58.511
first of all,
I don't know which circle I am

00:16:58.511 --> 00:17:01.563
going to look at.
I am trying to solve,

00:17:01.563 --> 00:17:04.180
actually, for the radius of the
circle.

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.930
I am trying to find what the
minimum value of f is.

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:10.163
And, second,
at that point,

00:17:10.163 --> 00:17:14.460
the value of f and the value of
g are not equal.

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:17.373
g is equal to three because I
want the hyperbola x equals

00:17:17.373 --> 00:17:19.743
three.
The value of f will be the

00:17:19.743 --> 00:17:22.750
square of a distance,
whatever that is.

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:27.140
I think it will end up being 6,
but we will see.

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:29.653
So, you cannot really set them
equal because you don't know

00:17:29.653 --> 00:17:45.870
what f is equal to in advance.
Yes?

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:49.854
Not quite.
Actually, here I am just using

00:17:49.854 --> 00:17:52.738
this idea of finding a point
closest to the origin to

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:55.289
illustrate an example of a
min/max problem.

00:17:55.289 --> 00:17:59.446
The general problem we are
trying to solve is minimize f

00:17:59.446 --> 00:18:03.548
subject to g equals constant.
And what we are going to do for

00:18:03.548 --> 00:18:07.066
that is we are really going to
say instead let's look at places

00:18:07.066 --> 00:18:10.527
where gradient f and gradient g
are parallel to each other and

00:18:10.527 --> 00:18:14.630
solve for equations of that.
I think we completely lose the

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:19.089
notion of closest point if we
just look at these equations.

00:18:19.089 --> 00:18:21.890
We don't really say anything
about closest points anymore.

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:24.380
Of course, that is what they
mean in the end.

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:28.642
But, in the general setting,
there is no closest point

00:18:28.642 --> 00:18:31.160
involved anymore.
OK.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:40.664
Yes?
Yes.

00:18:40.664 --> 00:18:43.480
It is always going to be the
case that,

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:46.978
at the minimum, 
or at the maximum of a function

00:18:46.978 --> 00:18:49.901
subject to a constraint,
the level curves of f and the

00:18:49.901 --> 00:18:52.150
level curves of g will be
tangent to each other.

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:54.140
That is the basis for this
method.

00:18:54.140 --> 00:19:00.089
I am going to justify that soon.
It could be minimum or maximum.

00:19:00.089 --> 00:19:02.430
In three-dimensions it could
even be a saddle point.

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:03.948
And, in fact,
I should say in advance,

00:19:03.948 --> 00:19:06.247
this method will not tell us
whether it is a minimum or a

00:19:06.247 --> 00:19:08.092
maximum.
We do not have any way of

00:19:08.092 --> 00:19:10.039
knowing, except for testing
values.

00:19:10.039 --> 00:19:13.580
We cannot use second derivative
tests or anything like that.

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:21.160
I will get back to that.
Yes?

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.026
Yes.
Here you can set y equals to

00:19:23.026 --> 00:19:26.372
favor x.
Then you can minimize x squared

00:19:26.372 --> 00:19:30.423
plus nine over x squared.
In general, if I am trying to

00:19:30.423 --> 00:19:33.711
solve a more complicated
problem, I might not be able to

00:19:33.711 --> 00:19:35.699
solve.
I am doing an example where,

00:19:35.699 --> 00:19:38.391
indeed, here you could solve
and remove one variable,

00:19:38.391 --> 00:19:41.590
but you cannot always do that.
And this method will still work.

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:47.930
The other one won't.
OK.

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:53.360
I don't see any other questions.
Are there any other questions?

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:56.150
No.
OK.

00:19:56.150 --> 00:20:02.504
I see a lot of students
stretching and so on,

00:20:02.504 --> 00:20:08.720
so it is very confusing for me.
How do we solve these equations?

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:14.400
Well, the answer is in general
we might be in deep trouble.

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:18.007
There is no general method for
solving the equations that you

00:20:18.007 --> 00:20:21.984
get from this method.
You just have to think about

00:20:21.984 --> 00:20:25.240
them.
Sometimes it will be very easy.

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:28.426
Sometimes it will be so hard
that you cannot actually do it

00:20:28.426 --> 00:20:31.019
without the computer.
Sometimes it will be just hard

00:20:31.019 --> 00:20:33.280
enough to be on Part B of this
week's problem set.

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:56.721
I claim in this case we can
actually do it without so much

00:20:56.721 --> 00:21:03.240
trouble, because actually we can
think of this as a two by two

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:10.519
linear system in x and y.
Well, let me do something.

00:21:10.519 --> 00:21:18.150
Let me rewrite the first two
equations as 2x - lambda y = 0.

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:30.630
And lambda x - 2y = 0.
And xy = 3.

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:36.612
That is what we want to solve.
Well, I can put this into

00:21:36.612 --> 00:21:41.732
matrix form.
Two minus lambda,

00:21:41.732 --> 00:21:48.490
lambda minus two times x,
y equals 0,0.

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:52.126
Now, how do I solve a linear
system matrix times x,

00:21:52.126 --> 00:21:54.677
y equals zero?
Well, I always have an obvious

00:21:54.677 --> 00:21:56.940
solution.
X and y both equal to zero.

00:21:56.940 --> 00:22:02.115
Is that a good solution?
No, because zero times zero is

00:22:02.115 --> 00:22:07.676
not three.
We want another solution,

00:22:07.676 --> 00:22:14.230
the trivial solution.
0,0 does not solve the

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:20.906
constraint equation xy equals
three, so we want another

00:22:20.906 --> 00:22:24.125
solution.
When do we have another

00:22:24.125 --> 00:22:29.952
solution?
Well, when the determinant of a

00:22:29.952 --> 00:22:37.766
matrix is zero.
We have other solutions that

00:22:37.766 --> 00:22:46.490
exist only if determinant of a
matrix is zero.

00:22:46.490 --> 00:23:01.410
M is this guy.
Let's compute the determinant.

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:08.339
Well, that seems to be negative
four plus lambda squared.

00:23:08.339 --> 00:23:15.454
That is zero exactly when
lambda squared equals four,

00:23:15.454 --> 00:23:20.789
which is lambda is plus or
minus two.

00:23:20.789 --> 00:23:25.324
Already you see here it is a
the level of difficulty that is

00:23:25.324 --> 00:23:30.013
a little bit much for an exam
but perfectly fine for a problem

00:23:30.013 --> 00:23:33.779
set or for a beautiful lecture
like this one.

00:23:33.779 --> 00:23:37.349
How do we deal with -- Well,
we have two cases to look at.

00:23:37.349 --> 00:23:40.839
Lambda equals two or lambda
equals minus two.

00:23:40.839 --> 00:23:43.079
Let's start with lambda equals
two.

00:23:43.079 --> 00:23:47.680
If I set lambda equals two,
what does this equation become?

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:53.910
Well, it becomes x equals y.
This one becomes y equals x.

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:57.299
Well, they seem to be the same.
x equals y.

00:23:57.299 --> 00:24:01.527
And then the equation xy equals
three becomes,

00:24:01.527 --> 00:24:06.829
well, x squared equals three.
I have two solutions.

00:24:06.829 --> 00:24:15.190
One is x equals root three and,
therefore, y equals root three

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:23.140
as well, or negative root three
and negative root three.

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:26.911
Let's look at the other case.
If I set lambda equal to

00:24:26.911 --> 00:24:30.890
negative two then I get 2x
equals negative 2y.

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:37.058
That means x equals negative y.
The second one,

00:24:37.058 --> 00:24:40.920
2y equals negative 2x.
That is y equals negative x.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:45.975
Well, that is the same thing.
And xy equals three becomes

00:24:45.975 --> 00:24:51.540
negative x squared equals three.
Can we solve that?

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:58.279
No.
There are no solutions here.

00:24:58.279 --> 00:25:03.164
Now we have two candidate
points which are these two

00:25:03.164 --> 00:25:07.570
points, root three,
root three or negative root

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:13.769
three, negative root three.
OK.

00:25:13.769 --> 00:25:16.369
Let's actually look at what we
have here.

00:25:16.369 --> 00:25:20.295
Maybe you cannot read the
coordinates, but the point that

00:25:20.295 --> 00:25:23.589
I have here is indeed root
three, root three.

00:25:23.589 --> 00:25:26.690
How do we see that lambda
equals two?

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:29.764
Well, if you look at this
picture, the gradient of f,

00:25:29.764 --> 00:25:32.720
that is the blue vector,
is indeed twice the yellow

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:36.583
vector, gradient g.
That is where you read the

00:25:36.583 --> 00:25:41.869
value of lambda.
And we have the other solution

00:25:41.869 --> 00:25:45.953
which is somewhere here.
Negative root three,

00:25:45.953 --> 00:25:48.485
negative root there.
And there, again,

00:25:48.485 --> 00:25:51.602
lambda equals two.
The two vectors are

00:25:51.602 --> 00:25:59.019
proportional by a factor of two.
Yes?

00:25:59.019 --> 00:26:01.704
No, solutions are not quite
guaranteed to be absolute minima

00:26:01.704 --> 00:26:03.817
or maxima.
They are guaranteed to be

00:26:03.817 --> 00:26:06.640
somehow critical points end of a
constraint.

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:09.387
That means if you were able to
solve and eliminate the variable

00:26:09.387 --> 00:26:12.252
that would be a critical point.
When you have the same problem,

00:26:12.252 --> 00:26:14.740
as we have critical points,
are they maxima or minima?

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:22.014
And the answer is,
well, we won't know until we

00:26:22.014 --> 00:26:28.910
check.
More questions?

00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:32.900
No.
Yes?

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:36.428
What is a Lagrange multiplier?
Well, it is this number lambda

00:26:36.428 --> 00:26:39.089
that is called the multiplier
here.

00:26:39.089 --> 00:26:44.613
It is a multiplier because it
is what you have to multiply

00:26:44.613 --> 00:26:48.490
gradient of g by to get gradient
of f.

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:49.290
It multiplies.

00:27:04.029 --> 00:27:11.319
Let's try to see why is this
method valid?

00:27:11.319 --> 00:27:18.882
Because so far I have shown you
pictures and have said see they

00:27:18.882 --> 00:27:23.598
are tangent.
But why is it that they have to

00:27:23.598 --> 00:27:28.380
be tangent in general?
Let's think about it.

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:37.750
Let's say that we are at
constrained min or max.

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:42.100
What that means is that if I
move on the level g equals

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:46.612
constant then the value of f
should only increase or only

00:27:46.612 --> 00:27:49.110
decrease.
But it means,

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:53.574
in particular,
to first order it will not

00:27:53.574 --> 00:27:56.468
change.
At an unconstrained min or max,

00:27:56.468 --> 00:27:59.019
partial derivatives are zero.
In this case,

00:27:59.019 --> 00:28:02.400
derivatives are zero only in
the allowed directions.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:09.362
And the allowed directions are
those that stay on the levels of

00:28:09.362 --> 00:28:21.400
this g equals constant.
In any direction along the

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:40.569
level set g = c the rate of
change of f must be zero.

00:28:40.569 --> 00:28:44.559
That is what happens at minima
or maxima.

00:28:44.559 --> 00:28:49.806
Except here,
of course, we look only at the

00:28:49.806 --> 00:28:54.466
allowed directions.
Let's say the same thing in

00:28:54.466 --> 00:28:57.030
terms of directional
derivatives.

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:35.751
That means for any direction
that is tangent to the

00:29:35.751 --> 00:29:49.832
constraint level g equal c,
we must have df over ds in the

00:29:49.832 --> 00:30:00.039
direction of u equals zero.
I will draw a picture.

00:30:00.039 --> 00:30:05.003
Let's say now I am in three
variables just to give you

00:30:05.003 --> 00:30:09.676
different examples.
Here I have a level surface g

00:30:09.676 --> 00:30:11.900
equals c.
I am at my point.

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:18.140
And if I move in any direction
that is on the level surface,

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:24.019
so I move in the direction u
tangent to the level surface,

00:30:24.019 --> 00:30:32.509
then the rate of change of f in
that direction should be zero.

00:30:32.509 --> 00:30:34.750
Now, remember what the formula
is for this guy.

00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:44.029
Well, we have seen that this
guy is actually radiant f dot u.

00:30:44.029 --> 00:30:58.753
That means any such vector u
must be perpendicular to the

00:30:58.753 --> 00:31:05.430
gradient of f.
That means that the gradient of

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:10.212
f should be perpendicular to
anything that is tangent to this

00:31:10.212 --> 00:31:12.973
level.
That means the gradient of f

00:31:12.973 --> 00:31:16.040
should be perpendicular to the
level set.

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.190
That is what we have shown.

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:40.383
But we know another vector that
is also perpendicular to the

00:31:40.383 --> 00:31:57.029
level set of g.
That is the gradient of g.

00:31:57.029 --> 00:32:02.123
We conclude that the gradient
of f must be parallel to the

00:32:02.123 --> 00:32:07.485
gradient of g because both are
perpendicular to the level set

00:32:07.485 --> 00:32:09.602
of g.
I see confused faces,

00:32:09.602 --> 00:32:13.039
so let me try to tell you again
where that comes from.

00:32:13.039 --> 00:32:16.078
We said if we had a constrained
minimum or maximum,

00:32:16.078 --> 00:32:19.299
if we move in the level set of
g, f doesn't change.

00:32:19.299 --> 00:32:20.799
Well, it doesn't change to
first order.

00:32:20.799 --> 00:32:24.589
It is the same idea as when you
are looking for a minimum you

00:32:24.589 --> 00:32:26.799
set the derivative equal to
zero.

00:32:26.799 --> 00:32:31.212
So the derivative in any
direction, tangent to g equals

00:32:31.212 --> 00:32:34.807
c, should be the directional
derivative of f,

00:32:34.807 --> 00:32:38.240
in any such direction,
should be zero.

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:43.480
That is what we mean by
critical point of f.

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:48.813
And so that means that any
vector u, any unit vector

00:32:48.813 --> 00:32:55.507
tangent to the level set of g is
going to be perpendicular to the

00:32:55.507 --> 00:33:00.532
gradient of f.
That means that the gradient of

00:33:00.532 --> 00:33:04.789
f is perpendicular to the level
set of g.

00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:06.751
If you want,
that means the level sets of f

00:33:06.751 --> 00:33:10.956
and g are tangent to each other.
That is justifying what we have

00:33:10.956 --> 00:33:15.768
observed in the picture that the
two level sets have to be

00:33:15.768 --> 00:33:20.579
tangent to each other at the
prime minimum or maximum.

00:33:20.579 --> 00:33:23.780
Does that make a little bit of
sense?

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:28.135
Kind of.
I see at least a few faces

00:33:28.135 --> 00:33:35.769
nodding so I take that to be a
positive answer.

00:33:35.769 --> 00:33:39.100
Since I have been asked by
several of you,

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:43.000
how do I know if it is a
maximum or a minimum?

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:57.078
Well, warning,
the method doesn't tell whether

00:33:57.078 --> 00:34:09.280
a solution is a minimum or a
maximum.

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:13.320
How do we do it?
Well, more bad news.

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:26.590
We cannot use the second
derivative test.

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:30.456
And the reason for that is that
we care actually only about

00:34:30.456 --> 00:34:34.590
these specific directions that
are tangent to variable of g.

00:34:34.590 --> 00:34:39.158
And we don't want to bother to
try to define directional second

00:34:39.158 --> 00:34:42.110
derivatives.
Not to mention that actually it

00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:45.106
wouldn't work.
There is a criterion but it is

00:34:45.106 --> 00:34:49.329
much more complicated than that.
Basically, the answer for us is

00:34:49.329 --> 00:34:52.472
that we don't have a second
derivative test in this

00:34:52.472 --> 00:34:54.489
situation.
What are we left with?

00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:57.079
Well, we are just left with
comparing values.

00:34:57.079 --> 00:35:00.421
Say that in this problem you
found a point where f equals

00:35:00.421 --> 00:35:04.239
three, a point where f equals
nine, a point where f equals 15.

00:35:04.239 --> 00:35:08.359
Well, then probably the minimum
is the point where f equals

00:35:08.359 --> 00:35:12.546
three and the maximum is 15.
Actually, in this case,

00:35:12.546 --> 00:35:17.106
where we found minima,
these two points are tied for

00:35:17.106 --> 00:35:19.130
minimum.
What about the maximum?

00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:22.519
What is the maximum of f on the
hyperbola?

00:35:22.519 --> 00:35:25.778
Well, it is infinity because
the point can go as far as you

00:35:25.778 --> 00:35:29.755
want from the origin.
But the general idea is if we

00:35:29.755 --> 00:35:35.590
have a good reason to believe
that there should be a minimum,

00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:38.739
and it's not like at infinity
or something weird like that,

00:35:38.739 --> 00:35:42.198
then the minimum will be a
solution of the Lagrange

00:35:42.198 --> 00:35:46.094
multiplier equations.
We just look for all the

00:35:46.094 --> 00:35:51.855
solutions and then we choose the
one that gives us the lowest

00:35:51.855 --> 00:35:55.340
value.
Is that good enough?

00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:57.320
Let me actually write that down.

00:36:23.739 --> 00:36:35.672
To find the minimum or the
maximum, we compare values of f

00:36:35.672 --> 00:36:46.559
at the various solutions -- --
to Lagrange multiplier

00:36:46.559 --> 00:36:49.490
equations.

00:37:08.929 --> 00:37:11.835
I should say also that
sometimes you can just conclude

00:37:11.835 --> 00:37:14.384
by thinking geometrically.
In this case,

00:37:14.384 --> 00:37:18.831
when it is asking you which
point is closest to the origin

00:37:18.831 --> 00:37:23.200
you can just see that your
answer is the correct one.

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:32.728
Let's do an advanced example.
Advanced means that -- Well,

00:37:32.728 --> 00:37:37.937
this one I didn't actually dare
to put on top of the other

00:37:37.937 --> 00:37:48.070
problem sets.
Instead, I am going to do it.

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:51.800
What is this going to be about?
We are going to look for a

00:37:51.800 --> 00:38:03.915
surface minimizing pyramid.
Let's say that we want to build

00:38:03.915 --> 00:38:19.335
a pyramid with a given
triangular base -- -- and a

00:38:19.335 --> 00:38:28.431
given volume.
Say that I have maybe in the x,

00:38:28.431 --> 00:38:33.539
y plane I am giving you some
triangle.

00:38:33.539 --> 00:38:40.579
And I am going to try to build
a pyramid.

00:38:40.579 --> 00:38:48.219
Of course, I can choose where
to put the top of a pyramid.

00:38:48.219 --> 00:38:53.050
This guy will end up being
behind now.

00:38:53.050 --> 00:39:09.844
And the constraint and the goal
is to minimize the total surface

00:39:09.844 --> 00:39:13.013
area.
The first time I taught this

00:39:13.013 --> 00:39:15.805
class, it was a few years ago,
was just before they built the

00:39:15.805 --> 00:39:17.871
Stata Center.
And then I used to motivate

00:39:17.871 --> 00:39:20.610
this problem by saying Frank
Gehry has gone crazy and has

00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:23.840
been given a triangular plot of
land he wants to put a pyramid.

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:26.199
There needs to be the right
amount of volume so that you can

00:39:26.199 --> 00:39:28.920
put all the offices in there.
And he wants it to be,

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:31.139
actually, covered in solid
gold.

00:39:31.139 --> 00:39:34.506
And because that is expensive,
the administration wants him to

00:39:34.506 --> 00:39:38.611
cut the costs a bit.
And so you have to minimize the

00:39:38.611 --> 00:39:42.809
total size so that it doesn't
cost too much.

00:39:42.809 --> 00:39:45.277
We will see if MIT comes up
with a triangular pyramid

00:39:45.277 --> 00:39:48.190
building.
Hopefully not.

00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:58.929
It could be our next dorm,
you never know.

00:39:58.929 --> 00:40:01.969
Anyway, it is a fine geometry
problem.

00:40:01.969 --> 00:40:07.550
Let's try to think about how we
can do this.

00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:10.079
The natural way to think about
it would be -- Well,

00:40:10.079 --> 00:40:11.900
what do we have to look for
first?

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:18.230
We have to look for the
position of that top point.

00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:29.181
Remember we know that the
volume of a pyramid is one-third

00:40:29.181 --> 00:40:37.016
the area of base times height.
In fact, fixing the volume,

00:40:37.016 --> 00:40:39.827
knowing that we have fixed the
area of a base,

00:40:39.827 --> 00:40:43.200
means that we are fixing the
height of the pyramid.

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:47.485
The height is completely fixed.
What we have to choose just is

00:40:47.485 --> 00:40:52.282
where do we put that top point?
Do we put it smack in the

00:40:52.282 --> 00:40:58.050
middle of a triangle or to a
side or even anywhere we want?

00:40:58.050 --> 00:41:15.219
Its z coordinate is fixed.
Let's call h the height.

00:41:15.219 --> 00:41:20.960
What we could do is something
like this.

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:24.599
We say we have three points of
a base.

00:41:24.599 --> 00:41:32.009
Let's call them p1 at (x1,
y1,0); p2 at (x2,

00:41:32.009 --> 00:41:36.489
y2,0); p3 at (x3,
y3,0).

00:41:36.489 --> 00:41:40.010
This point p is the unknown
point at (x, y,

00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:42.820
h).
We know the height.

00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:46.802
And then we want to minimize
the sum of the areas of these

00:41:46.802 --> 00:41:50.803
three triangles.
One here, one here and one at

00:41:50.803 --> 00:41:53.982
the back.
And areas of triangles we know

00:41:53.982 --> 00:41:57.630
how to express by using length
of cross-product.

00:41:57.630 --> 00:42:00.380
It becomes a function of x and
y.

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:04.019
And you can try to minimize it.
Actually, it doesn't quite work.

00:42:04.019 --> 00:42:05.520
The formulas are just too
complicated.

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:14.934
You will never get there.
What happens is actually maybe

00:42:14.934 --> 00:42:18.780
we need better coordinates.
Why do we need better

00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:21.415
coordinates?
That is because the geometry is

00:42:21.415 --> 00:42:24.809
kind of difficult to do if you
use x, y coordinates.

00:42:24.809 --> 00:42:28.500
I mean formula for
cross-product is fine,

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:33.850
but then the length of the
vector will be annoying and just

00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:37.502
doesn't look good.
Instead, let's think about it

00:42:37.502 --> 00:42:38.230
differently.

00:42:54.449 --> 00:43:01.557
I claim if we do it this way
and we express the area as a

00:43:01.557 --> 00:43:06.634
function of x,
y, well, actually we can't

00:43:06.634 --> 00:43:13.469
solve for a minimum.
Here is another way to do it.

00:43:13.469 --> 00:43:17.296
Well, what has worked pretty
well for us so far is this

00:43:17.296 --> 00:43:19.989
geometric idea of base times
height.

00:43:19.989 --> 00:43:29.670
So let's think in terms of the
heights of side triangles.

00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:37.949
I am going to use the height of
these things.

00:43:37.949 --> 00:43:43.689
And I am going to say that the
area will be the sum of three

00:43:43.689 --> 00:43:48.650
terms, which are three bases
times three heights.

00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:53.579
Let's give names to these
quantities.

00:43:53.579 --> 00:43:58.196
Actually, for that it is going
to be good to have the point in

00:43:58.196 --> 00:44:01.450
the xy plane that lives directly
below p.

00:44:01.450 --> 00:44:08.359
Let's call it q.
P is the point that coordinates

00:44:08.359 --> 00:44:13.522
x, y, h.
And let's call q the point that

00:44:13.522 --> 00:44:19.260
is just below it and so it'
coordinates are x,

00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:22.230
y, 0.
Let's see.

00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:34.396
Let me draw a map of this thing.
p1, p2, p3 and I have my point

00:44:34.396 --> 00:44:37.940
q in the middle.
Let's see.

00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:40.130
To know these areas,
I need to know the base.

00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:44.662
Well, the base I can decide
that I know it because it is

00:44:44.662 --> 00:44:48.750
part of my given data.
I know the sides of this

00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:53.865
triangle.
Let me call the lengths a1,

00:44:53.865 --> 00:44:56.950
a2, a3.
I also need to know the height,

00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:58.900
so I need to know these
lengths.

00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:01.693
How do I know these lengths?
Well, its distance in space,

00:45:01.693 --> 00:45:03.690
but it is a little bit
annoying.

00:45:03.690 --> 00:45:10.213
But maybe I can reduce it to a
distance in the plane by looking

00:45:10.213 --> 00:45:17.070
instead at this distance here.
Let me give names to the

00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:24.972
distances from q to the sides.
Let's call u1,

00:45:24.972 --> 00:45:35.150
u2, u3 the distances from q to
the sides.

00:45:47.389 --> 00:45:49.750
Well, now I can claim I can
find, actually,

00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:53.440
sorry.
I need to draw one more thing.

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:57.088
I claim I have a nice formula
for the area,

00:45:57.088 --> 00:46:01.780
because this is vertical and
this is horizontal so this

00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:05.690
length here is u3,
this length here is h.

00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:13.194
So what is this length here?
It is the square root of u3

00:46:13.194 --> 00:46:17.898
squared plus h squared.
And similarly for these other

00:46:17.898 --> 00:46:23.096
guys.
They are square roots of a u

00:46:23.096 --> 00:46:31.088
squared plus h squared.
The heights of the faces are

00:46:31.088 --> 00:46:36.890
square root of u1 squared times
h squared.

00:46:36.890 --> 00:46:43.541
And similarly with u2 and u3.
So the total side area is going

00:46:43.541 --> 00:46:47.330
to be the area of the first
faces,

00:46:47.330 --> 00:46:58.623
one-half of base times height, 
plus one-half of a base times a

00:46:58.623 --> 00:47:06.440
height plus one-half of the
third one.

00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:09.097
It doesn't look so much better.
But, trust me,

00:47:09.097 --> 00:47:15.212
it will get better.
Now, that is a function of

00:47:15.212 --> 00:47:19.710
three variables,
u1, u2, u3.

00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:22.550
And how do we relate u1,
u2, u3 to each other?

00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:25.289
They are probably not
independent.

00:47:25.289 --> 00:47:32.258
Well, let's cut this triangle
here into three pieces like

00:47:32.258 --> 00:47:35.927
that.
Then each piece has side --

00:47:35.927 --> 00:47:40.900
Well, let's look at it the piece
of the bottom.

00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:50.746
It has base a3, height u3.
Cutting base into three tells

00:47:50.746 --> 00:47:57.738
you that the area of a base is
one-half of a1,

00:47:57.738 --> 00:48:04.886
u1 plus one-half of a2,
u2 plus one-half of a3,

00:48:04.886 --> 00:48:09.920
u3.
And that is our constraint.

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:12.639
My three variables,
u1, u2, u3, are constrained in

00:48:12.639 --> 00:48:14.864
this way.
The sum of this figure must be

00:48:14.864 --> 00:48:17.989
the area of a base.
And I want to minimize that guy.

00:48:17.989 --> 00:48:23.030
So that is my g and that guy
here is my f.

00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:28.960
Now we try to apply our
Lagrange multiplier equations.

00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:33.950
Well, partial f of a partial u1
is -- Well,

00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:36.949
if you do the calculation, 
you will see it is one-half a1, 

00:48:36.949 --> 00:48:43.030
u1 over square root of u1^2
plus h^2 equals lambda,

00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:46.050
what is partial g, 
partial a1?

00:48:46.050 --> 00:48:50.090
That one you can do, I am sure.
It is one-half a1.

00:48:50.090 --> 00:49:00.949
Oh, these guys simplify.
If you do the same with the

00:49:00.949 --> 00:49:09.660
second one -- -- things simplify
again.

00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:17.753
And the same with the third one.
Well, you will get,

00:49:17.753 --> 00:49:21.088
after simplifying,
u3 over square root of u3

00:49:21.088 --> 00:49:24.190
squared plus h squared equals
lambda.

00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:27.740
Now, that means this guy equals
this guy equals this guy.

00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:33.373
They are all equal to lambda.
And, if you think about it,

00:49:33.373 --> 00:49:39.313
that means that u1 = u2 = u3.
See, it looked like scary

00:49:39.313 --> 00:49:42.760
equations but the solution is
very simple.

00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:45.031
What does it mean?
It means that our point q

00:49:45.031 --> 00:49:47.550
should be equidistant from all
three sides.

00:49:47.550 --> 00:49:52.539
That is called the incenter.
Q should be in the incenter.

00:49:52.539 --> 00:49:56.243
The next time you have to build
a golden pyramid and don't want

00:49:56.243 --> 00:49:59.290
to go broke, well,
you know where to put the top.

00:49:59.290 --> 00:50:03.016
If that was a bit fast, sorry.
Anyway, it is not completely

00:50:03.016 --> 00:50:06.650
crucial.
But go over it and you will see

00:50:06.650 --> 00:50:08.840
it works.
Have a nice weekend.
