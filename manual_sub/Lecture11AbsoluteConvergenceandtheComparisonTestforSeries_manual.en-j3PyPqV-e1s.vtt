00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.450
CASEY RODRIGUEZ: All
right, so last time we

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.800
proved the following theorem--

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:30.700
that if I have a
convergent series,

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.720
and this implies
that the limit as n

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.765
goes to infinity of
x sub n equals 0.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:49.650
So a natural question is, as a
beginning advanced math class,

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:50.850
does the converse hold?

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.530
Is this a two-way street
or a one-way street?

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:04.489
So if the individual terms in
this series converges to 0,

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.740
does this imply that
the series converges?

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.900
And I'm sure you answered
this question in some form

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.520
in a previous calculus class.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.150
And the answer to
this question is no.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.020
So what's the counterexample?

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.320
It's the so-called
harmonic series,

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.590
which corresponds to our
favorite sequence which

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.760
converges to 0.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.350
So we'll state
this as a theorem--

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:58.170
the series sum from n equals
1 to infinity of 1 over n

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.470
does not converge.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.940
So how are we going
to prove this theorem?

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.640
We'll prove this
theorem by showing

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.350
a sequence of partial sums.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.070
Some sequence of partial sums
for this guy does not converge.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.750
So if it were to converge, then
the sequence of partial sums

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.110
converges, and therefore, every
subsequence of partial sums

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.900
converge.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.460
So what's the strategy?

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:51.979
We're going to show that
there exists a subsequence

00:02:51.979 --> 00:03:00.900
of partial sums, here s n k--

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.050
let's make this m k--

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.750
so remember, the
partial sums are simply

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.420
summing up the first--

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.480
so the index here is m sub
k, so the first m sub k

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:21.828
terms, 1 over n, diverges.

00:03:21.828 --> 00:03:24.120
And this is enough to show
that the full series doesn't

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.230
converge again.

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.730
Because if it did converge,
the sequence of partial sums

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.400
converges, and therefore, every
subsequence of partial sums

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.490
converges.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.910
So if we're able to show there
exists a subsequence which

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.333
diverges, then we're done.

00:03:39.333 --> 00:03:40.750
In fact, what we're
going to do is

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:41.990
something a little bit stronger.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.532
We're going to show
that there exists

00:03:43.532 --> 00:03:48.970
a subsequence of partial
sums which not only diverges

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.500
but is unbounded.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.720
And therefore, the entire
sequence of partial sums

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.500
is unbounded.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.560
So if we're able to show there
exists a subsequence which

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.470
is unbounded, then the entire
sequence of partial sums

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.510
is unbounded, so
it can't converge.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.790
Because remember,
convergent sequences

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.660
imply bounded sequences.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.620
So we're going to look at
when m sub k is dyadic.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.200
And for some reason, I
switched indices from k

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:46.350
to l in my notes, so instead
we're going to go from m sub l.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:55.550
So let l be a natural
number, and we'll

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:03.380
consider the partial sum
corresponding to adding up

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.015
the first 2 to the l terms.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.130
Now, you may ask,
why 2 to the l?

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.110
Why not 3 to the l?

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.270
Well, 4 to the l will be
a subsequence of that,

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:23.070
but 2 to the l is-- you
could do 3 to the l,

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.250
you could do 5 to
the l, but 2 to the l

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.140
is sufficient for our purposes.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.620
So what we're going
to do is we're

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.630
going to take this
partial sum and bound it

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.250
from below by something
which is quite large.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.150
So first off, all of
these partial sums

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.190
are bounded from below by 0.

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.095
They're a sum of
non-negative terms.

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:57.320
So we write s 2 to the l.

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.510
This is equal to
1 plus 1/2 plus--

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.680
and I'm going to put parentheses
around that-- plus 1/3,

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:15.710
plus 1/4, plus 1/5, plus
1/6, plus 1/7, plus 1/8.

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.640
So how I'm grouping these terms
is I'm grouping them according

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:26.330
to whether the denominator
falls between a power of 2

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:36.410
and the next power of
2, and then plus dot,

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:46.250
dot, dot, 2 to the l minus 1
plus 1 plus 1 over 2 to the l.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.108
Now I can write
this partial sum.

00:06:55.108 --> 00:06:56.400
So I've grouped terms this way.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.220
What is this in terms
of precise symbols?

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:09.080
This is 1 plus sum from lambda
equals 1 to l, sum from n

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:19.410
equals 2 to the lambda minus 1
plus 1 2 to the lambda 1 over n

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:19.910
So.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:25.470
These lambdas are now
parameterizing what power of 2

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:25.970
I'm at.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:30.770
So when lambda equals
1, I'm at this block.

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:32.720
When lambda equals
2, I'm at this block,

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.960
and lambda equals l,
I'm at this block.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.550
And then I'm
summing up the terms

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:43.295
that have denominator between
that power and the next of 2.

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:58.530
So I have this, and now I
bound that sum from below.

00:07:58.530 --> 00:07:59.970
Because again,
I'm trying to show

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:06.180
that this subsequence of
partial sums is unbounded.

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.380
So I bound it from below.

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:17.790
I sum from lambda equals
1 to l, sum from n

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:26.890
equals 2 to the lambda minus
1 plus 1, 2 to the lambda.

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:31.500
And now for each of these,
n is between 2 to the--

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.735
so this should be
2 to the lambda.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:42.547
Now for n between these
two numbers, 1 over n

00:08:42.547 --> 00:08:44.130
is always bigger
than or equal to when

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:47.310
I plug in the biggest bound
here, 2 to the lambda.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.340
And now I just have
a sum, so over n,

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:01.810
but there's no n in this term.

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:09.510
So I just add up all the number
of terms in a given block.

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:10.830
And this is equal to--

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:14.470
so first I have 1 over 2 to
the lambda coming from here,

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:20.820
and then sum from n equals 2
to the lambda minus 1 plus 1, 2

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.350
to the lambda times 1.

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:27.430
So again, I'm going
a little slow here.

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:34.890
And this is just
equal to l 1 over 2

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:38.430
to the lambda times
the number of terms

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:42.330
I have here, which is
2 to the lambda minus 2

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:49.470
to the lambda minus 1 plus
1, so this minus this plus 1.

00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:02.770
So this is equal to 1
plus lambda equals 1 to l,

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:04.570
1 over 2 lambda.

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:07.570
And so this 1 cancels
with this one.

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:11.200
And then I have 2 the lambda
minus 1, which I can bring out.

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:16.645
And so this is just 1.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:25.490
And I get 1 plus sum from
lambda equals 1 to l.

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:28.460
And this 2 to the lambda cancels
with this 2 to the lambda,

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:29.730
and I'm left with just a 1/2.

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:39.340
And this is equal to--

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.920
now remember, there's
no sum here in lambda,

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:49.000
so this is just 1 plus l over 2.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.290
So what did we do?

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:58.370
We basically showed that
each of these blocks

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:01.460
is bounded from below by a 1/2.

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:05.420
That's this term that we
get right here in the end.

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:08.720
And we can see this if we just
go through the first three

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.790
terms which I have written here.

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:14.510
So 1/2 is clearly
bounded below by a 1/2.

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:18.800
1/3 plus 1/4 is bounded
below by 1/4 plus 1/4,

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.570
because 1/3 is bigger than that.

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:23.750
So 1/4 plus 1/4 is a 1/2.

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:28.490
If I look at this next
block, that's 1 over 5

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:30.860
is bigger than or
equal to 1 over 8.

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.030
So is 1 over 6.

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:33.110
So is 1 over 7.

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:37.550
So this sum is bigger than
or equal to 1/8 plus 1/8

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:43.423
plus 1/8 plus 1/8, which equals
1/2, plus, and then so on.

00:11:43.423 --> 00:11:45.340
So maybe I should have
said that before I went

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:46.750
into the actual computation.

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:50.680
But in the end, we get that
this subsequence of partial sums

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:51.340
s to the 2l.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.270
So let me just summarize.

00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:04.120
This is bigger than or
equal to l plus 2 over 2.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:13.290
And as l gets very large,
this thing gets very large.

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:19.280
So this implies s to the
2l, this subsequence,

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:24.210
equals 1 to infinity
is unbounded,

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:33.240
which implies that
the full subsequence,

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:40.200
or the full sequence of
partial sums, is unbounded.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:45.585
And therefore, the sequence of
partial sums does not converge.

00:12:45.585 --> 00:12:47.460
And therefore, that
series does not converge.

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:09.820
So we see that the converse
does not hold for that question

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:12.100
or for that theorem.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:18.640
I will just make a very
passing mention to the fact

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:23.680
that there are fields for
which that does hold--

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.737
so not ordered
fields, because again,

00:13:25.737 --> 00:13:27.820
ordered fields with the
least upper bound property

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:30.880
have to be R, and
therefore, we've

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:36.900
just shown that the converse
of that theorem does not hold.

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:44.160
But in fact, if you look at
the so-called p-adic numbers,

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:50.130
they do have this property
that if the sequence of terms

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:52.110
converges to 0, then
the series converges.

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:53.850
But we will never
see p-adic numbers.

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:58.320
I just wanted to do a little
lip service to that fact--

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.380
that there are at
least fields of numbers

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:03.700
that do have this property.

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:13.910
So we had a theorem
about limits of sequences

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:16.910
and how they interact
with algebraic operations.

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:20.810
This naturally implies
a theorem about series.

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:36.650
So let alpha be in
R, and let's suppose

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:39.935
we have two convergent series.

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:59.680
Then if I look at the
series alpha x n plus y n--

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.620
so the terms of my
new series are alpha

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:04.570
times x sub n plus y sub n--

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:05.980
this is a convergent series.

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:32.440
And the sum of this series
is equal to what you expect.

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:35.650
So the sum of the series alpha
x n plus y n is equal to alpha

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:38.695
times the sum of x n's
plus the sum of y n's.

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:47.820
So this theorem follows
essentially kind of immediately

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:49.920
from what we did for sequences.

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:07.560
Partial sums satisfy-- if I
look at sum stopping at m,

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:14.490
alpha x n plus y n, now just by
the linearity of just adding up

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:16.020
finitely many terms--

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:19.110
I'm not going to put something
down below because I really

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:21.660
don't need to--

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:27.540
this is equal to alpha times
the partial sum of x sub n

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:34.420
plus the partial sum
corresponding to y sub n.

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:40.030
And so we're assuming this
sequence of partial sums

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:43.400
converges and this sequence
of partial sums converges.

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:47.300
So therefore, this term on
the right-hand side converges,

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.970
which implies the
left side converges.

00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:09.079
So by the linear properties
of limits, namely

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:16.069
that the limit of the sum
is the sum of the limits.

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:22.290
And multiplication just by
fixed real numbers commutes

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:26.369
with taking limits, so
we get that limit as m

00:17:26.369 --> 00:17:30.150
goes to infinity,
so the partial sum

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:42.405
corresponding to the new
series equals alpha plus--

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:57.618
and that's just alpha
times sum x n plus sum y n.

00:17:57.618 --> 00:17:58.410
And that's the end.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:26.620
So now, remember we had
certain sequences which

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:28.660
we could tell whether
they converge,

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:33.400
a little bit easier than
just an arbitrary sequence.

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.920
A couple of examples of--

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.430
at least one example
of a sequence

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:40.390
we could decide if it
converges kind of easily

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:45.700
is a monotone
increasing sequence.

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:50.380
And we showed that a monotone
increasing sequence converges

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:53.650
if and only if it's bounded.

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:59.290
So we're going to use this to
be able to say something about

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:01.870
series now-- not
sequences, but series--

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:07.300
that have non-negative
terms that I'm adding up.

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:10.120
Because the partial
sums corresponding

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:13.570
to a series that has
non-negative terms

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:17.020
form a monotone
increasing sequence.

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:19.480
And that's not too hard to show.

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:28.360
So this is the
following theorem.

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:35.260
So now, we're going to discuss
a little bit about sequences

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.660
or look at sequences which
have non-negative terms.

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:40.840
So the theorem is
the following--

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:46.440
if for all n a natural number,
x then is bigger than or equal

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:52.060
to 0-- so all these
terms are non-negative--

00:19:52.060 --> 00:20:01.280
then the series
converges if and only

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:05.810
if the sequence of
partial sums s sub m--

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:18.795
is bounded.

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:26.380
And again, the
way we see this is

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:30.770
just that when these
terms are non-negative,

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:32.630
the sequence of partial
sums is monotone.

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:39.360
So here's the proof.

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:40.750
It's quite easy.

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:51.110
So we have for all
n a natural number--

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:57.010
make that m-- if I look at s
sub m plus 1, this is equal to--

00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:00.070
so this is the m
plus 1 partial sum--

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:04.510
from m equals 1 to
m plus 1, x of n,

00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:13.480
this is equal to sum from n
equals m x n plus x n plus 1.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.873
And now the x m plus 1
term is not negative.

00:21:16.873 --> 00:21:18.790
We're assuming all the
terms are non-negative.

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:21.310
So this right-hand side--

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:24.460
this is certainly bigger
than or equal to sum from n

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:30.520
equals 1 to m of x n,
and that equals s m.

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:38.940
So just summarizing for
all natural numbers m,

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:42.570
the s m plus 1 is bigger
than or equal to s m.

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:44.430
If I just keep adding
non-negative things,

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:45.930
the partial sums
are getting bigger.

00:21:50.560 --> 00:22:05.530
So the partial
sums is a monotone.

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:12.450
So maybe I should've stated
this slightly differently just

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:14.070
so that you don't
think this is part

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:15.787
of one of the if and only ifs.

00:22:15.787 --> 00:22:17.370
I mean, this is the
assumption that we

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:19.360
have for this whole statement.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:29.160
Suppose this, so the conclusion
is that this converges if

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:32.280
and only if the sequence
of partial sums is bounded.

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:38.380
So based on the assumption that
all the terms are non-negative,

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:40.480
we see that the
sequence of partial sums

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.860
is monotone increasing.

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:50.710
That's why what we
proved for sequences--

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:53.748
every monotone increasing
sequence converges if

00:22:53.748 --> 00:22:54.790
and only if it's bounded.

00:23:14.557 --> 00:23:15.140
And that's it.

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:32.790
Now, not every series we look
at does have non-negative terms.

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:37.530
But we can always form a
certain series from those terms

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:42.870
to make a new series with
non-negative terms, which

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:46.530
gives us information
about the original series.

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:50.680
What am I going on about?

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:54.130
And look at the convergence
properties of that new series.

00:23:54.130 --> 00:24:01.380
So we have the
following definition--

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:15.911
that a series
converges absolutely,

00:24:15.911 --> 00:24:25.250
or we say we have
absolute convergence,

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:29.690
if the series formed by
taking the absolute values

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:36.880
of these terms, if
this series converges.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:45.100
So what I was trying to
get at before I stated

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:49.420
this definition is that
absolute convergence

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:51.940
implies usual convergence.

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:06.110
If I had this series
converging absolutely,

00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:13.020
then the original
series converges.

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:20.120
Now, before I
prove this theorem,

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.890
let me prove a
little, small theorem.

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:27.110
I can't remember if I gave
it for an assignment or not,

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:30.500
but it's essentially
a triangle inequality

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:32.075
for however many terms you like.

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:38.960
So we'll prove this
theorem in just a minute.

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:42.220
But first, let me prove
the following theorem--

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:54.040
that if m is bigger than or
equal to 2, and x1 up to x m

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:59.830
are in R, then sum
from n equals 1

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:04.450
to m x n, take the
absolute value of this sum,

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:09.370
this is less than or equal
to sum from n equals 1 to m

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:12.110
of the absolute value.

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:15.950
When m equals 2, this
is just the usual form

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:18.330
of the triangle inequality.

00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:19.910
So m equals 2--

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:23.990
this is just saying x1
plus x2 is always less

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:29.930
than or equal to x1 plus x2,
which is just the triangle

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:32.450
inequality.

00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:39.542
But typically how life
works, at least in analysis,

00:26:39.542 --> 00:26:41.250
if you can do it for
two things, then you

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:47.970
can do it for n things or
m things, in this case,

00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:48.870
by induction.

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:51.720
And so that's how we're
going to prove this.

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:55.350
So we'll prove first prove
this triangle inequality

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:56.220
by induction.

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:06.740
Now, in the induction
proofs we've done so far,

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:09.590
little n is our thing
that we're inducting on.

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:17.470
In this statement, m is
the thing, induction on m.

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:22.470
So let's look at the base
case, which is m equals 2.

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:37.090
So then this is just
the triangle inequality

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:41.050
for two real numbers that
we've already proved before--

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:44.410
x1 plus x2 in absolute
value is always

00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:47.080
less than or equal to sum
of x1 plus the sum of x2--

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:49.900
I mean, the sum of
absolute value of x1

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:54.100
and the absolute value of x2.

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:59.350
So the base case is fine.

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:01.530
So now we do the inductive step.

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:09.070
So I'll assume the statement
that I want to prove.

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:11.740
Usually, I use m, but now
I'll go to the next letter

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:13.855
l, going in reverse
alphabetical order.

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:31.070
Suppose if x1, x l in R.

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:33.845
So let's actually, instead of
just restating all that, just--

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.170
I'll just [INAUDIBLE] star.

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:52.510
So suppose star
holds for m equals l.

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:55.450
And now we want
to prove that star

00:28:55.450 --> 00:28:59.380
holds for m equals l plus 1.

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:09.640
Now we want to show star
holds for m equals l plus 1.

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:34.870
Let x1 up to x l
plus 1 be in R. Then

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:43.180
if I look at the sum from
n equals 1 to l plus 1 x n,

00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:51.430
this is equal to sum from n
equals 1 to l x n plus x l

00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:53.290
plus 1 in absolute value.

00:29:55.850 --> 00:30:00.120
By the usual triangle
inequality for two terms,

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:04.630
this is less than or equal
to sum from n equals 1 to l

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:09.950
of x n in absolute value plus
the absolute value of x l

00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:21.120
plus 1 by usual
triangle inequality.

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:24.090
And now this term,
since I'm assuming m

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:30.080
equals l holds, so the
m equals l case says

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:35.060
this is less than or equal
to sum from n equals 1 to l

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:41.570
of x n plus x l plus
1 in absolute value.

00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:49.180
So this is by
inductive hypothesis.

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:59.330
And this is just equal to sum
from n equals 1 to l plus 1

00:30:59.330 --> 00:31:00.980
x n.

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:05.060
so we've proven the case
for now m equals l plus 1.

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:22.690
And that concludes the proof
of this generalized triangle

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:26.545
inequality with arbitrary
number of terms.

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:33.730
So let's get back to
proving this theorem,

00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:38.630
that absolute convergence
implies convergence.

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:42.260
So we'll do that by proving that
absolute convergence implies

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:43.370
that the series is Cauchy.

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:57.090
So proof-- and this
is of the theorem

00:31:57.090 --> 00:31:58.560
just before this
theorem, we proved

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:06.480
that absolute convergence
implies usual convergence.

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:24.870
So we will prove that in
fact, this series is Cauchy,

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:29.490
assuming absolute convergence.

00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:39.270
And from last time, we had
approved the statement,

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:43.680
or at least this followed from
the statement for sequences,

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:48.010
that a Cauchy series converges--

00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:51.670
that a series is Cauchy if
and only if it converges.

00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:59.870
So we have to prove that
the series is Cauchy.

00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:07.610
Remember, this means for
all epsilon positive,

00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:11.270
there exists a
natural number m such

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:15.020
that for all l bigger
than m bigger than

00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:24.710
or equal to M, if I look at the
sum from n equals m plus 1 to l

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:27.515
of x n, this is
less than epsilon.

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:33.000
So let epsilon be positive.

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:42.550
So since we're assuming that
the series is absolutely

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:51.920
convergent, this
implies that this series

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:54.695
with absolute values
here is also Cauchy.

00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:07.770
So that means that there
exists a natural number m sub 0

00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:11.840
such that for all L bigger than
m bigger than or equal to M

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:19.530
sub 0, if I look at the
sum of absolute values

00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:23.949
from m plus 1 to l, this
is less than epsilon.

00:34:23.949 --> 00:34:26.699
Now, this should have an
absolute value on the outside,

00:34:26.699 --> 00:34:28.590
but this is a sum of
non-negative terms,

00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:31.140
so the absolute
value can be removed.

00:34:39.969 --> 00:34:43.730
You can essentially
see where we're

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:46.280
going based on what's
written on the board--

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:48.770
what we want to prove,
and what we know,

00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:52.610
and this triangle inequality.

00:34:52.610 --> 00:35:02.790
So choose M to be M sub 0.

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:15.870
Then if l is bigger than m is
bigger than or equal to M, then

00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:22.410
the absolute value of the
sum m plus 1 to l sub n--

00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:28.410
this is less than or equal
to the sum from n equals

00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:32.700
m plus 1 to l of the
absolute values of x sub n

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:37.990
by the theorem we proved
just a minute ago.

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:41.640
And this is less than
epsilon by our choice of M. M

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:45.190
is equal to M0,
and for M0, we have

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:46.660
this inequality right here.

00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:58.490
Thus the series is Cauchy,
which implies it converges.

00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:20.120
Basically, the
only test you know

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:23.660
for determining when
a series is convergent

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:28.250
is in one of two possibilities.

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:30.960
Either A, it has a
very simple form,

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:33.530
and so all the terms
are non-negative,

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:36.680
but the terms have
a very simple form.

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:38.450
It's the alternating
series test which

00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:46.460
we'll discuss in a little bit,
possibly the next lecture.

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:49.177
And then when a series
converges absolutely,

00:36:49.177 --> 00:36:50.510
we have a lot of tests for that.

00:36:54.840 --> 00:37:00.770
And we'll see that series
which converge absolutely

00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:05.540
somehow are not fickle, meaning
I can rearrange the terms

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:07.910
and the rearranged
series will still

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:10.700
converge absolutely, and
converge to the same thing

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:12.995
that the original
series converged to.

00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:26.530
So let me just make a brief
comment after this theorem,

00:37:26.530 --> 00:37:30.720
we proved that absolute
convergence implies

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:33.420
usual convergence, and
tie-in a little bit

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:34.840
to what I just said there.

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:51.020
So we'll show that
the series sum from 1

00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:55.790
to infinity of minus
1 to the n 1 over n--

00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:56.840
this converges.

00:38:01.330 --> 00:38:13.590
But note that this series
does not converge absolutely.

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:24.540
Because when I take absolute
values, I just get sum of 1

00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:28.230
over n, which is the harmonic
series, which we just showed

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:30.870
a few minutes ago is divergent.

00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:44.235
So now we're going to move
on to some convergence tests.

00:38:57.674 --> 00:39:04.090
Now, when it comes to
convergence tests, what these

00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:06.100
all follow from
is basically what

00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:11.050
we know about geometric series
and the following comparison

00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:13.060
test, although when
I do the proofs

00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:15.670
of the other convergence
tests, I won't actually

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:17.470
state that I'm using
the comparison test.

00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:20.700
But that's kind of what's
really getting used.

00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:30.350
So the first test we have
is the comparison test.

00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:35.460
And the statement
is the following--

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:43.530
suppose for all n
a natural number,

00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:46.470
we're looking at
non-negative terms

00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:47.925
with one smaller than the other.

00:39:51.640 --> 00:40:04.480
Then the conclusion is if
the bigger one converges,

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:06.790
this implies that the
smaller one converges.

00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:21.280
And if the smaller
one diverges, this

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:25.585
implies that the
bigger one diverges.

00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:41.820
How we're going
to prove this is--

00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:44.250
so we're dealing with terms
that are non-negative,

00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:49.920
so we'll use this theorem about
a series of non-negative terms.

00:40:52.748 --> 00:40:54.290
So we use that
theorem, and we proved

00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:57.950
that a series of non-negative
terms converges if

00:40:57.950 --> 00:41:02.355
and only if the sequence
of partial sums is bounded.

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:16.340
So if this series
converges, this

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:28.190
implies that the
sequence of partial sums

00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:32.030
is bounded, which implies--

00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:38.090
that means that there exists
a non-negative number such

00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:47.520
that for all natural numbers
m, sum from n equals 1 to m

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:57.810
of y sub n is less
than or equal to B.

00:41:57.810 --> 00:42:01.430
But this immediately implies
that since all the x n's

00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:03.290
are less than or
equal to the y n's, we

00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:12.920
get that the n-th partial sum
corresponding to the x n's,

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:18.230
which is less than or equal
to the n-th partial sum

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:22.280
for the y n's, is also less
than or equal to B for all m.

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:37.815
So sequence of partial sums
corresponding to the x n's is

00:42:37.815 --> 00:42:38.315
bounded.

00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:44.820
And therefore, by the
theorem we proved,

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:55.390
which I think I have erased
already, the series converges.

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:05.760
Now, proving 2 is essentially--

00:43:10.393 --> 00:43:12.560
it's kind of the same thing,
except the inequalities

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:13.580
go the other way.

00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:16.370
And the x n's are getting
bigger, which implies the y n's

00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:17.480
are also getting--

00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:20.420
or the partial sums
corresponding to the x n's is

00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:23.120
getting bigger implying
that the partial sums

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:25.590
corresponding to the y n's
are also getting bigger.

00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:38.820
So now 2, if this
series diverges,

00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:49.800
then this implies that
partial sums is unbounded.

00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:55.680
we'll now prove
that this implies

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:57.930
that the partial sums
corresponding to the y n's are

00:43:57.930 --> 00:43:58.620
unbounded.

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:18.110
Now, remember what it means
for a sequence to be bounded

00:44:18.110 --> 00:44:23.180
is that there exists a
non-negative number B such

00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:25.040
that for all m I
have that bound.

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:28.370
So to say it's unbounded
means that for all B

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:31.430
there exists a little m bigger
than or equal to capital M

00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:33.965
such that that
inequality is reversed.

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:41.100
So let me put here in a box
what this actually means.

00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:45.450
Again, this means that for all
B bigger than or equal to 0,

00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:48.230
there exists m,
a natural number,

00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:57.760
so that y n equals 1 to m is
bigger than or equal to B.

00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:59.575
That's what this means.

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:04.240
So this is a for
all statement, so I

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:07.720
have to be able to prove it for
every B, that B be bigger than

00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:09.640
or equal to 0.

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:14.680
Now, since we know that the
partial sums corresponding

00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:24.340
to the x n's is
unbounded, this implies

00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:30.310
that there exists an
m, a natural number,

00:45:30.310 --> 00:45:34.210
such that the sum
from n equals 1 to m

00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:40.420
of x n is bigger
than or equal to B.

00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:46.580
So let me say again, to show
its unbounded I should really

00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:47.180
have--

00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:48.890
so for a sequence
to be unbounded,

00:45:48.890 --> 00:45:50.510
I should have an
absolute value here

00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:55.220
is bigger than or equal to
B. But all of these terms

00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:57.650
are non-negative,
and therefore, I

00:45:57.650 --> 00:46:02.780
can remove the absolute values,
and the same thing here.

00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:06.820
So there exists a natural
number m so that I have this.

00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:15.200
And so we put a little m0 there
because we have to somehow show

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:16.503
there exists a little m.

00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:21.760
Choose m to be this m0.

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:29.800
So now, if we look at the
partial sums for the y n's,

00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:33.820
this is bigger
than or equal to--

00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:37.850
because m equals
m0, it's this term,

00:46:37.850 --> 00:46:43.010
which is bigger than
or equal to B. Thus,

00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:52.860
this proves the partial sums
corresponding to the y n

00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:55.380
is unbounded.

00:46:58.050 --> 00:47:01.035
And therefore, this
series diverges.

00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:14.420
So let's use the
comparison theorem

00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:21.920
to consider series
like 1 over n p-series,

00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:25.100
and prove when they do converge.

00:47:29.790 --> 00:47:46.240
So theorem-- for
p, a real number,

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:51.250
sum n equals 1 to
infinity 1 over n to the p

00:47:51.250 --> 00:48:00.060
converges if and only
if p is bigger than 1.

00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:23.800
So for the proof, why
does the series converging

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:27.850
imply p has to be bigger than 1?

00:48:27.850 --> 00:48:29.690
I'll do this by contradiction.

00:48:29.690 --> 00:48:40.760
So suppose 1 over n to the p
equals 1 to infinity converges.

00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:45.190
So we'll do the proof
by contradiction

00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:48.940
that p has to be bigger than 1.

00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:51.550
Suppose p is less
than or equal to 1.

00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:59.280
Then 1 over n to the p--

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:01.270
where p is less
than or equal to 1,

00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:03.880
this is bigger than
or equal to 1 over n.

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:12.970
And this implies,
since 1 over n--

00:49:12.970 --> 00:49:15.670
since the series
corresponding to 1 over n--

00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:19.610
diverges implies that the
series corresponding to 1 over n

00:49:19.610 --> 00:49:39.300
to the p diverges by the
comparison test, which

00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:42.510
is a direct contradiction
to what we're assuming,

00:49:42.510 --> 00:49:45.520
that the series converges.

00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:50.150
So this must be false.

00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:51.320
p must be bigger than 1.

00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:54.978
So we've shown that if
this series converges,

00:49:54.978 --> 00:49:56.270
then p has to be bigger than 1.

00:49:56.270 --> 00:50:03.380
So now let's prove
the other direction

00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:08.600
and suppose p is bigger
than 1, and prove

00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:13.520
that the p series, 1 over
n to the p, converges.

00:50:23.335 --> 00:50:24.710
So the way we're
going to do this

00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:33.270
is kind of how we showed
that the harmonic series is

00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:34.140
divergent.

00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:39.225
So what we're going
to do is first,

00:50:39.225 --> 00:50:40.600
we're going to
show that there is

00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:43.090
a subsequence of partial
sums corresponding

00:50:43.090 --> 00:50:44.960
to this guy that is bounded.

00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:50.800
So remember, to prove that this
converges, this converges if

00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:55.210
and only if the sequence
of partial sums is bounded.

00:50:55.210 --> 00:50:57.610
And what we're going to
first do towards that

00:50:57.610 --> 00:51:01.267
is prove that there is a
subsequence of partial sums

00:51:01.267 --> 00:51:01.975
which is bounded.

00:51:11.010 --> 00:51:25.480
So we make a first claim that
the sequence of partial sums--

00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:35.580
so s 2 to the k, this is sum
from n goes 1 to 2 to the k

00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:41.910
of 1 over n to the p,
so k a natural number--

00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:47.160
this partial sum is
bounded by a fixed number

00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:56.280
depending on p, 1 plus 1 minus
2 to the minus p minus 1.

00:51:59.170 --> 00:52:04.510
In other words, this subsequence
of partial sums corresponding

00:52:04.510 --> 00:52:06.565
to s 2 to the k is bounded.

00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:14.740
So again, we do this by
grouping these terms according

00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:19.480
to which power of 2
the denominator is

00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:22.210
between, and then
estimate from above now,

00:52:22.210 --> 00:52:25.790
rather than from below like we
did for the harmonic series.

00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:34.940
So we have s 2 to
the k equals 1.

00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:36.890
So again, we're
grouping these terms

00:52:36.890 --> 00:52:44.520
according to where they fall.

00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:47.210
So just write this
out one more time--

00:52:47.210 --> 00:52:57.500
this is equal to 1 plus 1/2 to
the p plus 1 over 3 to the p

00:52:57.500 --> 00:53:08.280
plus 1 over 4 to the p plus 1
over 5 to the p plus 1 over 8

00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:10.200
to the p plus--

00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:12.945
and then up until the last term.

00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:25.870
And now I can write this
as 1 plus the sum from l

00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:30.280
equals 1 to k, so the number
of blocks I have here.

00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:39.840
and now, the terms that
come in each of these

00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:44.700
blocks 1 over into the p.

00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:56.590
And so now I estimate 1 over
n not from below by this guy,

00:53:56.590 --> 00:54:00.760
but from above by
putting in the smallest n

00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:03.130
that n is in this block.

00:54:03.130 --> 00:54:07.360
So this is less than
or equal to 1 plus sum

00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:14.950
from l equals 1 to k sum from
n equals 2 to the l minus 1

00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:20.800
plus 1, 2 to the l 1
over 2 to the l minus 1

00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:23.455
plus 1 raised to the p-th power.

00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:35.130
Now this plus 1 is just making
things bigger on the bottom,

00:54:35.130 --> 00:54:37.350
so if I remove it,
I've made things bigger

00:54:37.350 --> 00:54:39.310
overall for this fraction.

00:54:39.310 --> 00:54:41.490
So this is less than
or equal to sum from 1

00:54:41.490 --> 00:54:50.610
equals l equals 1 to k, sum n
equals 2 to the l minus 1, 2

00:54:50.610 --> 00:54:57.960
the l times 1 over 2 to
the p times l minus 1.

00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:01.118
And now this thing
here, if we do

00:55:01.118 --> 00:55:02.660
the same algebra we
did a minute ago,

00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:08.350
this is equal to
1 l equals 1 to k.

00:55:08.350 --> 00:55:12.920
Now I have this term coming out.

00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:14.800
And then the number
of terms I have here,

00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:18.430
just like I did for the harmonic
series, this is equal to 2

00:55:18.430 --> 00:55:24.520
to the l minus 2 to the
l minus 1 plus 1 plus 1.

00:55:30.450 --> 00:55:41.900
And now this is equal to 1
plus sum from l equals 1 to k.

00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:49.930
And so this whole thing here
is equal to 2 to the l minus 1.

00:55:49.930 --> 00:55:56.530
So I get 2 to the minus
p minus 1 l minus 1.

00:55:59.550 --> 00:56:03.220
Now I can shift this index.

00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:10.590
Actually, I guess I could
have made that sharper

00:56:10.590 --> 00:56:11.530
but it doesn't matter.

00:56:11.530 --> 00:56:14.070
I could shift this index l by--

00:56:14.070 --> 00:56:14.670
no.

00:56:14.670 --> 00:56:18.120
So l starts at 1 and goes to k.

00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:20.340
And here, I have
the sum l minus 1.

00:56:20.340 --> 00:56:26.520
So I can shift this
index to go from now l

00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:33.675
equals 0 to k minus 1, 2
to the minus p minus 1 l.

00:56:36.890 --> 00:56:39.335
So this is like making
a change of variables,

00:56:39.335 --> 00:56:42.050
l prime equals l minus 1.

00:56:42.050 --> 00:56:45.380
And so let me put l
prime instead of l.

00:56:51.020 --> 00:56:55.100
So p is bigger than
1, so this corresponds

00:56:55.100 --> 00:56:58.610
to a geometric series now.

00:56:58.610 --> 00:57:07.420
So let me actually rewrite this
as 1 over 2 to the p minus 1

00:57:07.420 --> 00:57:10.760
to the l prime.

00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:13.730
When p is bigger than 1, then
1 over 2 to the p minus 1

00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:15.110
is less than 1.

00:57:15.110 --> 00:57:20.060
So this thing is a k
minus 1 partial sum

00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:23.870
for the geometric
series with this

00:57:23.870 --> 00:57:27.290
as R. So this is always
bounded above by--

00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:39.520
if I add up all the terms,
which equals that thing that I

00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:45.640
have up there, 1 over 1 minus
2 to the minus p minus 1.

00:57:56.970 --> 00:58:03.120
So that proves that
along this subsequence,

00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:06.840
these partial sums are
bounded by this fixed number.

00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:14.920
And now I claim that this
proves that the whole sequence

00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:19.180
of partial sums is bounded,
in fact, by the same number.

00:58:24.690 --> 00:58:30.310
For all m, a natural
number, s m is less than

00:58:30.310 --> 00:58:32.200
or equal to this number again--

00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:36.100
1 minus 2 to the
minus p minus 1.

00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:44.045
So let m be a natural
number, so we're

00:58:44.045 --> 00:58:45.170
trying to prove this bound.

00:58:45.170 --> 00:58:46.220
What do we do?

00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:51.290
We find a dyadic number,
a number of the form 2

00:58:51.290 --> 00:58:53.630
to the k bigger than m.

00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:57.827
And since 2 to the
m is bigger than m--

00:58:57.827 --> 00:58:59.660
I think that's maybe
one of the first things

00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:01.850
we did by induction--

00:59:05.850 --> 00:59:12.210
we get that s sub m--
which is the partial sum

00:59:12.210 --> 00:59:14.940
of non-negative
terms-- this is going

00:59:14.940 --> 00:59:16.740
to be less than or
equal to, since this

00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:19.710
is a monotone increasing guy,
this is going to be less than

00:59:19.710 --> 00:59:23.310
or equal s to the 2m,
which is less than

00:59:23.310 --> 00:59:29.460
or equal to 1 plus 1 minus
2 to the minus p minus 1.

00:59:37.230 --> 00:59:39.840
Thus, the sequence
of partial sums

00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:53.450
is bounded, which implies
this series converges.

00:59:53.450 --> 00:59:57.040
And that's the end of the proof,
and I think we'll stop there.
