[CLICKING]

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.440
CASEY RODRIGUEZ: So, all
right, so let's start

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.490
talking about some math.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.540
So there was a last
result I was going

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.410
to prove for series, which is
that if you have an absolutely

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.350
convergent series,
and you rearrange it,

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.380
then that series
is also absolutely

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.480
convergent and converges
to the same thing

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.760
as the unarranged series.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.340
But I'm going to leave
that to the lecture notes,

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.350
and we're just going to
start on a new topic.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:53.350
So the topic that we're now
on is continuous functions.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:04.158
And so continuous
functions, as we'll see,

00:01:04.158 --> 00:01:06.960
is a statement about
how a function behaves

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.990
near a point in relation to
how it behaves at the point.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.790
Now, what it means
for a function

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.220
to behave near a point--
that's the notion

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.238
of the limit of
the function, which

00:01:22.238 --> 00:01:23.405
is what we'll first discuss.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.960
OK?

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.280
Now, at what points are
we going to be looking at?

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.840
So this is where
limits take place.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.550
And somehow, we want to look
at a function near points

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.650
where there's a set nearby
to actually look at f at.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.310
So f is usually
defined on some set S,

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.898
and we want to look at points so
that there's a lot of S nearby.

00:02:00.898 --> 00:02:03.190
And we kind of already dealt
with these types of points

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.450
when we encountered cluster
points in the assignment.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.639
So this is exactly where
we start looking at limits.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:15.950
So this is a
definition that I'll

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.030
recall from the assignment.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:30.580
Let S be a subset
of R and x and R.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:46.510
We say x is a cluster point of
S if, for all delta positive,

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.300
the interval x minus delta,
x plus delta intersect

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:59.030
S take away x is non-empty, OK?

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.500
So the new
terminology-- not so new

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.250
since we dealt with
it in the assignment--

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.310
is that of a cluster point.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.680
And another way to
say this is that--

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.420
so an equivalent
way of stating this

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.850
is that, for all delta positive,
there exists, let's say,

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:26.400
a y in S such that 0 is
bigger than x minus y

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.150
is less than delta, OK?

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:37.870
So what this means is that,
as far as the picture goes,

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.270
x is a cluster point
if, when I ever

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.850
take any small
interval about it,

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:51.970
I can find some S in there
other than possibly x.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.730
And this should be able to
be done for every interval.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:03.380
So let's take a look
at some examples.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:12.250
Let's say we take S to be
1/n in a natural number, OK?

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:25.300
And so since now I actually
have people in front of me,

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.100
I can actually ask questions.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.050
So whoever first says
it, what would be

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.103
a cluster point of this set S?

00:04:46.881 --> 00:04:49.280
So what would be a point
in the real numbers

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.340
So that there's a
lot of S near it?

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.580
Feel free to blurt it
out if it comes to you.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.770
Why don't you just take a guess?

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:09.270
1?

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.710
So that's one possibility.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:20.320
So there has to be a lot of
S near this proposed cluster

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.160
point.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.090
So let me mark out the
points that we have.

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.040
There's a-- I'll
put 0, and then 1/2

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:34.670
is there, and then 1/3, 1/4,
1/5, 1/6, so on, and so on.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.470
And so I see a guess of 0.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.860
So that's a good guess as well.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.710
So why would 1 maybe
not be a cluster point?

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:49.190
Well, it's because if I draw
a little interval around 1,

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.460
then there's only one
point in S in here,

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.820
and it's the proposed
cluster point, 1, OK?

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.770
So remember, what we
should be able to do

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:02.320
is find in every small
interval [? sum ?] of S

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.390
in the interval that's not
equal to the point, OK?

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.168
And we can't do that
for the point 1.

00:06:08.168 --> 00:06:13.430
But for 0, if we draw
any interval around 0,

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:19.590
there's plenty of S in the
interval not equal to 0, OK?

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:31.220
So here, 0 is a cluster
point of S. And let's

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.170
give a quick proof of this.

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:41.350
So we have to verify for every
delta positive this interval, 0

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:45.040
minus delta, 0 plus delta
intersect S take away 0

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.030
is non-empty.

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:56.420
So the delta would be positive,
and now here's the picture.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.040
Here's 0.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.540
Here's delta, minus delta.

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.640
We have to show that
there's some S in here.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.690
So we simply choose
natural number n

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:11.200
large enough so
that 1/n is there,

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.940
and we can always
do this because

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.602
of the Archimedean property
of the real numbers, right?

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:23.860
So let delta be positive.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:30.930
Choose natural number n so
that 1/n is less than delta,

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:32.700
and it's certainly
bigger than 0.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.130
So then n is a natural number.

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:46.330
Then 1/n is in x minus
delta, x plus delta intersect

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.640
S take away 0.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:57.770
So this should
have been 0, which

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:07.220
implies this set is non-empty
because it has something in it,

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.806
OK?

00:08:09.806 --> 00:08:12.220
All right, was that example OK?

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.230
Did you all get that all right?

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:21.825
OK, so feel free to ask
questions as they come up.

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:29.500
So let's do another example.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:34.320
This one, I will not
give a full proof of,

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:38.409
but we'll just kind of
talk our way through it.

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:40.975
Let's say S is now the
open interval 0, 1.

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:57.615
What is the set of cluster
points of 0, 1 equal to?

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:06.060
So what would be a reasonable
guess or any guess?

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:20.730
Yeah, so, certainly, this will
contain 0, 1, right, since--

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:23.400
so 0, 1, everything
between 0 and 1

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.740
should be a cluster
point of 0 and 1

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.168
because there's always
a lot of numbers.

00:09:28.168 --> 00:09:30.210
I mean, there's a lot of
numbers between 0 and 1.

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:44.240
So if I draw this 0, 1,
and [? have ?] everything

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.930
in between 0 and 1 is
certainly a cluster point.

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:49.310
What about the point 1?

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:56.120
Is that a cluster
point of this set?

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:16.100
That's a good observation that,
yeah, it's a sup of the set.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:38.280
So for every-- right, so
for every delta positive,

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.740
if I draw a little
interval around 1,

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.590
there's going to be
a number less than 1

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:47.670
that's bigger than 1
minus delta, right?

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:51.720
The set of cluster points
of the open interval 0, 1

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.092
is the closed interval 0, 1.

00:10:54.092 --> 00:10:54.592
OK?

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:03.790
Now, let's do another example.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:09.255
Let's say we look at now,
instead of rational numbers--

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.340
so you should, again,
think of cluster points

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:22.360
as being the set of points
where there is a lot of this set

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:26.080
nearby, OK?

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.705
Now, what is the set of cluster
points of the rational numbers?

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:42.750
OK, so perhaps it will contain
the irrational numbers.

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:45.060
So let's think about
this for a little bit.

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:48.020
So, for example, let's look
at square root of 2, OK?

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.700
Perfectly good rational number--

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.380
I mean, irrational number.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:57.010
If I draw a little interval
around square root of 2,

00:11:57.010 --> 00:12:00.310
can I find a rational
number in there

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:02.350
that's not equal to
a square root of 2?

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:09.640
Right, because we
have this theorem

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.880
about the density of the
rational numbers, right,

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:13.760
that we have--

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:19.060
so remember that this was a
theorem we proved at one point.

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:24.460
For all x, y real numbers
with x less than y,

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:27.820
there exists a
rational number r such

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:33.946
that x is less than r
is less than y, right?

00:12:33.946 --> 00:12:36.990
So we can always find
a rational number here,

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:42.180
or we could have taken another
rational number here, yeah?

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:45.000
So for every interval we
draw around square root of 2,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.350
we can find a rational in there
not equal to square root of 2,

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:49.860
obviously.

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:53.720
But we can find a rational
in that interval, yeah?

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.600
So this suggests that
the set of cluster points

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:59.033
contains the set of irrationals.

00:12:59.033 --> 00:13:00.200
What about rational numbers?

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.940
Are those also cluster points?

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:08.120
Let's say I take 0.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:11.390
Now I look at a small
interval around 0.

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:13.985
Can I find a rational number
in there other than 0?

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.780
I'm not asking like,
actually give me one.

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:25.860
I'm just saying, does there
exist a rational number

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:29.302
in this interval other than 0?

00:13:29.302 --> 00:13:30.080
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.747
CASEY RODRIGUEZ: By
this theorem, right?

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:38.358
You can also use
the theorem to find

00:13:38.358 --> 00:13:40.970
irrational in this
interval as well.

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:45.700
So no matter if it's square root
of 2 or any irrational number,

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.310
no matter if it's
a rational number,

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:51.200
everything is a cluster point.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:56.590
So the set of cluster points of
rational numbers is equal to R,

00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:59.047
OK?

00:13:59.047 --> 00:13:59.630
Is that clear?

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:08.290
OK, feel free to stop me
if you have any questions.

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:17.072
So now let's look
at, for example,

00:14:17.072 --> 00:14:25.520
S equal to just a
single guy, say, 0, OK?

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.440
Remember, cluster
points of a set

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.240
means there's a lot
of that set nearby.

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.690
Now, I claim that this
guy has no cluster

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:45.800
points because if you think
so intuitively why is this,

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.160
this is because, for something
to be a cluster point,

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:52.400
it has to have a lot of
the set near it, a lot.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.710
And there's not a lot
of set to begin with.

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:56.285
There's just one element.

00:14:56.285 --> 00:15:00.710
So let's see why
this is the case, OK?

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:02.450
And this gives us
a chance to negate

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:06.920
the definition of cluster point,
which is always a good idea.

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:14.030
OK, so S equals just
the singleton set, 0.

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:16.220
This has no cluster
points, and so the negation

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:17.850
of the definition
of a cluster point--

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:32.590
so x is not a cluster point
of S means if this is some bad

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:33.100
delta--

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:36.100
remember, so the definition of
cluster point is for all delta.

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:40.060
So negation means there
exists one bad delta

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:45.430
so that x minus delta
0, x plus delta 0

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:55.380
intersect S take away x
equals the empty set, OK?

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:57.570
So the picture that
goes along with this

00:15:57.570 --> 00:16:04.850
is that x does not
cluster point if there's

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:08.540
some interval and
possibly the only S there

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:12.640
is the point x, but
nothing else, OK?

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:21.090
All right, so let's use the
negation of this definition

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:25.195
to show that there are
no cluster points, OK?

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:31.110
And we have to deal
with two cases.

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:50.980
I want to show x is in R, and
x is not a cluster point of S.

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:54.250
And I'll just do the
case x not equal to 0.

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:59.500
x equal to 0 is much easier, so
we'll just do x not equal to 0.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.329
Let's prove this.

00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:09.849
And what's the idea?

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:11.300
We have to be able to find--

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.030
so here's 0.

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:16.540
This is all that S is,
is just this point, 0.

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:19.750
Now we have a point x.

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:23.579
What would be an
interval containing

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:25.365
x that contains none of S?

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:39.500
So x here is just
some nonzero number.

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:43.330
S is what's highlighted.

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:56.810
The interval around x that
doesn't contain any S. So

00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:57.370
like a x/2?

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:07.810
3x over 2, meaning delta equals
x/2, at least for this picture,

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:09.970
yeah?

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:11.990
OK, and that's
essentially the proof.

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:20.410
So choose delta 0, and
we'll simplify this further

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:22.000
and suppose x is positive.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.010
For x less than 0,
you choose delta 0

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:26.290
to be the absolute value of x.

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:28.420
But for this one, this
is simple enough--

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:39.530
choose delta 0 to be x/2 and x
minus delta 0, x plus delta 0

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:43.260
is equal to x/2, 3x over 2.

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:57.585
And since 0 is not in
this set, in this set,

00:18:57.585 --> 00:19:14.540
[? implies ?] intersect S
take away x equals empty, OK?

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:18.620
So we had to find a delta so
that this interval around x

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.230
doesn't contain anything
from S, and we've done that

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:22.820
by choosing delta 0 to be x/2.

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:32.130
OK.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:39.830
So I could have
done it for just--

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:45.450
so I did it for a set
containing just one element,

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:48.360
showed that this set
has no cluster points.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:52.050
You can also show that if
it has finitely many points,

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:55.560
it has no cluster points.

00:19:55.560 --> 00:20:00.200
And so therefore, any finite
set has no cluster points,

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.220
but being a cluster
point has nothing

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:04.420
to do with the cardinality.

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:07.120
So if you see the example
in the notes, which

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.710
you can think about, and I'm
not going to go over right here,

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:14.650
but, for example, x equals
z, the set of integers--

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:30.120
this has no cluster points, OK?

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:35.890
So being a cluster point means,
where is this set clustering?

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:38.490
So it has nothing necessarily
to do with the size of the set

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:45.980
but where the set is taking up
space in the real number line.

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:55.990
All right, so with the
definition of cluster points,

00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:59.020
let me first state the
theorem that, in fact, you

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:08.355
proved in the assignment, which
is that for cluster points--

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:22.810
let S be a subset of R, and
x is a cluster point of S

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:30.880
if and only if
there exist sequence

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:43.600
xn of the elements of and S take
away x such that xn converges

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:46.288
to x, OK?

00:21:46.288 --> 00:21:47.580
And that was in the assignment.

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:50.490
You proved that basically
using the squeeze theorem

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:53.720
in the definition.

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.660
All right, so with the
notion of a cluster point,

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:59.360
these are the points
in a set where

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.420
we're going to start talking
about how a function behaves

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:09.700
near a point, which is the
notion of a limit of a function

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:11.550
is our next definition.

00:22:14.232 --> 00:22:19.400
Let S be a subset of R. And
even though I was referring

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:21.320
to cluster points
earlier as x, we're

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:24.830
now going to switch over to c.

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:38.050
Let c be cluster point of S.
And let f be a function from S

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:41.900
to R, all right?

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:55.880
So you say f of x converges
to L as x goes to c.

00:22:55.880 --> 00:23:00.890
So this is the new
terminology here.

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:10.100
So here, L is a real number
if, for every epsilon positive,

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:22.485
there exists delta positive
such that if x is in S,

00:23:22.485 --> 00:23:27.360
the absolute value of x
minus c is bigger than 0 less

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:34.170
than delta, then f of x
minus L is less than epsilon.

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:41.680
So let's try and compare
this definition a little bit

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:43.910
to what happens for a sequence.

00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:49.270
So for a sequence, the
sequence is getting close to L

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:52.390
as long as we go far
enough out in the sequence,

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:54.820
as long as we look at
terms far enough out.

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:58.540
Now, for limits of functions,
that going far enough

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:01.030
out along the sequence
is replaced by,

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:03.580
as long as we look close
enough to the point c

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:05.170
but not at the point c.

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:16.630
So if you'd like, this
says that if x is near c--

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:19.510
and so this is just an
intuitive interpretation

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:21.760
of what this definition says.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:32.360
If x is near c, then f of x is
near L. And let me also throw

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:40.495
in here that we're saying that
x is near c but not equal to c.

00:24:40.495 --> 00:24:45.230
But for a limit, you don't
look at what happens at f of c.

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:49.160
The function doesn't even
need to be defined there to be

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.750
able to define what a limit is.

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:54.260
We just care about what
happens nearby, OK?

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:58.640
So you could have--

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:02.000
the picture you should have
in mind is that here's c,

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.930
and maybe f is not even
defined up to there,

00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:11.455
but there is f, the graph
of the function f there.

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:25.470
There's L, and as long
as I get very close to c,

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:30.820
I'll be very close
to L, "very close"

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:40.243
being measured within
some strip here, OK?

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:52.440
OK, so this is the notion
of the limit of a function

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:56.310
as we approach a cluster point
of the set S where the function

00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:58.740
f is defined.

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:00.330
Just a little bit of notation--

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:07.510
typically write like
we did with sequences

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:12.670
f of x converges to L as f of
x arrow L. And then I'll write,

00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:14.380
as x goes to c.

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:17.480
Maybe I won't write
as x goes to c.

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:22.970
We note this by limit of
f of x equals L as well.

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:32.910
OK, so first question about
limits is, are they unique?

00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:38.610
And this is, in
fact, why we require

00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:43.050
that c be a cluster point of
S because if we didn't require

00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:45.240
c to be a cluster point
of S in this definition,

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.587
limits would not be unique.

00:26:46.587 --> 00:26:48.420
In fact, you could have
functions converging

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:52.170
to whatever you want because
the definition would then

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:52.920
be vacuous.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:57.400
But if you don't want to
think about that, that's fine.

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:58.300
It's not a big issue.

00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:00.670
But I'm just going to
point out at one point,

00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:03.060
we're going to use the fact
that c is a cluster point

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:05.770
to prove the following theorem.

00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:26.240
So let c be a cluster point
of S, which is a subset of R.

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:30.652
And let f be a
function from S to R.

00:27:30.652 --> 00:27:38.230
If f of x converges
to L1 as x goes to c,

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:48.630
and f of x converges to L2 as
x goes to c, then L1 equals L2,

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:49.130
OK?

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:52.580
So this is what I
mean by uniqueness,

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:56.210
that a function can only have
one limit as it approaches

00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:57.050
a point c.

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:02.816
Let me give the proof.

00:28:02.816 --> 00:28:07.720
So we're going to
play this game again,

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:10.485
where instead of showing
something as 0 or something is

00:28:10.485 --> 00:28:11.860
equal to something
else directly,

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:15.300
we'll give ourselves a little
room and prove the following.

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:20.850
We'll instead show that
while epsilon positive,

00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:24.310
L1 minus L2 is
less than epsilon.

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:29.040
So L1 and L2, these are
just two fixed real numbers.

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.990
If their absolute value
is less than epsilon

00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:34.020
for arbitrary
epsilon, then this is

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:38.040
a number which is smaller
than any positive real number.

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:41.730
That implies that that number
is 0, so L1 equals L2, OK?

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:46.650
Why we give ourselves
a little room

00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:49.920
is because, in the definition,
we have a small parameter there

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.426
which we hope to use.

00:28:51.426 --> 00:28:56.730
So let's prove this.

00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:58.540
Let epsilon be positive.

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:10.890
So since f of x converges
to L1, there exists--

00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:14.830
so just from the definition,
given some small tolerance,

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:23.410
I can find a little
number delta so

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:25.240
that if I look
inside this interval,

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:30.260
I get mapped to the interval L
plus epsilon, L minus epsilon.

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:36.450
So there exists a
delta 1 positive

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:43.253
such that if x is in S-- and
I'm going to probably keep

00:29:43.253 --> 00:29:44.670
forgetting to write
that, but that

00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:47.640
should be understood that x is
in the domain of the function

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:48.600
f.

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:54.660
If x minus c is less than
delta 1 and bigger than 0,

00:29:54.660 --> 00:30:07.950
then f of x minus L1 is
less than epsilon/2, OK?

00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:10.500
And the same thing for L2.

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:13.560
I mean, if f of x
is converging to L2,

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:17.560
then there exists a delta 2 so
that I have the same statement.

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:30.530
So instead, I'm just going to
change this 1 to i, i, i, i.

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:32.940
And here, i equals 1 too.

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:37.340
So since f of x converges to
each of these two numbers, L1

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:40.430
and L2, there exists
a delta 1 and a delta

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:44.480
2 so that if I'm within
this tolerance delta of 1

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:47.840
or delta 2, then f
of x minus delta 1--

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.270
L1 or L2 is less than epsilon/2.

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:57.985
Let delta be the minimum
of these two numbers.

00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:13.390
Now, since c is a cluster
point of S, in fact,

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:21.130
there does exist an x in
S such that 0 is bigger

00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:26.330
than x minus c is less
than delta, all right?

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:29.015
And I'm going to use this
x to compare L1 and L2.

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:37.810
Then since x is in this
interval, or I should say,

00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:38.560
since it's--

00:31:41.969 --> 00:31:45.090
so remember I had
this, which means

00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:51.910
I have this inequality
or i equals 1, 2.

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:58.540
I get f of x, or I
should say, L1 minus L2.

00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:10.510
This is equal to if I
add and subtract f of x

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:19.370
and now use the
triangle inequality

00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:23.870
and use the inequality that's
in green, the f of x minus L1

00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:26.330
is less than epsilon/2.

00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:28.220
And same for L2, I get--

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:34.770
equals epsilon, OK?

00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:36.680
And that's the end
because remember

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:42.995
we started off with the
absolute value of L1 minus L2.

00:32:42.995 --> 00:32:44.555
Are there any
questions about that?

00:32:58.642 --> 00:33:04.420
OK, so not the most
exciting theorem

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:08.530
in the world that this
thing that we've defined.

00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:16.010
A limit is a unique
thing for function.

00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:18.055
But let's start looking
at some examples.

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:27.350
And at one point, we'll
look at the negation

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:29.250
of this definition.

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:33.890
So let's suppose-- so
let's look at the limit

00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:40.060
as x goes to c of the
function ax plus b.

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:45.460
And I claim this is
equal to ac plus b, OK?

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:48.820
So here, S is, although
I didn't write it out,

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:51.430
this function ax
plus b, this is--

00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:57.370
I'm looking at it
defined on all of R,

00:33:57.370 --> 00:34:02.570
and c is a real number, OK?

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:05.170
So we have to verify
this definition.

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:14.110
And since it's
for every epsilon,

00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:15.203
there exists something.

00:34:15.203 --> 00:34:16.620
The beginning of
every proof, I'll

00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:18.370
give you a few points
if you can just say,

00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:21.389
let epsilon be positive.

00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:22.830
How will we choose delta?

00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:27.600
Well, you do
similar computations

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:30.540
as you would if you
were doing epsilon m

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:34.000
arguments for sequences.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.840
So what are after?

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:45.659
We want to find delta so that
x minus c less than delta

00:34:45.659 --> 00:34:51.389
and also bigger than 0 implies
f of x, which is ax plus b,

00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:57.360
minus ac plus b is
less than epsilon.

00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:03.690
So let's start off with
this thing, play with it,

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:07.120
and see if we can find
how to choose delta.

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:09.220
Remember, we don't
solve this inequality.

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:11.920
We want to find
how to choose delta

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:15.580
based on estimating
this thing and trying

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:16.880
to make it less than epsilon.

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:26.030
So f of x minus ac plus
b, absolute value--

00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:27.640
this is equal to
if you just plug

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:33.960
in f of x equals ax plus
b, this equals a times x

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:41.600
minus c, which equals absolute
value of a times x minus c.

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:43.850
And now we're in business
because the thing

00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:47.660
that we do have control
over is the delta, right?

00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:50.060
It is how big x minus c is.

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:53.840
So this is less than absolute
value of a times delta

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:57.720
if x minus c is less than delta.

00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:02.340
And remember, the thing
that we want in the end

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:05.700
is the thing in yellow, and
the thing we get to control

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:06.825
is the thing in green.

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:14.810
So if I want the
thing in yellow,

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:18.905
and I have the thing in
green, how do I choose delta?

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:39.180
So in the end, I want
f of x minus ac plus b

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:40.470
to be less than epsilon.

00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:44.980
Right now, I'm at the absolute
value of a times delta.

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:49.120
Delta is the thing
I get to play with.

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:50.230
So how do I choose it?

00:36:53.710 --> 00:36:55.465
Epsilon to be absolute value--

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:01.690
right?

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:04.780
Because if I choose
delta this way, then x

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:10.540
minus c less than delta implies
that, just by this computation

00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:21.860
here, I would get
epsilon in the end, yeah?

00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:25.520
So that's kind of the scratch
work that goes into it.

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:27.660
Again, delta's the
thing you get to choose.

00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:32.210
You get to choose
based on epsilon.

00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:36.950
And so you look f of
x minus ac plus b.

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:41.570
You estimate it to be no
bigger than the absolute value

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:44.660
of a times x minus c, which is
less than the absolute value

00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:46.140
of a times delta.

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:49.130
And so if you want that thing
to be less than epsilon,

00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:51.350
you should choose,
for example, delta

00:37:51.350 --> 00:37:53.360
to be epsilon over the
absolute value of a.

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:54.620
There's not a unique choice.

00:37:54.620 --> 00:38:00.580
I could have chosen delta to be
epsilon/2 absolute value of a,

00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:04.110
but this is a choice, OK?

00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:08.740
So let epsilon be positive.

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:15.023
Choose delta to be epsilon
over absolute value of a.

00:38:17.801 --> 00:38:24.410
If x minus c is less
than delta, then--

00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:29.070
and when you write
the proof, it's

00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:32.640
essentially a rehashing of the
best parts of your computation.

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:36.930
And f of x minus
a times c plus b,

00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:44.110
this is equal to absolute
value of a times x minus c.

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:47.860
So if we take f of x and
subtract our proposed limit

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:50.470
ac plus b, we get the
absolute value of a times

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:52.600
absolute value of
x minus c, which

00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:56.110
is less than the absolute
value of a times delta, which

00:38:56.110 --> 00:39:09.850
equals epsilon since we chose
delta to be epsilon/a, OK?

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:12.420
That's the proof.

00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:13.620
Are there any questions?

00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:36.570
OK, so let's do another example.

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:45.140
Let's look at the
limit as x goes

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:49.040
to c, a square of the
function square root of x.

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:53.180
And I'm going to show this
is equal to square root of c.

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:55.460
And here, although
I'm not writing it,

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:59.870
S will be, for us, the domain
of the square root, which

00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:03.200
is the closed interval 0,
infinity, not including

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:06.460
infinity, of course.

00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:09.070
And for what I'm going
to do, c is positive, OK?

00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:12.610
You can also do c equal
to 0, but for this proof,

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:13.930
I'm going to do c positive.

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:25.000
All right, so I have to
verify this definition, which

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.210
means for every epsilon,
I can find a delta,

00:40:28.210 --> 00:40:29.720
so let epsilon be positive.

00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:37.990
Let's go over to our box of
scribbling and scratching.

00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:41.290
So remember, our goal
is to find a delta which

00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:45.460
I can choose so that f of
x minus square root of c,

00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:47.450
in this case, is
less than epsilon.

00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:52.620
So if I look at f of x
minus square root of c,

00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:58.220
this is square root of x
minus square root of c.

00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:01.610
And perhaps you remember
from your days in calculus

00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:04.280
that whenever you see the
difference of two square roots,

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:10.700
it's a good idea maybe to
multiply the top and bottom,

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:13.920
or, I guess, multiply by
1 in a very special way,

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:15.840
so that I get the
difference of squares.

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.630
So this is equal
to the square root

00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:22.790
of x minus square root of
c times square root of x

00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:27.850
plus square root of c
all over square root of x

00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:33.920
plus square root of c, OK?

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:36.530
And so now I have--

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:41.660
on the top, I have product
a minus b times a plus b.

00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:44.210
So that's the difference
of squares, which gives me

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:48.230
x minus c on top
over square root of x

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:50.546
plus square root of c, OK?

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:57.560
And remember, this is
less than the thing

00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:59.360
that we're going to
choose in the end.

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:02.640
The absolute value of x
minus c is less than delta,

00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:06.800
so this is less than square
root of x plus square root of c.

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.900
Now, in the end,
you have to only--

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:11.510
you can choose delta
depending only on epsilon

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:14.150
and maybe the point c, OK?

00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:18.630
You cannot choose it to be
dependent on the point x,

00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:20.720
which is changing, right?

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:22.850
What maybe you're
tempted to do here

00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:27.710
is to then choose delta
to be square root of x

00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:32.870
plus square root
of c times epsilon.

00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:37.070
Don't do that because
delta, again, only

00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:39.680
depends on the point c
and the point epsilon.

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:43.290
It cannot depend on the thing
that's changing, which is x,

00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:43.790
right?

00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:46.530
This is changing.

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:49.995
So you don't make this choice.

00:42:52.850 --> 00:42:54.565
Now, if we just
do one more thing,

00:42:54.565 --> 00:42:55.940
then we'll get to
something where

00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:58.640
we can choose an independent of
the thing that's changing, x.

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:03.030
The square root
of x on the bottom

00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:06.940
is only making things smaller
because that's non-negative.

00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:13.098
So this is less than or equal
to delta over square root of c,

00:43:13.098 --> 00:43:15.500
OK?

00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:18.470
So now, in the end, I have
something which is delta

00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:21.260
and depends on
the point c, and I

00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:24.630
want f of x minus square root
of c to be less than epsilon.

00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:25.865
So how should I choose delta?

00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:36.510
Shout it if you know it.

00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:57.350
Right, epsilon times
the square root of c.

00:43:57.350 --> 00:44:00.260
So now this will be our choice.

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:07.880
So choose delta to be epsilon
times square root of c.

00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:16.430
Now we have to show this delta
works, which is essentially,

00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:19.070
again, just rehashing
our computation

00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:22.280
over on the right, which
gave us how to choose delta

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:30.990
than if the absolute value of
x minus c is less than delta,

00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:36.483
f of x minus square
root of c-- and I'm not

00:44:36.483 --> 00:44:37.400
going to write f of x.

00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:57.610
I'm going to write the square
root of x is equal to basically

00:44:57.610 --> 00:44:59.350
what we did over here
in the box, which

00:44:59.350 --> 00:45:03.610
is absolute value of x minus
c over square root of x

00:45:03.610 --> 00:45:09.970
plus square root of c, which
is less than or equal to,

00:45:09.970 --> 00:45:12.730
if I take away the square root
of x on the bottom like we did

00:45:12.730 --> 00:45:16.960
before, which is less than
delta or square root of c, which

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:20.500
equals epsilon square root of
c over square root of c, which

00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:22.490
equals epsilon.

00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:23.730
So this delta works.

00:45:32.198 --> 00:45:34.350
OK, Is there any questions
about that example?

00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:49.610
OK.

00:45:49.610 --> 00:45:55.147
So let's do one more example,
which really illustrates what

00:45:55.147 --> 00:45:57.480
I was getting at when I was
talking about the limit only

00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:01.470
cares about what the function
is doing near a point

00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:02.590
but not at the point.

00:46:02.590 --> 00:46:08.340
So let's say we look at the
function f of x given by 1,

00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:13.740
if x equals 0, and 2,
if x does not equals 0.

00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:21.940
So this is-- here's the point 0.

00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:29.830
And where it's not equal
to 0, it's equal to 2,

00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:36.700
and when x equals 0, it's
equal to 1, all right?

00:46:40.966 --> 00:46:44.900
And they claim that the limit
as x goes to 0 of f of x--

00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:47.960
this equals 2.

00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:53.750
And the thing to
note is that this

00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:59.830
limit it does not
equal f of 0, which

00:46:59.830 --> 00:47:01.780
it did for the previous
two cases, right?

00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:04.120
If we look back at
these two examples

00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:07.090
that we did a minute
ago, the limit

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:09.250
as x goes to c of
both of these examples

00:47:09.250 --> 00:47:13.910
was I just plug in c
to the function, right?

00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:17.040
But for this example,
that's not the case.

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:21.260
The limit is not equal to the
function evaluated at the point

00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:24.050
in highlighting
that limits don't

00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:26.540
care about the function
evaluated at the point.

00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:29.510
They care about what's
happening near the point, OK?

00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:36.420
And near the point, f of x is
just equal to 2 identically.

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:41.030
So I'll give you
the quick proof,

00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:42.980
or you can completely
ignore it and just

00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:49.670
believe that the limit as x goes
to 0 of this function equals 2.

00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:54.170
So the point is that for
x not equal to 0, f of x

00:47:54.170 --> 00:47:55.400
is just a constant 2.

00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:59.245
So let epsilon be positive.

00:47:59.245 --> 00:48:00.870
And you can choose
delta to be whatever

00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:04.530
you like because f of x
when x is not equal to 0

00:48:04.530 --> 00:48:08.850
is going to be equal to
2, the proposed limit.

00:48:08.850 --> 00:48:14.360
Then if 0 is bigger than the
absolute value of x minus 0,

00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:17.130
which is just x,
is less than delta,

00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:20.690
then this implies x
is not equal to 0.

00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:25.010
And therefore, if I
look at f of x minus 2,

00:48:25.010 --> 00:48:36.520
this is just 2 minus 2 equals 0,
which is less than epsilon, OK?

00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:37.930
Any questions
about this example?

00:48:56.550 --> 00:48:57.480
No questions?

00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:16.120
All right, so what we'll
talk about now is--

00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:22.090
so before this section
on continuous functions,

00:49:22.090 --> 00:49:24.490
or at least this section
on limits of functions,

00:49:24.490 --> 00:49:29.130
we had the notion of
limits of sequences.

00:49:29.130 --> 00:49:31.110
And so a natural
question is, how

00:49:31.110 --> 00:49:37.320
do limits of functions
and limits of sequences

00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:41.340
belong together, interact,
relate to each other, I guess,

00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:43.890
is the best way to
phrase that question.

00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:51.480
And the point is that to
decide if a function has

00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:56.310
a limit it, suffices to stick in
sequences that converge to that

00:49:56.310 --> 00:49:58.450
point that you're looking at.

00:49:58.450 --> 00:50:00.840
And that's the content
of the next theorem.

00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:20.950
So let S be a subset of
R, c cluster point of S.

00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:24.990
Let f be a function from S to R.

00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:33.180
Then the limit exists.

00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:39.270
Limit as x goes to c of f of
x equals a number L. This is

00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:46.110
equivalent to the statement
that for every sequence

00:50:46.110 --> 00:50:51.440
x sub n of elements
of S take away

00:50:51.440 --> 00:51:08.160
c such that xn converges to c,
we have f of xn converges to L,

00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:08.730
OK?

00:51:08.730 --> 00:51:10.355
So again, the statement
of this theorem

00:51:10.355 --> 00:51:14.850
is that a function
converges to L if and only

00:51:14.850 --> 00:51:18.000
if for every sequence I
stick into the function which

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:23.540
converges to c, f of x
then converges to L. So

00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:27.980
to choose or to decide
if a function converges,

00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:31.220
it suffices to
look at convergence

00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:32.810
of certain sequences, OK?

00:51:37.890 --> 00:51:38.390
OK.

00:51:41.130 --> 00:51:44.260
And why is this
theorem important,

00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:45.520
or at least very useful?

00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:51.540
It's because with this
theorem, we now get basically

00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:55.620
every analog of theorems we
proved for sequences for free,

00:51:55.620 --> 00:52:01.020
for example, limits of sums
of functions, a squeeze

00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:08.600
theorem that can be stated for
limits of functions, and so on.

00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:10.300
And I'll say a few
comments about this

00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:11.500
after we proved the theorem.

00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:17.420
All right, so let's--

00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:18.610
this is a two-way street.

00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:28.310
And I'm going to mark the
second statement in green.

00:52:28.310 --> 00:52:30.810
That way, I don't have
to rewrite it again.

00:52:30.810 --> 00:52:38.460
So first, assume that limit at
x goes to c of f of x equals L,

00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:44.356
and now we want to prove
the statement in green, OK?

00:52:44.356 --> 00:52:48.310
So here's the idea.

00:52:48.310 --> 00:52:49.620
So now we want to show--

00:52:49.620 --> 00:53:02.180
so let xn be a sequence
of elements in S

00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:09.550
take away c such that
x sub n converges to c.

00:53:09.550 --> 00:53:14.490
And what we want
to show is that f

00:53:14.490 --> 00:53:20.070
of xn, which is
now a new sequence

00:53:20.070 --> 00:53:23.890
converges to L as
n goes to infinity.

00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:31.050
OK, so here, you
should write, as n

00:53:31.050 --> 00:53:40.205
goes to infinity, in here, OK?

00:53:40.205 --> 00:53:45.440
So let me move that, and let
me draw the picture of why

00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:46.460
you should believe this.

00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:51.620
So remember, what it
means for a sequence

00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:54.750
to converge to a number
means, for every epsilon,

00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:57.470
there exists a capital M
so that for all n bigger

00:53:57.470 --> 00:54:01.130
than or equal to capital M, the
sequence is close to the number

00:54:01.130 --> 00:54:03.170
L within epsilon distance to it.

00:54:03.170 --> 00:54:08.760
So let's think about
this a little bit.

00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:10.520
I'm not going to draw the graph.

00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:15.990
I'm just going to draw two
copies of the number line.

00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:22.100
Here, we have the
number L. Here's

00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:29.350
the number c and L plus
epsilon, L minus epsilon.

00:54:29.350 --> 00:54:32.730
So let epsilon be positive.

00:54:35.770 --> 00:54:39.100
And the idea is we want
to be able to find or say

00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:41.380
there exists a natural
number capital M so

00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:45.070
that n bigger than or equal
to capital M implies f of xn

00:54:45.070 --> 00:54:47.920
is inside this interval here.

00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:57.030
Now, since f of x converges
to L as x converges to c,

00:54:57.030 --> 00:55:02.550
there exists a delta so that--

00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:05.890
so this is the picture
that goes along with it--

00:55:05.890 --> 00:55:14.030
so that if I'm inside
this interval here,

00:55:14.030 --> 00:55:19.708
then I get mapped into
this interval here.

00:55:19.708 --> 00:55:22.500
So this is what I get
from the assumption.

00:55:27.170 --> 00:55:30.350
So then how I should choose
the natural number capital

00:55:30.350 --> 00:55:35.631
M is so that all
of the x sub n's

00:55:35.631 --> 00:55:40.220
lie in this interval, c
minus delta, c plus delta.

00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:42.230
And if I can arrange
that, which I can

00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:46.910
because the x sub
n's converge to c,

00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:51.160
then I will get that
these guys get mapped

00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:55.700
into this interval, L plus
epsilon, L minus epsilon, OK?

00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:57.400
And that's the whole
idea of the proof.

00:55:57.400 --> 00:55:58.870
Now we just need
to write it down.

00:56:06.990 --> 00:56:14.270
Since f of x converges to L,
exists a delta positive such

00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:27.260
that if less than delta, then if
x minus L is less than epsilon.

00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:29.280
That's what I drew
in yellow there.

00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:39.590
Now, since the sequence
x sub n equals c,

00:56:39.590 --> 00:56:42.350
this implies that there exists
some natural number M sub

00:56:42.350 --> 00:56:50.030
0 such that little n bigger
than or equal to M sub 0--

00:56:50.030 --> 00:56:53.660
since all of these x sub n's are
not equal to c, by assumption,

00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:57.380
they're in the
set S take away c.

00:56:57.380 --> 00:57:00.140
X sub n minus c, and absolute
value is bigger than 0

00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:04.760
and less than delta, OK?

00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:08.810
This follows from the definition
of convergence of sequences

00:57:08.810 --> 00:57:09.380
to a point.

00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:11.240
Here, if you like,
I'm choosing epsilon

00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:13.460
in that definition to be delta.

00:57:13.460 --> 00:57:16.820
And this delta is coming
from the definition

00:57:16.820 --> 00:57:18.650
for convergence of functions.

00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:29.365
And so we'll choose capital
M to be this integer M sub 0.

00:57:32.290 --> 00:57:35.880
And if n is bigger
than or equal to M,

00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:39.780
I get that, by our choice
of it being M sub 0,

00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:43.320
you get that x sub n minus
c is less than delta.

00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:46.350
That means that it falls in
this little yellow highlighted

00:57:46.350 --> 00:57:53.170
part in the first number
line, which implies--

00:57:58.390 --> 00:58:05.070
so here, what I'm using is
what's highlighted in blue.

00:58:05.070 --> 00:58:10.850
So this is content
of this implication--

00:58:10.850 --> 00:58:19.050
implies that f of xn minus L is
less than epsilon, all right?

00:58:19.050 --> 00:58:20.860
And that's what we
wanted to do, right?

00:58:20.860 --> 00:58:23.940
We wanted to show that there
exists some natural number

00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:28.260
M so that n bigger than or equal
to M implies f of x minus L

00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:31.070
is less than epsilon
in absolute value.

00:58:31.070 --> 00:58:37.630
And therefore, we've
proved that the limit as n

00:58:37.630 --> 00:58:48.365
goes to infinity of the
sequence f of xn equals L.

00:58:48.365 --> 00:58:51.610
OK, so that's one direction of
this if-and-only-if statement.

00:58:51.610 --> 00:58:54.710
Let's prove the
opposite direction.

00:58:54.710 --> 00:59:00.155
So suppose what's
highlighted in green holds.

00:59:06.991 --> 00:59:07.990
OK?

00:59:07.990 --> 00:59:10.700
And this proof is going
to be by contradiction.

00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:15.430
So let's suppose that our
assumption, what's in green,

00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:16.090
holds.

00:59:16.090 --> 00:59:20.761
But the limit as x goes to c
of f of x does not equal L.

00:59:20.761 --> 00:59:27.740
And now we're going to do
the proof by contradiction,

00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:29.825
meaning suppose the
outcome is false.

00:59:37.490 --> 00:59:38.950
OK?

00:59:38.950 --> 00:59:40.780
We're still assuming
what's in green holds.

00:59:40.780 --> 00:59:41.930
That's our assumption.

00:59:41.930 --> 00:59:44.590
And for proof by
contradiction, we

00:59:44.590 --> 00:59:48.520
assume that the outcome
or the conclusion

00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:51.790
is false, which is that the
limit as x goes to c of f of x

00:59:51.790 --> 00:59:55.120
does not equal L.

00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:57.260
Now, what does this mean?

00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:59.080
So now we get to
negate the definition

00:59:59.080 --> 01:00:04.870
and get better
acquainted with it.

01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:09.030
This means that--
so the definition

01:00:09.030 --> 01:00:13.750
of limit, if you go back to
the notes is, for all epsilon,

01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:17.160
there exists a delta statement.

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:20.060
So the negation is
that there exists

01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:24.900
some bad epsilon,
epsilon 0, such

01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:33.610
that for all delta positive,
there exists an x such

01:00:33.610 --> 01:00:50.300
that x is close to c, but f
of x is far away from L. OK?

01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:51.680
So the negation
of the definition

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:53.600
of limit of something
being the limit

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:56.220
is that there
exists a bad epsilon

01:00:56.220 --> 01:01:00.110
so that no matter
how close I get to c,

01:01:00.110 --> 01:01:03.800
I can find something very close
to c that's far away from L

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:07.630
if I stick it into f, OK?

01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:12.660
That's the intuitive way
of viewing the negation

01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:13.680
of this definition.

01:01:17.070 --> 01:01:19.860
OK, so now I'm
going to apply this

01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:25.830
with delta chosen to be 1/n
for in a natural number, OK?

01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:35.800
And this says-- so
this statement here

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:37.700
is a for-all-delta statement.

01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:42.640
So that holds for
every delta I pick.

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:52.020
So for all n, a natural number,
there exists an x sub n such

01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:56.962
that 0 is bigger than x sub n
minus c is less than delta--

01:01:56.962 --> 01:01:58.170
I'm going to pick to be 1/n--

01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:11.310
and f of x sub n minus L
is bigger than or equal

01:02:11.310 --> 01:02:12.300
to epsilon 0.

01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:15.630
So first off, I made
a for-all-n statement.

01:02:15.630 --> 01:02:17.710
Let's think about this
for just a second.

01:02:17.710 --> 01:02:19.410
So certainly, for
delta equals 1,

01:02:19.410 --> 01:02:24.270
I can find a number x sub 1
satisfying 0 is less than x

01:02:24.270 --> 01:02:28.740
minus c is less than 1, and f
of x minus f of x sub 1 minus

01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:32.010
L is bigger than or
equal to epsilon 0.

01:02:32.010 --> 01:02:36.300
But delta can be anything I
choose, so for delta equal 1/2,

01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:38.940
I can find an x
sub 2 such that x

01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:43.890
sub 2 minus c is less than
1/2, and f of x minus L

01:02:43.890 --> 01:02:45.840
is bigger than or
equal to epsilon 0.

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:51.047
So I'm just choosing delta
to be 1/n for each n,

01:02:51.047 --> 01:02:51.755
a natural number.

01:02:57.340 --> 01:03:04.002
Choosing delta to be 1/n, OK?

01:03:04.002 --> 01:03:04.835
Is this point clear?

01:03:11.530 --> 01:03:15.430
OK, please stop me if you
have questions and something

01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:17.620
is not clear.

01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:22.950
OK, so I have this
sequence of elements of S

01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:24.750
that are not equal
to c because they

01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:28.170
are an absolute
value bigger than 0,

01:03:28.170 --> 01:03:32.610
or the absolute value of x sub
n minus c is bigger than 0.

01:03:32.610 --> 01:03:36.690
And they satisfy these
two inequalities, OK?

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:44.035
Then let me just write
this inequality again.

01:03:50.430 --> 01:03:54.390
So then the inequality
that I have is, for all n,

01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:57.210
the natural number 0 is
less than x sub n minus c

01:03:57.210 --> 01:03:59.460
is less than 1/n.

01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:02.760
I claim that the x sub n's
must then converge to c.

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:06.870
What tool can I use to say that?

01:04:14.570 --> 01:04:17.730
Squeeze theorem, OK?

01:04:17.730 --> 01:04:20.190
Because this thing
on the left, 0--

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:22.770
this, if you like,
is a sequence, just

01:04:22.770 --> 01:04:23.670
a constant sequence.

01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:25.470
This converges to 0.

01:04:25.470 --> 01:04:29.100
And 1/n, something on
the right, converges to 0

01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:30.280
as n goes to infinity.

01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:32.280
So that implies the
thing that's sandwiched

01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:34.470
in between gets squeezed to 0.

01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:40.640
So that implies limit as n goes
to infinity of x sub n minus c

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:45.860
equals 0, i.e.,
xn's converge to c.

01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:50.150
Now, I'm assuming what's
in green holds, which

01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:54.170
is, if I take any sequence
converging to c, f of xn

01:04:54.170 --> 01:04:58.680
has to converge to L, OK?

01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:05.080
So by what's in green has
given me this implication--

01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:09.860
0 must be equal to limit
as n goes to infinity

01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:14.730
of f of x sub n minus L.

01:05:14.730 --> 01:05:16.200
But What.

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:21.450
I know is that,
since I've assumed

01:05:21.450 --> 01:05:24.690
f of x does not converge
to L, along this sequence,

01:05:24.690 --> 01:05:27.000
each of these guys is bigger
than or equal to epsilon

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.920
0, which is positive.

01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:37.800
So now I've concluded
that 0 is bigger than 0.

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:44.760
That's a contradiction, OK?

01:05:47.370 --> 01:05:51.000
OK, so next time, we'll
talk about the applications

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.320
of this theorem.

01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:55.800
Do you all have any questions
about this proof or anything

01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:57.975
that we've covered so far today?

01:06:20.302 --> 01:06:22.510
You mean how you get the
choice of delta from doing--

01:06:22.510 --> 01:06:23.772
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:06:23.772 --> 01:06:24.730
CASEY RODRIGUEZ: Right.

01:06:27.570 --> 01:06:29.030
So let me phrase this a--

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:48.860
Yeah, I mean, so--

01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:51.640
and probably in
most classes, you

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:54.640
would just be given this proof
that's over here on the left.

01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:56.350
And somehow it looks
like magic that I

01:06:56.350 --> 01:07:01.270
chose this delta this way,
and it ends up working, right?

01:07:01.270 --> 01:07:05.110
But the thinking that
goes in behind it is--

01:07:05.110 --> 01:07:06.610
so what's the thing you want?

01:07:06.610 --> 01:07:08.290
You want what's in yellow.

01:07:08.290 --> 01:07:12.010
So let me erase some
of what's in yellow.

01:07:12.010 --> 01:07:15.880
You want to choose
delta so that if you

01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:19.180
take f of x minus ac plus b,
that thing in absolute value

01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:22.420
will be less than epsilon, OK?

01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:26.480
So start with that thing
that you want to make small

01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:31.650
and that you want to ensure is
small, f of x minus ac plus b,

01:07:31.650 --> 01:07:34.390
and start computing.

01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:37.690
And when you compute it,
you get what we got here

01:07:37.690 --> 01:07:41.440
in the second bit of yellow.

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:44.890
And we're assuming that the
absolute value of x minus c

01:07:44.890 --> 01:07:46.450
is less than delta, right?

01:07:46.450 --> 01:07:48.310
We're trying to choose
delta so that what's

01:07:48.310 --> 01:07:51.550
in green implies
what's in yellow.

01:07:51.550 --> 01:07:53.720
So far, we haven't chosen delta.

01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:57.100
We just know that the
absolute value of x minus c

01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:58.660
will be less than delta.

01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:00.460
And we want to choose
delta so that that

01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:06.550
implies what's in yellow
after the arrow there.

01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:09.660
So when we do this
computation, and assuming

01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:12.820
that the absolute value of x
minus c is less than delta,

01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:22.180
we get this thing right
here, the absolute value

01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:23.260
of a time delta.

01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:26.800
This is just assuming that the
absolute value of x minus c

01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:32.040
is less than delta, which
is what will it be assuming.

01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:34.319
And we want what's in
yellow, which is that thing

01:08:34.319 --> 01:08:35.560
to be less than epsilon.

01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:39.550
So what we've arrived
at is this thing here,

01:08:39.550 --> 01:08:41.700
which we want less
than epsilon, is less

01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:46.250
than this thing in red, OK?

01:08:46.250 --> 01:08:48.890
And therefore, we want
to choose the delta

01:08:48.890 --> 01:08:51.740
so that the thing in
red is less than epsilon

01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:53.960
or less than or
equal to epsilon.

01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:56.960
That will ensure
that f of x minus ac

01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:00.390
plus b in absolute value will
be less than epsilon, OK?

01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:02.960
So I'm not solving
an inequality.

01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:05.160
I'm not solving the
inequality I want,

01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:07.490
which is f of x minus ac plus b.

01:09:07.490 --> 01:09:10.189
I'm starting with
what's on the left,

01:09:10.189 --> 01:09:12.920
estimating it using my
assumptions, and then,

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:15.140
at the end, choosing
delta so that I come up

01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:17.220
with epsilon in the end.

01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:20.540
So in the last step,
I have absolute value

01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:22.439
of a times delta.

01:09:22.439 --> 01:09:25.380
And I want that to
be less than epsilon.

01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:31.149
So I could have chosen
delta to be less than

01:09:31.149 --> 01:09:32.875
or equal to epsilon/a.

01:09:35.790 --> 01:09:38.410
So anything, any delta like
that would have worked.

01:09:38.410 --> 01:09:42.149
So I could have put delta
to be epsilon over 2a.

01:09:42.149 --> 01:09:44.677
That still would have
worked, or 3a, OK?

01:09:57.870 --> 01:09:59.370
Yes, [? what ?]
[? they're ?] green.

01:09:59.370 --> 01:10:02.720
That's the thing
we're doing, thing we

01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:05.840
get to use in this computation.

01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:10.290
Are there any other questions?

01:10:43.770 --> 01:10:47.400
This is a style
thing, all right?

01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:53.130
So throughout this entire
semester, for all epsilon,

01:10:53.130 --> 01:10:56.890
you have to be able to find the
M so that something happens,

01:10:56.890 --> 01:10:57.390
right?

01:10:57.390 --> 01:10:59.880
So at some point, you
always say, choose

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:02.170
M to be something, right?

01:11:02.170 --> 01:11:05.970
Maybe it's the maximum of
some M0, M1 that you had.

01:11:05.970 --> 01:11:11.010
Or choose M to be so that 1/M is
less than epsilon or something

01:11:11.010 --> 01:11:11.800
like that.

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:16.080
So I'm just sticking with
that style of saying,

01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:17.400
choose M to be this.

01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:20.820
Otherwise, I could
have said, there

01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:24.750
exists a capital number M
so that for all n bigger

01:11:24.750 --> 01:11:28.200
than or equal to
capital M, x sub n minus

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:31.860
c is less than delta, and
then move to the next part.

01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:35.190
But throughout the course, I've
always, at least in the proofs

01:11:35.190 --> 01:11:40.830
I presented, you're making a
choice of capital M, right?

01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:43.320
It's for all
epsilon, there exists

01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:45.510
a capital M. So that
means you have to tell me

01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:47.040
how to choose capital M.

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:49.680
And it's the same thing
with these epsilon

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:52.350
delta proofs is that, for all
epsilon, there exists a delta.

01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:54.510
So at some point, you
have to tell me how

01:11:54.510 --> 01:11:57.820
to choose delta in the proof.

01:11:57.820 --> 01:12:00.090
So I've just kind of
stuck with that style

01:12:00.090 --> 01:12:04.775
of saying, choose M to be
something, although you're

01:12:04.775 --> 01:12:06.650
absolutely right that
I could have just said,

01:12:06.650 --> 01:12:08.960
for all n bigger than
or equal to capital M0,

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:10.340
I have what I want.

01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:13.190
And therefore,
implicitly, I'm saying

01:12:13.190 --> 01:12:16.490
that M equals M0 is
the thing that works.

01:12:33.210 --> 01:12:35.753
Yeah, that's the same delta.

01:12:35.753 --> 01:12:36.920
Yeah, that's the same delta.

01:12:43.490 --> 01:12:45.040
Mhm.
