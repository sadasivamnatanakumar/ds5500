CASEY RODRIGUEZ: So
we ended last time

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.127
with these elementary
properties that you

00:00:18.127 --> 00:00:19.605
know about the absolute value.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:29.400
So let me prove one more theorem
about the absolute value, which

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.680
maybe you didn't
cover in calculus.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:42.070
But it's of
fundamental importance

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.770
in real analysis, which is
the triangle inequality, which

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:55.630
states that for all xy in R,
the absolute value of x plus y

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:01.000
is less than or equal to
the absolute value of x

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.590
plus the absolute value of y.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.650
So why is it called the
triangle inequality?

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.410
Well, let me-- instead of
x and y being real numbers,

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.650
let's think of these as vectors.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.670
So there's x.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:30.310
Let's say y.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:38.275
And then vector x
plus y is this side.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.380
Then what this is stating
is that the length

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.500
of one of these sides
of this triangle

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.780
is less than or equal
to the sum of the two

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.863
sides, the sum of the lengths
of the other two sides

00:01:55.863 --> 00:01:56.530
of the triangle.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:06.120
So that's why it's called
the triangle inequality.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:14.070
OK, so the proof is
not very difficult,

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.690
although this
inequality is probably

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.880
one of the three most
useful things you'll

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.400
learn in this class if you go
on to study more analysis--

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.740
the other one being--

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.380
OK, so I'm coming--

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.020
this is knowledge from PDE.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.560
So I guess I'm viewing it
through that lens of what

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.910
I find useful in PDEs.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.300
But triangle inequality,
integration by parts,

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:47.780
change of variables, those
three power the analysis machine

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.860
that I'm most familiar with.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.280
So how to prove the
triangle inequality--

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:05.000
if x and y is an R, then
clearly, by property number 6,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.400
the x is less than or
equal to the absolute value

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.610
of x and y is less than or equal
to the absolute value of y.

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.040
So their sum is less than or
equal to the absolute value

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.030
of x plus y.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.240
And not only that, I can
replace x by minus x and I

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.090
get minus x plus
minus y, this is

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.860
less than or equal to the
absolute value of minus x

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.690
plus the absolute
value of minus y.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.185
But this is just absolute
value of x plus y.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.430
And both of these
therefore imply--

00:03:48.430 --> 00:04:05.660
so if I just take this and
multiply through by minus 1,

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.320
this inequality,
which, by number 5

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.340
in the properties that we
proved, for the absolute value

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.010
implies that the absolute
value of x plus y is less than

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.290
or equal to the
absolute value of x

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.690
plus the absolute value of y.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.750
So let me just make a remark
about the reverse triangle

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:41.630
Inequality, which will make an
appearance in your assignment.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:47.750
And so this involves the
absolute value of x minus y

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.840
and the absolute value
of the difference

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.700
in the absolute values.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.570
Why is it reverse?

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:54.965
Because the inequality reverses.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.810
The absolute value of x minus
the absolute value and y,

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.470
take the absolute value.

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.280
This is less than or equal
to the absolute value

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.090
of x minus y.

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.940
And you'll prove this
in the assignment.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.750
So these two-- so this follows
from the triangle inequality.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.522
But these two inequalities
get used quite a bit.

00:05:21.522 --> 00:05:23.730
And we'll use them quite a
bit throughout the course.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:41.710
All right, so let me take
a minute to reconnect R

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:46.660
with what you know and love
from calculus, namely decimals.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.960
And we're going to
use this fact about R

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.980
to answer a natural
question that maybe you're

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.800
asking yourself, which
is the following.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.500
So let me raise
this as a question.

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.270
So this first part
is not the question.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.370
We've already addressed this in
the first assignment, the fact

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.560
that the rationals is countable.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.540
In fact, you did it for
the positive rationals.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.940
But if the positive
rationals are countable,

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:24.520
you can then prove that all
rationals are countable.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:33.663
And a natural question--
is R countable?

00:06:33.663 --> 00:06:35.330
Or is the set of real
numbers countable?

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.850
So in the end--

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.430
I'm not going to leave
you in suspense--

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.100
the answer is no.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.532
And we're going to prove this.

00:06:51.532 --> 00:06:53.865
But let me just make a few
remarks about what this says.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:02.040
So it's the following.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:08.200
So if Q-- so this is
not a proof of this.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.260
I'm just going to make a
remark based on this answer.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:32.120
So since R is uncountable
and Q is countable,

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:41.810
this implies that R takeaway Q,
the set of irrational numbers,

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:47.890
is, in fact, uncountable.

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:48.390
Why?

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:55.070
So I'm just going to say
in words why this is true.

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:58.780
So suppose otherwise that
both the rational numbers

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:01.210
and the irrationals
are countable.

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:03.700
Then you can map in
a bijective fashion

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:10.130
the rationals to the natural
numbers and the irrationals

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:11.510
also to the natural numbers.

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:15.050
But then you can map those
natural numbers to 0, minus 1,

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:18.120
minus 2, minus 3, and so on.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.390
So then you find that
there is a bijection

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:24.320
from Q to the natural
numbers and the irrationals

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.200
to the integers less
than or equal to 0.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.040
And therefore, there's bijection
from R to the integers.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.720
But the integers are countable,
which would contradict the fact

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.760
that R is uncountable.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.630
Therefore, the set of
irrationals is uncountable.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:45.370
So in short, if you
didn't follow that,

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:48.850
the set of irrationals
is uncountable

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:53.650
because otherwise this would
force R to be countable.

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:56.328
Now, I haven't proved yet
that R is uncountable.

00:08:56.328 --> 00:08:57.620
We'll do that in just a minute.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:02.290
And we'll use a theorem about
decimal expansions for--

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:04.105
or decimal representations
of real numbers.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:15.440
So now, connecting
rationals and irrationals

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.580
to what you've seen
since you were small,

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:21.260
so to decimals, we simply--

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:31.140
we typically-- we think
of rational numbers

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:44.080
as in terms of decimal
representations.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.640
What does that mean?

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.030
That means we take--

00:09:49.030 --> 00:10:01.420
if x is in Q, then we'll write x
as some number times some digit

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:10.330
times 10 to the k plus 10
to the k minus 1 plus d0.

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:15.700
And then we go to the
tenths spot, so d to the--

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:19.570
d minus 1 10 to
the minus 1 plus--

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:20.710
so this is discussion.

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:26.640
I'm not stating any
theorems right now,

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:35.920
until we get down to maybe
some last decimal spot.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:57.540
And with these digits,
a subset of 0, 1, 9.

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.190
So all I'm saying is typically
we think of x as this way.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:14.520
And then we write x as dk, dk
minus 1, d minus 1, d minus 2,

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.150
and so on.

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:24.380
I'm using this notation
because I'm going to be--

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.380
this is the notation I
need to state the theorem

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:27.970
about the real numbers.

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:33.010
But it's quite silly that
I'm about to write this down

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:36.130
in this setting.

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:38.470
Welcome to MIT.

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:48.610
So for example, 1
times 10 plus 1 times

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:53.185
10 to the 0 plus 1
times 10 to the minus 1.

00:11:56.230 --> 00:12:04.950
This is supposed to represent
the number 11.1, which

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:06.180
is the rational number.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.640
It's quite funny that I had to
think about that for a minute

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.400
to go from the decimal expansion
to the rational numbers.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:33.170
But don't give me
too hard of a time.

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:37.695
In a lot of at least
pure math, we typically

00:12:37.695 --> 00:12:39.070
write things in
rational numbers.

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:40.720
We don't write in decimal--

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.480
I haven't had to write in
decimal expansion in quite

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.360
some time.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:48.670
Anyways, now, of course,
not all rational numbers

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:51.280
can be written as a
finite decimal expansion.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.680
For example, 1/3
you have to write

00:12:53.680 --> 00:13:01.940
as 0.33333 and so on and so on.

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:05.110
So that's not necessarily
covered under the discussion

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:07.790
that I have right here.

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:10.540
But it will be
covered in what I'm

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.760
about to say for
the real numbers.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.180
So we could cover 1/3.

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:18.340
And then we can also
cover every real number

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:22.630
if we allow infinite
decimal representations.

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:24.910
So I'll use the word decimal
expansions or decimal

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:27.430
representations
interchangeably there.

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:31.538
So let me make a definition.

00:13:31.538 --> 00:13:33.580
And what I'm going to
state is about real numbers

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:35.380
between 0 and 1.

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:37.660
Of course, if you want to
talk about real numbers

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:41.500
bigger than 1, then you
just tack on 1 to the--

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.285
if you like, to the d0 place.

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.340
So the infinite part is
having to deal with what

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:57.560
comes after the decimal point.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:00.290
So the let me make
the following.

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:03.220
So this is a
rigorous definition.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:06.550
Let x in 0, 1 excluding 0.

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:16.201
And let d minus j
be in 0, 1 to 9.

00:14:24.767 --> 00:14:29.130
for j, a natural number.

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:34.290
So we say x is--

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:40.480
so what does it
mean to say that x

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.990
is given by an infinite
decimal expansion

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:48.130
or given by an infinite
decimal representation?

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:52.690
We say x is represented
by the digits.

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:13.800
And we write x is equal to d
minus 1, d minus 2, d minus 3.

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:21.110
If-- so this is the
precise meaning of this.

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:27.955
If x is equal to the
supremum of the set--

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:35.010
so I take a finite
decimal expansion.

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:46.760
And then so I get a number
for each n, a natural number.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:51.200
So the first one is just d
minus 1 10 to the minus 1.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.260
And then for n equals 2, I
tack on next hundredths place,

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:55.920
and then the thousandths place.

00:15:55.920 --> 00:16:00.650
And so I get a set
of real numbers.

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:02.720
If I take its
supremum and I get x,

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:08.810
then I say that x is represented
by these digits or that x--

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:12.200
or that this gives a
decimal representation of x.

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:25.075
So that you see this lines
up with what you know,

00:16:25.075 --> 00:16:32.470
if I look at 0.250000, remember
this is now the sup of what?

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:36.640
Of a certain set.

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.400
So let me do first this guy.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:43.330
So this is 2/10.

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:48.070
And then now, I add the
hundredths place plus 5/100,

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:53.980
and then 2/10 plus 5/100--
this is a set, remember--

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:59.590
plus 0/1000 over plus--

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:03.280
and at each next
guy, I'm supposed

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:06.069
to take this and
add on another 0.

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:13.210
So as a set, this is just a
set containing two elements,

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:24.930
namely 2/10 and 25/100.

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:28.420
And so this is
bigger than that guy.

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:31.770
So the supremum is
25/100, which equals 1/4.

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:33.790
OK, so all of that
to tell you that,

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:36.400
yes, this definition should--

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.510
or at least does
ring true with what

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:51.040
you were taught, that 1/4
is equal to 0.25, all right?

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:56.715
OK, so now that what we're done
with the triangle inequality,

00:17:56.715 --> 00:17:57.715
I'm going to erase this.

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:37.360
And so this is the
last bit of discussion

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:40.693
about the elementary
properties of the real numbers.

00:18:40.693 --> 00:18:42.985
Next, we'll be talking about
sequences of real numbers.

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:54.310
OK, so all right, so I
have this definition.

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:57.550
The fundamental theorem
about the real numbers

00:18:57.550 --> 00:19:00.460
is that every real number, at
least in this setting between 0

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:05.690
and 1, can be represented
by a set of digits

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:11.070
or it has a decimal
representation.

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:14.310
And every decimal-- if you
like, every set of digits

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:17.340
corresponds to a
decimal representation

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:18.550
of a real number.

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:24.340
So let me state the
second thing I said first.

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:56.870
So for every set of digits d
minus j with each of these d

00:19:56.870 --> 00:20:10.530
minus j's in 0 up
to 9, then there

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:23.660
exists a unique x in
closed interval 0, 1 such

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:28.700
that x is equal to d minus 1--

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:30.680
with this decimal
representation.

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:38.150
So you give me some
digits and I can

00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:40.610
find a unique real
number that has

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:44.000
that decimal representation.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.020
Now, before I state the
second part of the theorem,

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.970
this says that I
give you digits,

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:51.600
I get a unique real number.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.900
Now, you ask about
the other direction.

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:57.620
If I have a real number, do
I get a unique set of digits?

00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:01.430
And of course, that is
not true necessarily

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:16.960
because, for example, 1/2, this
is equal to 0.500 and so on.

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:22.420
But this is also equal
to 0.4999 and so on.

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:31.370
So yes, every set of digits
gives me a unique real number.

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:32.990
So if I gave you
these digits, they

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:34.940
would spit out 1/2 and only 1/2.

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:37.940
It wouldn't spit out 1/4.

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:40.260
But if you give
me a real number,

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:46.480
there does not necessarily
exist a unique set

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:49.570
of digits giving a decimal
expansion for that number.

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:52.060
So I can have two different
decimal expansions.

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:54.745
I have 0.5 and I have 0.4999.

00:21:54.745 --> 00:21:56.620
I will always have at
least one, but it's not

00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:58.300
necessarily unique.

00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:02.590
But we can single
out one unique choice

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:06.730
by requiring that, in some
sense, if I were to truncate

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:10.660
it, then the decimal expansion
would be less than the number

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:13.870
I'm looking at and
wanting to expand.

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:17.190
So that's the second
part of this theorem,

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:28.430
is that for every x in
0, 1, now excluding 0,

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:36.070
there exists unique digits--

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:47.530
and as before, these
are in 0 up to 9--

00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:53.560
such that x is--

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:56.230
such that these give a
decimal representation of x.

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:04.610
And so what singles out a
choice if we're ever coming up

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:05.720
against these two things?

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:17.128
And if I truncate the
decimal expansion--

00:23:17.128 --> 00:23:18.920
so I'm not going to
write zeros after that.

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:22.880
I'm just going to truncate
it-- this always is less than x

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:31.635
and this is less than or equal
to plus 10 to the minus n.

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:47.520
All right, so this
inequality will always hold.

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:53.600
And in fact, so this
inequality will always hold.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.280
And in fact, x is
always bigger than

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.140
or equal to this
side, no matter what.

00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:03.320
If x is given by a
decimal representation,

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:06.950
so we always have these two.

00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:08.720
This is a less than
or equal to and this

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.160
is a less than or equal to.

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.960
But we single out
a unique choice

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:15.110
of decimal representation
by choosing

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:17.630
this to be a strict less than.

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:23.690
So then that forces us to
choose this guy over this guy.

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:32.540
So for theorem 2, this would say
that the unique representation

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:36.680
that satisfies this for
1/2 is given by 0.4999.

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:42.060
And for example, for
1 would be just 0.9999

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:45.390
because if I take this
representation and cut it off,

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:51.990
this is actually equal to
1/2 and not less than 1/2.

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:55.410
OK, so that was a lot of
discussion about the theorem.

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:57.510
But that was for a reason
because I'm not actually

00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:00.450
going to prove this theorem.

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:04.980
It's not entirely
difficult. It just uses

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:07.420
the least upper bound
property of the real numbers.

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:12.350
But it's a little
clunky to write down.

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:16.400
And what I'd rather do
is just use this theorem

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:21.110
to prove my answer, the
answer to my question

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:25.880
up there, on whether R
is accountable or not.

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:27.950
In the textbook,
there is a proof

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:29.450
of this theorem,
which you can read.

00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:39.270
OK, so we're actually
going to use this theorem

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:46.790
to prove the following
theorem due to Cantor.

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:50.330
So we just went from absolute
values, which maybe it was not

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:53.600
too shock and awe, now to this
theorem, which to me is shock

00:25:53.600 --> 00:26:12.530
and awe, is the following,
that the interval 0, 1 is

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:13.280
uncountable.

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:22.710
All right, so maybe
you're asking yourself,

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:25.700
well, that's showing
this is uncountable.

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:32.490
And that's saying
R is uncountable.

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:35.700
So where do we go
from this to that?

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:37.310
Well, I'll let you
think about that.

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:40.280
But let's assume
this was uncountable

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.640
and R was countable.

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:44.990
So I'm just going to say
this, say why out loud.

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:49.700
If this was uncountable
and R was countable,

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:55.640
then since this is a subset
of R, that means this under

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.840
would be--

00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.790
so let me just write.

00:27:08.592 --> 00:27:09.810
Why does this imply--

00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:16.920
And I'm going to give
you a fake proof,

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:22.078
but you can actually make
this completely rigorous--

00:27:22.078 --> 00:27:23.620
fake proof in the
sense that I'm just

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:29.050
going to write symbols
that imply this.

00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:34.150
So why is R uncountable
then if this is uncountable?

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:39.460
Well, the function that
takes an element in here

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:43.100
just into R, this is
clearly bijective.

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:49.690
so just the identity map from
0, 1 into R is an injective map.

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:57.310
So I clearly have that the
cardinality of this set

00:27:57.310 --> 00:28:01.900
is less than or equal
to the cardinality of R.

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:04.190
In fact, maybe you
can think about it.

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:05.690
Maybe I'll put it
on the assignment.

00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:10.480
But in fact, one can prove
they have the same cardinality.

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:14.470
But I have that.

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:15.850
And this is uncountable.

00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:19.120
Therefore, its
cardinality is bigger

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:22.370
than the natural numbers.

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:24.850
So this should imply
that cardinality

00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:32.600
of the natural numbers is less
than the cardinality of R.

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:37.230
In other words,
R is uncountable.

00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:41.160
All right, so let's prove
this theorem due to Cantor.

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:44.370
Now, this other
theorem due to Cantor,

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:48.428
that the cardinality
of the power set

00:28:48.428 --> 00:28:50.220
is bigger than the
cardinality of the set--

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.150
I mean, that was--

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:57.420
at least the proof,
the first time

00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:59.610
I saw it, that was
some crazy shit.

00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:03.600
And this is also going to be
some pretty crazy and clever

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:06.620
shit, too.

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:10.490
So this is what's referred to
as Cantor's diagonalization

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:14.432
argument or diagonal argument.

00:29:14.432 --> 00:29:15.390
And it's the following.

00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:17.307
So we're going to prove
this by contradiction.

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:26.613
So we're going to assume
that this is countable.

00:29:26.613 --> 00:29:27.530
So it can't be finite.

00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:30.690
There's infinitely many
of the elements in here.

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:41.082
So suppose that, in fact,
it has the cardinality

00:29:41.082 --> 00:29:42.040
of the natural numbers.

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:49.480
And we're going to arrive
at a contradiction.

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:53.970
So then there exists
a function, which

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:58.890
I'm going to call x,
from natural numbers

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:05.000
into 0, 1, which is bijective.

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:32.670
Now, so let me label
this inequality star.

00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:38.910
For each n, we write x of n.

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:41.730
So this is an element of 0, 1.

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:42.960
So this is bijective.

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:46.560
So every element in
0 gets mapped onto.

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:54.760
So we write x of n to be in
its decimal representation.

00:30:54.760 --> 00:31:00.610
I have two indices now-- one
for the digit place and the one

00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:02.605
for which--

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:10.052
excuse me.

00:31:10.052 --> 00:31:11.760
At least I sheltered
you from that sneeze

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:13.440
by putting my hand
over the microphone.

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:14.870
Is the microphone still on?

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:15.870
Yeah.

00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:25.260
OK, so for each n, we write
each x of n in its decimal

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:36.050
representation, satisfying star.

00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:41.460
So each x in here can
be written uniquely

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:43.890
in a given decimal
representation satisfying

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:45.800
this inequality here.

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:47.670
And what we're
going to do is we're

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:57.610
going to come up with a real
number in the interval 0, 1

00:31:57.610 --> 00:32:01.030
which x does not map to,
which therefore contradicts

00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:02.770
the fact that x is surjective.

00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:07.660
And bijective surjective
means that everything

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:08.950
has to get mapped onto.

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:11.350
That's the onto part.

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:13.330
Injective means it
maps different things

00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:14.770
to different things.

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:22.780
So what's the idea of
finding this element that

00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:25.680
doesn't get mapped onto?

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:57.990
So let me write down just a few
of these decimal expansions.

00:32:57.990 --> 00:33:00.240
And I may not want
to do a fourth one.

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:08.970
And maybe I do.

00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:10.698
So this is, again, discussion.

00:33:10.698 --> 00:33:12.240
So I'm going to put
this in brackets,

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.823
meaning this is not
part of the proof,

00:33:13.823 --> 00:33:17.520
but this is part of the
idea of what's going on.

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:22.290
And where's the diagonal part?

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:35.200
OK, so and this should go
off in this direction .

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:38.120
And the decimal expansion is
marked off in that direction.

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:43.360
And so somehow, this list, if
it kept going in that direction,

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:47.890
would have to contain every
real number between 0 and 1.

00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:52.360
And so what's the idea to come
up with a real number between 0

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:58.120
and one that is not in
this list is we go down

00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:06.850
the diagonal of the
decimal expansions

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:14.010
and we change each decimal to
something else than what it is.

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:20.810
And so therefore-- and
then I take my element y.

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:31.449
So remember, we're trying to
find a y not in this list.

00:34:31.449 --> 00:34:35.340
And then I would take
y to be the real number

00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:46.190
that I get by changing each
of these decimal digits.

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:49.130
So you can imagine if
y somehow popped up--

00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:52.909
let's say it popped up, since
I don't want to write anymore,

00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:56.389
as x4, then somehow
this number would

00:34:56.389 --> 00:35:01.820
have to be the digit
for y, but I changed it.

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:03.740
And therefore, it's
not the digit of y.

00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:10.340
So that's it in a nutshell.

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:13.970
If you didn't get
that, that's fine.

00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:19.730
Let me now write
out the details.

00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:23.330
So it's a little bit simpler
to imagine if, let's say,

00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:24.740
all of these were 0's and 1's.

00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:28.310
So instead of being base
10, now it's base 2.

00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:31.340
And so instead of--

00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:33.890
if the digit was the 0,
I've flipped it to 1.

00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:37.820
So you can imagine
that if y did--

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:42.590
so and then I form y
by flipping the digits.

00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:51.440
So if this was 0, 0, 1, 1, then
y would start off 1, 1, 0, 0.

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:56.840
And therefore, if y appeared,
say, fourth in line,

00:35:56.840 --> 00:36:02.510
it would have to be 1
and 0 in the same spot

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:05.540
just by how I've constructed
y by flipping it.

00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:07.730
And therefore, y
can't be in that list.

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:12.010
And therefore, this map
cannot be surjective,

00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:14.690
which is our contradiction.

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:16.900
So let me make
this more precise.

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:27.810
Let ej-- this is going to be 1.

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:39.680
If the j-th digit
of the j-th x of j

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:50.630
does not equal 1;
2, if the j-th digit

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:57.240
of the j-th guy in that list,
or x of j, does equal 1.

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:09.370
By part 1 of the theorem,
previous theorem,

00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:18.320
there exists the unique
y in 0, 1 without 0--

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:18.820
why?

00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:22.600
Because some of these
digits are non-zero.

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:24.130
It's always either 1 or 2--

00:37:28.875 --> 00:37:36.650
such that y is equal to e
minus 1, e minus 2, and so on.

00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:59.860
So moreover, since all of
these digits are either 1 or 2,

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:05.750
they are certainly non-zero.

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:12.200
So y is given by a decimal
expansion where all

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:14.900
of these things are non-zero.

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:21.560
So that means that for
all n, a natural number,

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:26.870
if I take a finite decimal
expansion-- so I cut this

00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:31.070
off at e to the minus n--
since e to the e minus n

00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:34.770
plus 1 is either 1 or 2,
that's going to be positive.

00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:39.470
So that's less than y.

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:41.690
And this is always
the case, that this

00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:42.980
is less than or equal to.

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:52.680
So because all these
digits are positive,

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:54.870
if I cut it off,
if I truncate it,

00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:58.410
then that number is
going to be less than y

00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:01.380
because I'm missing stuff
out in the millionths place

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:06.720
or whatever each
time for each n.

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:17.570
And therefore, this
decimal expansion

00:39:17.570 --> 00:39:31.490
is the unique decimal
representation

00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:35.330
from part 2 of the
theorem that I stated.

00:39:35.330 --> 00:39:38.090
Every element in 0, 1 has
a unique representation,

00:39:38.090 --> 00:39:40.070
satisfying that inequality.

00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:44.120
Because all of these digits
are positive, this, in fact,

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:46.130
is a unique representation
of this element

00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:51.410
y, which I've constructed by
flipping digits from this map.

00:39:56.580 --> 00:40:09.240
Now, since x is
surjective, there

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:12.890
exists an n, natural number--

00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:14.750
this n has nothing
to do with that n.

00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:19.100
Maybe I'll use a
different letter, m--

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:23.000
such that y equals x of m.

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:34.130
Then let's say I look
at e to the minus m.

00:40:36.976 --> 00:40:41.640
So then this says
that the m-th digit,

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:52.790
which should be giving me e
to the minus m because this is

00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:55.280
equal to --

00:40:55.280 --> 00:41:14.580
this, remember, is equal to
1 if dm 2 if dm equals 1.

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:18.915
In particular, this
does not equal dm.

00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:27.885
So I have proven that this
number does not equal itself.

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:34.310
All right, I can never if--

00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:37.220
I can never have
this number, whatever

00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:41.000
it is, equal to this thing
because I'm always changing it.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:47.210
If this thing is 1,
then this number is 2.

00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:49.917
If this number is not 1,
then this number is 1.

00:41:49.917 --> 00:41:51.500
And therefore, it's
not equal to that.

00:41:55.276 --> 00:41:58.510
And this is a contradiction.

00:41:58.510 --> 00:42:11.170
Thus, it shows that
this set is uncountable.

00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:20.650
So I hope I explained
that well enough.

00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:27.220
You can also look in the
textbook for an explanation

00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:28.045
as well.

00:42:28.045 --> 00:42:29.920
And of course, you can
ask me in office hours

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:34.480
for more explanation.

00:42:37.462 --> 00:42:39.070
Let me fuel up real quick.

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:48.595
OK, now, we're moving
onto a new chapter.

00:42:56.717 --> 00:42:57.675
We're going to get to--

00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:04.500
now, we're going to get
to the analysis part.

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:07.550
So analysis as I've said
before, is the study of limits.

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:09.620
Real analysis is the
study of limits that

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:12.780
has to deal with real numbers.

00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:19.620
So let's get to our
first notion of a limit.

00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:21.915
And that is the limit of a
sequence of real numbers.

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:33.190
So now, we're moving onto
sequences and series.

00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:39.450
So what is the
precise definition

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:41.145
of a sequence of real numbers?

00:43:46.040 --> 00:44:01.090
A sequence of real
numbers is precisely

00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:04.990
a function x from
the natural numbers

00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:08.440
into R, just a function.

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:11.270
It doesn't have to be bijective,
surjective, injective,

00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:11.770
anything.

00:44:11.770 --> 00:44:14.140
It's just a function from
the natural numbers to R.

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:18.430
So that's precisely what a
sequence of real numbers is.

00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:22.060
Now, we typically don't think
of a sequence as a function.

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:24.070
In fact, we don't even
use that notation.

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:41.280
We denote x of n by x
sub n and the associated

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:51.900
sequence by this curly brackets,
n equals 1 to infinity.

00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:58.770
Or we might not even write the
n equals 1 to infinity part

00:44:58.770 --> 00:45:01.470
or just start listing them.

00:45:05.450 --> 00:45:12.870
All right, so let me
quickly say that although--

00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:19.170
so again, a sequence,
unambiguously defined,

00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:22.320
is a function from the
natural numbers to real.

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:25.380
So don't confuse
this with a set.

00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:26.850
A sequence is not a set.

00:45:29.530 --> 00:45:35.650
So think of a sequence,
even though again it's

00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:40.720
defined as a function, as
just an infinite listing

00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:43.330
of elements of R--

00:45:43.330 --> 00:45:45.850
one element, the first
element, the second element,

00:45:45.850 --> 00:45:48.700
the third element, and so on.

00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:50.620
And they don't have
to be different.

00:45:50.620 --> 00:46:02.290
So for example, 1, 1, 1, 1, that
is a perfectly good sequence.

00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:04.130
In terms of what
is the function,

00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:08.840
this is x of n
equals 1 for all n.

00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:11.620
But again, I will not
think of really a sequence

00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:13.870
as a function.

00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:19.450
Just as we never thought about
functions as subsets of--

00:46:19.450 --> 00:46:23.350
as certain subsets of the
Cartesian product of two sets,

00:46:23.350 --> 00:46:30.095
you should really think of these
as just a list of real numbers.

00:46:30.095 --> 00:46:31.720
And when we refer to
them, we'll either

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:34.360
write them like that
or with curly brackets

00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:37.568
around an expression
for x sub n.

00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:48.755
So for example, if I
were to write this,

00:46:48.755 --> 00:47:00.260
this means this is the sequence
given by 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5,

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:00.920
and so on.

00:47:05.530 --> 00:47:06.030
OK.

00:47:54.400 --> 00:48:00.650
So here's another definition.

00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:04.570
So a sequence is bounded
if, in some sense,

00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:08.180
it doesn't run off to
arbitrarily large values.

00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:28.330
So sequence x sub n is
bounded if there exists

00:48:28.330 --> 00:48:30.760
some real number b
bigger than or equal

00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:39.310
to 0 such that for all n
in the natural numbers xn

00:48:39.310 --> 00:48:43.900
is less than or equal
to b in absolute value.

00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:50.140
So again, for example, if
we take a look back at both

00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:52.780
of those two sequences--

00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:58.400
1, 1, 1, and the
sequence 1 over n--

00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:02.970
these are bounded.

00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:03.470
Why?

00:49:03.470 --> 00:49:04.910
Because every element in this--

00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:14.000
I shouldn't say element, but
every entry in this sequence

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.140
is equal to 1.

00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:16.910
So it's bounded by 1.

00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:21.980
And every entry in this sequence
is less than or equal to 1.

00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:23.900
So it's bounded by
1 in absolute value.

00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:24.990
It's also positive.

00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:27.280
So they're both bounded.

00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:35.680
Another example is the
sequence minus 1 to the n.

00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:41.530
So I'll write equals,
although this shouldn't-- this

00:49:41.530 --> 00:49:42.530
doesn't mean anything.

00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:45.490
I'm just going to write it--

00:49:45.490 --> 00:49:49.260
write it-- or start listing
the entries-- minus 1,

00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:54.280
1, minus 1, 1, minus 1, 1.

00:49:54.280 --> 00:50:01.990
This is also bounded because
the absolute value of minus 1

00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:02.830
to the n is 1.

00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:06.470
So that's bounded
by 1 for all n.

00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:07.820
So what's a non-example?

00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:20.800
The sequence n-- in
other words, this

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:26.960
is the sequence 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, and so on.

00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:34.240
Now, precisely why is it un--
so I should say this is bounded.

00:50:38.530 --> 00:50:48.390
And otherwise, I'll refer to x
sub n as unbounded, unbounded.

00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:53.520
So why is it unbounded?

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:56.670
Because the entries are getting
larger and larger in size.

00:50:59.350 --> 00:51:02.650
But if I were to ask
you to prove this,

00:51:02.650 --> 00:51:05.020
you would have to show--

00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:07.510
and this is also a
good first exercise--

00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:10.390
what does it mean
to be unbounded.

00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:13.870
So I said this at one
point, that if you

00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:17.290
come across a reasonably
interesting definition,

00:51:17.290 --> 00:51:21.370
you should look up or try
to come up with examples.

00:51:21.370 --> 00:51:23.740
And typically, when you
do come up with examples,

00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:25.600
you should come up
with non-examples.

00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:30.320
And what that requires you to
do is negate the definition.

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:34.420
What does it mean for
something to not be that?

00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:39.280
So even though I'm saying
that if it's not bounded

00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:41.050
I call it unbounded,
I haven't actually

00:51:41.050 --> 00:51:43.750
written a mathematical
statement to this effect

00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:45.470
on what this means.

00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:50.240
So let me make this
right here as a remark.

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:58.560
So a sequence is
unbounded, so if it doesn't

00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:00.070
satisfy that definition.

00:52:00.070 --> 00:52:02.460
So we need to negate
this definition.

00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:05.910
The definition says
this is bounded

00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:09.450
if there exists a b bigger
than or equal to 0 such

00:52:09.450 --> 00:52:12.480
that this holds for all n.

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:16.020
Now, when I negate a there
exists, that becomes a for all.

00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:19.960
And when I negate a for all,
that becomes a there exists.

00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:23.410
And then I negate
this condition.

00:52:23.410 --> 00:52:30.420
So the sequence is unbounded
if for all b bigger than

00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:37.080
or equal to 0 there exists
a natural number in n

00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:42.840
such that xn in absolute
value is bigger than b.

00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:52.800
Now, using this-- so
this is-- if you like,

00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:54.630
you can take that as
a second definition.

00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:57.870
Or it's not really a definition,
since it's just the negation

00:52:57.870 --> 00:52:59.160
of the first definition.

00:53:02.490 --> 00:53:04.710
Why is this set unbounded?

00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:07.200
Because of the
Archimedean property.

00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:15.820
So now, I'm giving you a
little short proof on why

00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:18.760
this sequence is unbounded.

00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:23.830
Let b be bigger
than or equal to 0.

00:53:23.830 --> 00:53:27.730
By the Archimedean
property, there

00:53:27.730 --> 00:53:34.030
exists a natural number
n such that n is bigger

00:53:34.030 --> 00:53:37.600
than b, which is
exactly what we wanted

00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:47.270
to prove because, in this case,
x sub n is n, is unbounded.

00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:09.640
OK, now, what does
it mean for us

00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:11.140
to have a limit of a sequence?

00:54:11.140 --> 00:54:14.272
What does a limit
of a sequence mean?

00:54:14.272 --> 00:54:15.730
What does it mean
for a real number

00:54:15.730 --> 00:54:17.950
to be the limit of a sequence?

00:54:21.293 --> 00:54:23.710
What does it mean for a sequence
to converge to something?

00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:41.000
So the sequence x sub n
converges to a real number

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:46.670
x in R if the following
condition is satisfied--

00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:55.760
if for every epsilon positive,
there exists a natural number

00:54:55.760 --> 00:55:01.940
capital M such that
for all n bigger

00:55:01.940 --> 00:55:08.270
than or equal to capital M
xn minus x absolute value

00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:10.112
is less than epsilon.

00:55:10.112 --> 00:55:11.570
Now, remember the
absolute value is

00:55:11.570 --> 00:55:13.153
meant to be something
like a distance.

00:55:13.153 --> 00:55:14.900
So what does this statement say?

00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:18.590
This says if I give you a little
bit of tolerance, epsilon,

00:55:18.590 --> 00:55:21.890
and you go far enough
out in the sequence,

00:55:21.890 --> 00:55:29.600
then the distance between that
entry in the sequence and x

00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:31.490
are very close to each other.

00:55:36.130 --> 00:55:40.030
Let me finish stating the
rest of this definition

00:55:40.030 --> 00:55:42.610
and we'll do a little
more discussion.

00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:57.660
If a sequence converges,
we say it's convergent.

00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:10.280
Otherwise, we say
it's divergent.

00:56:16.540 --> 00:56:19.750
So all right, let me draw--

00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:24.610
let me draw a little picture
of what this is meant to be.

00:56:24.610 --> 00:56:31.570
So the real numbers,
it was this--

00:56:31.570 --> 00:56:35.510
I mean, it is this
unique ordered field

00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:37.160
with the least upper
bound property.

00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:40.130
But when you think
about the real numbers,

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:42.410
think of it as you've
always thought about it,

00:56:42.410 --> 00:56:44.790
as just the real number line.

00:56:44.790 --> 00:56:48.870
So what does this
definition mean?

00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:56.600
It means that a sequence
converges to some

00:56:56.600 --> 00:57:02.710
x if for every epsilon
I can do the following.

00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:03.530
If I look at--

00:57:12.130 --> 00:57:22.250
if I give you an epsilon and you
go on either side of x epsilon

00:57:22.250 --> 00:57:27.500
amount, then you should be
able to find a capital M so

00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:34.100
that if you look at entries
in your sequence x sub n for n

00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:37.980
bigger than or equal to
M they're in this guy.

00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:43.640
So then I should have x sub
M there, x sub M plus 1,

00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:45.560
x sub M plus 2.

00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:48.560
And in general, x sub
n should be in there,

00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:50.930
as long as n is bigger
than or equal to M.

00:57:50.930 --> 00:57:57.300
So I should be able to do
this for every epsilon.

00:57:57.300 --> 00:57:59.900
So for any amount of
tolerance epsilon,

00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:03.560
you should be able to go far
enough out in the sequence

00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:08.330
that all entries
in that sequence

00:58:08.330 --> 00:58:12.280
are within this tolerance of x.

00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:48.550
I mean, although this is a
picture of what the definition

00:58:48.550 --> 00:58:50.740
means, how should you--

00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:58.640
I mean, you've probably
gotten plenty of experience

00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:01.430
with sequences when you
were doing calculus.

00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:04.490
But what does this mean loosely?

00:59:04.490 --> 00:59:09.290
It means if I look close to x,
some little interval containing

00:59:09.290 --> 00:59:13.730
x, then all of the sequence, all
of the elements of the sequence

00:59:13.730 --> 00:59:15.755
should be eventually in this--

00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:19.840
in this little interval.

00:59:22.510 --> 00:59:24.430
Or another way to
think about it is

00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:33.280
that as I go on in the sequence,
the entries are getting closer

00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:40.960
and closer and closer to
x Now, the way one makes

00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:46.420
these last two intuitive
statements precise

00:59:46.420 --> 00:59:48.850
is via this definition.

00:59:48.850 --> 00:59:52.780
The closer and closer
part is encapsulated

00:59:52.780 --> 00:59:56.050
in this for all epsilon part.

00:59:56.050 --> 01:00:00.700
And eventually getting closer
and closer means for all n

01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:02.260
bigger than or
equal to capital M.

01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:04.870
As long as I go far enough
out in the sequence,

01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:07.420
they're getting close to x.

01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:09.445
So I hope that's pretty clear.

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:46.750
All right, so again,
we have a definition.

01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:52.790
And it's reasonably interesting.

01:00:52.790 --> 01:00:56.840
So we should do examples,
and then also negate it.

01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:00.280
But before I do
either of those, I

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:03.310
do want to just prove
a very simple fact

01:01:03.310 --> 01:01:07.870
about convergent
sequences, namely

01:01:07.870 --> 01:01:12.670
that if I have a sequence
which converges to x, then x

01:01:12.670 --> 01:01:15.640
is the only thing that
sequence can converge to.

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:19.750
I cannot have a convergent
sequence which converges to two

01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:20.470
different things.

01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:22.780
Like I said, if you
go by this intuition

01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:26.080
that eventually the
x sub n's are getting

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:28.900
closer and closer and
closer to x, well,

01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:31.090
then there's no way they
can be also getting closer

01:01:31.090 --> 01:01:34.733
to something other than x.

01:01:34.733 --> 01:01:36.400
So I just want to
prove that real quick.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:40.150
And then we'll do examples and
a negation of this definition.

01:01:43.531 --> 01:01:46.200
So the following theorem--

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:52.170
and so I'm going to state
first the theorem that

01:01:52.170 --> 01:01:54.030
has nothing to do
with sequences,

01:01:54.030 --> 01:01:59.640
but is a nice way if you want
to show two things are equal.

01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:01.587
You can show they're
smaller than anything.

01:02:01.587 --> 01:02:03.420
So the first theorem
that I'm going to state

01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:15.120
is if x and y are in R and
all epsilon positive x minus y

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:21.420
is less than epsilon,
then x equals y.

01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:23.010
This is not a
surprising statement.

01:02:23.010 --> 01:02:27.300
If I have x and y and
the distance between them

01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:29.970
is arbitrarily small, then
they have to be the same thing.

01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:34.710
So what's the proof?

01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:47.700
Suppose xy is in R. And for
all epsilon positive, x minus y

01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:48.700
is less than epsilon.

01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:50.250
So now, I want to
prove x equals y.

01:02:50.250 --> 01:02:56.460
So let's assume that this
does not hold and arrive

01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:57.370
at a contradiction.

01:02:57.370 --> 01:02:59.920
So this is a short
proof by contradiction.

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:03.300
Suppose x does not equal y.

01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:13.360
Then remember we proved that
the absolute value of something

01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:17.800
is 0 if and only if
that thing is equal to 0

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:19.510
and it's always non-negative.

01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:22.930
So x not equal to y means the
absolute value of x minus y

01:03:22.930 --> 01:03:24.670
is less than-- is bigger than 0.

01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:32.320
Then by this
assumption, for epsilon

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:36.040
equal to x minus
y over 2, I get--

01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:45.730
which implies if I just
subtract that over, x minus y

01:03:45.730 --> 01:03:46.720
is less than 0.

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:52.150
So 1/2 is less than 0 or--

01:03:52.150 --> 01:03:53.980
and that's a very
false statement.

01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:56.230
We've already proven that
the absolute value is always

01:03:56.230 --> 01:03:57.970
non-negative.

01:03:57.970 --> 01:04:03.580
So if I have two real
numbers that are arbitrarily

01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:07.030
close to each other, then
they have to be the same.

01:04:07.030 --> 01:04:11.330
I'm going to use this
theorem to prove that--

01:04:11.330 --> 01:04:14.530
I don't know why
I put a 1 there--

01:04:14.530 --> 01:04:22.170
why limits-- and I have not
said that's what we call x--

01:04:22.170 --> 01:04:26.490
but why a convergent sequence
can only converge to one thing.

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:33.580
So here is the statement
of the second theorem.

01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:40.960
If x sub n is a sequence
and it converges

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:49.270
to x and it also converges
to y, then x equals y.

01:04:49.270 --> 01:04:55.625
So a convergent sequence can
only converge to one thing.

01:04:55.625 --> 01:04:57.500
And again, like I said,
there should be clear

01:04:57.500 --> 01:05:03.680
because what's happening is if
I have two things that are not

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:05.990
equal and x sub
n converges to x,

01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:10.100
that means as long as I go far
enough out in the sequence,

01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:16.340
they're supposed to be here in
this small interval around x.

01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:20.750
Well, if they're supposed
to be converging to y,

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:22.340
if I go far enough
out, they're also

01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:28.270
supposed to be over here as
long as I go far enough out.

01:05:28.270 --> 01:05:33.200
But you can't be in two
places at once ever.

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:35.800
And so that's why
x must equal y.

01:05:43.130 --> 01:05:44.780
Although, I suppose
that now we're

01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:48.530
doing all the classes
online, some are recorded.

01:05:48.530 --> 01:05:54.040
So you can be two places at
once, but at least not here.

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:56.950
OK, so we're going
to use this theorem

01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:58.360
to prove this statement.

01:06:02.910 --> 01:06:15.110
Suppose-- converges to x and y.

01:06:15.110 --> 01:06:17.840
And I want to verify that
for all epsilon positive

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:19.857
the absolute value of
x minus y is less than

01:06:19.857 --> 01:06:20.690
or equal to epsilon.

01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:30.310
Now, remember if I'm proving
something for all epsilon,

01:06:30.310 --> 01:06:35.860
I have to-- that means I do
it for arbitrary epsilon.

01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:39.760
You get points just for setting
let epsilon be positive.

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:42.640
OK, now, I want to show the
absolute value of x minus y

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:44.440
is less than or
equal to epsilon.

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:46.900
And we're basically going to
do the argument that I just

01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:47.400
erased.

01:06:49.870 --> 01:07:03.400
So since x sub n
converges to x, that

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:10.860
implies that there exists a
natural number M1 such that

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:14.400
for all n bigger
than or equal to M1,

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:19.140
x sub n minus x is less
than epsilon over 2.

01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:20.502
Why the epsilon over 2?

01:07:20.502 --> 01:07:21.585
You'll see, magic happens.

01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:37.310
And since x sub
n converges to y,

01:07:37.310 --> 01:07:42.350
thus this implies that there
exists an M2 natural number

01:07:42.350 --> 01:07:47.990
such that for all n bigger
than or equal to M2--

01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:49.670
so again, this is
the part that says

01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:52.710
as long as I go far enough out
s sub n has to be close to x.

01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:54.260
Now, this is the
part that says as

01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:58.630
long as I go far enough out x
sub n has to be close to y--

01:07:58.630 --> 01:08:03.580
so that for all n bigger than
or equal to M2 x sub n minus y

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:05.290
is less than epsilon over 2.

01:08:08.690 --> 01:08:20.319
Then since the sum M1 plus--
these are both natural numbers.

01:08:20.319 --> 01:08:28.300
This is bigger than
or equal to M1 and M2.

01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:33.640
This implies-- now, I'm going
to use these two inequalities

01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:36.550
and the triangle inequality.

01:08:36.550 --> 01:08:39.340
Then if I look at the
absolute value of x minus y,

01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:41.680
this is equal to
the absolute value

01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:46.404
of x minus x sub n
plus x sub n minus--

01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:58.420
so let me-- not x sub n, but
x sub M1 plus M2 plus x sub M1

01:08:58.420 --> 01:08:59.139
plus M2.

01:09:03.319 --> 01:09:05.060
Now, by the triangle
inequality, this

01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:15.460
is less than or equal to x
M2 plus M1 plus M2 minus y.

01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:19.189
Now, this is less
than epsilon over 2

01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:22.910
because M1 plus M2 is
bigger than or equal to M1.

01:09:26.439 --> 01:09:29.390
And for the same reason,
since plus M1 plus M2

01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:32.359
is bigger than or equal to
M2, this is less than epsilon

01:09:32.359 --> 01:09:33.514
over 2.

01:09:33.514 --> 01:09:35.750
Ah, now you see why I
divided both of those

01:09:35.750 --> 01:09:39.330
by 2 because when I add
them up, I get epsilon.

01:09:39.330 --> 01:09:42.439
So I've shown that for
every epsilon positive,

01:09:42.439 --> 01:09:45.169
the absolute value of x
minus y is less than epsilon.

01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:03.570
And therefore, by the theorem
that I proved a minute ago,

01:10:03.570 --> 01:10:04.380
x equals y.

01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:14.000
Why did I state that theorem?

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.320
Because I want to use notation.

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:18.440
And I want this notation
to be already apparent

01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:19.550
that it's consistent.

01:10:22.710 --> 01:10:26.500
And I'm going to
use terminology.

01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:37.080
So I mean, this is not
really a new definition.

01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:38.430
It's just some terminology.

01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:57.745
We call x the limit
of the sequence.

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:07.090
Now, the fact that I've shown
only that there's only one

01:11:07.090 --> 01:11:10.360
guy that a sequence
can converge to

01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:12.520
is why I get to use
the word "the--"

01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:15.700
so not we call x a
limit of x sub n.

01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:19.720
It's the limit because there's
only one, if one exists--

01:11:26.050 --> 01:11:32.560
and write x equals limit as n
goes to infinity of x sub n.

01:11:39.650 --> 01:11:46.582
OK, so let's pause on negating
the definition of what

01:11:46.582 --> 01:11:48.290
it means for a sequence
to be convergent.

01:11:48.290 --> 01:11:50.870
And let's do a
couple of examples

01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:54.650
of convergent sequences,
proving that they

01:11:54.650 --> 01:11:57.350
are convergent sequences
and computing what they--

01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:02.740
and at least proving
that these sequences

01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:06.970
do converge to the limit
that I'm telling you.

01:12:06.970 --> 01:12:11.860
So for example, let's look
at the constant sequence

01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:19.225
x sub n equals 1 for all N. So
that's the sequence 1, 1, 1,

01:12:19.225 --> 01:12:20.680
and so on.

01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:26.305
Then I'm just going to
write 1, not x sub n.

01:12:26.305 --> 01:12:30.310
The limit as n goes to
infinity of 1 equals 1.

01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:36.490
This proof is not
very enlightening,

01:12:36.490 --> 01:12:39.880
but I'll show you how it goes.

01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:41.680
So you're supposed to show--

01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:42.950
what does this mean?

01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:44.750
This means for every
epsilon positive,

01:12:44.750 --> 01:12:46.750
there exist a natural
number capital M such

01:12:46.750 --> 01:12:50.650
that if I'm bigger than
capital M, this minus the limit

01:12:50.650 --> 01:12:52.310
should be less than epsilon.

01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:53.930
So let epsilon be positive.

01:12:53.930 --> 01:12:58.120
I have to now come
up with a capital M

01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:00.730
so that x sub n minus
x is less than epsilon

01:13:00.730 --> 01:13:03.550
whenever little n is bigger
than or equal to capital M.

01:13:03.550 --> 01:13:05.712
So I'm going to choose
capital M to be 1.

01:13:05.712 --> 01:13:07.045
I can do that for this sequence.

01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:18.620
Then if n is bigger
than or equal to M

01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:24.120
and I look at the n-th
entry in the sequence,

01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:28.280
well, this is just
1 minus 1 equals 0.

01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:32.270
And that's less than epsilon.

01:13:32.270 --> 01:13:38.300
So not very enlightening
because capital M equals 1

01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:40.110
is good enough.

01:13:40.110 --> 01:13:43.070
So let's do something
a little more.

01:13:43.070 --> 01:13:47.480
So how about the limit as
n goes to infinity of 1

01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:49.040
over n equals 0?

01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:55.595
So let's do a proof of this.

01:13:59.730 --> 01:14:04.050
Again, I'm supposed to be
proving this epsilon statement

01:14:04.050 --> 01:14:12.210
in the definition in order to
be able to state this, which

01:14:12.210 --> 01:14:13.990
is for every epsilon statement.

01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:16.990
So I start the proof off
with let epsilon be positive.

01:14:16.990 --> 01:14:18.480
Now, I have to find--

01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:22.110
I have to tell you how to
choose capital M to ensure

01:14:22.110 --> 01:14:24.120
that little n bigger than
or equal to capital M

01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:29.310
implies x sub n minus 0, in
this case, is less than epsilon.

01:14:29.310 --> 01:14:37.050
So I will say choose capital
M natural number such

01:14:37.050 --> 01:14:43.050
that m is bigger
than 1 over epsilon.

01:14:43.050 --> 01:14:45.827
In fact, I'm not going
to write it that way.

01:14:45.827 --> 01:14:47.160
I'm going to write it this way--

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:52.180
1 over M is less than epsilon.

01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:53.730
And Why Can I do this?

01:14:53.730 --> 01:15:00.270
Why can I find such a natural
number that satisfies this?

01:15:00.270 --> 01:15:03.420
And you can't just insert
statements into your proof--

01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:08.590
choose capital M to satisfy
the unicorn property--

01:15:08.590 --> 01:15:14.930
and not clarify
why you can choose

01:15:14.930 --> 01:15:19.850
such a natural number that
satisfies the unicorn property.

01:15:19.850 --> 01:15:22.160
I can do this by the
Archimedean property.

01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:24.260
This is equivalently
stating that I

01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:27.200
can find a natural
number M so that n

01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:28.730
is bigger than 1
over epsilon, what

01:15:28.730 --> 01:15:31.670
I had written there originally.

01:15:31.670 --> 01:15:32.960
So let me write it this way--

01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:41.760
such an M exists by the
Archimedean property

01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:43.650
of the natural numbers.

01:15:43.650 --> 01:15:45.960
I'll say that a few
times if I have to

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:51.890
or to clarify why certain
natural numbers satisfying

01:15:51.890 --> 01:15:53.318
certain properties exist.

01:15:53.318 --> 01:15:54.860
And then at one
point, I'll just stop

01:15:54.860 --> 01:15:57.235
because it should be clear
that I've done it enough times

01:15:57.235 --> 01:16:00.920
you know how or why
something does exist.

01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:09.300
OK, so I choose a natural
number and a natural number

01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:10.950
M so that I have this.

01:16:10.950 --> 01:16:17.600
Now, I need to show you
that this number works.

01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:25.100
So let n be bigger
than capital M. Then

01:16:25.100 --> 01:16:29.150
if I look at x sub n minus my
proposed limit, which is 0--

01:16:29.150 --> 01:16:31.760
so I look at 1 minus n 0--

01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:34.130
this is equal to just 1 over n.

01:16:34.130 --> 01:16:37.040
Since little n is bigger
than or equal to capital M,

01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:42.830
this is less than or
equal to capital M, which

01:16:42.830 --> 01:16:43.715
is less than epsilon.

01:16:47.550 --> 01:16:52.440
And therefore, I've proven
what I wanted to prove.

01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:54.150
So how do these--

01:16:54.150 --> 01:16:58.330
if I just give you a sequence
and I ask you to prove that--

01:16:58.330 --> 01:17:01.380
so this is some discussion.

01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:03.310
How do you come up
with these proofs?

01:17:03.310 --> 01:17:06.727
How should the proof
typically look?

01:17:06.727 --> 01:17:07.560
If I want to prove--

01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:18.840
equals L or x, what's the
proof of that look like?

01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:22.530
It should always-- so the
proof should be let epsilon

01:17:22.530 --> 01:17:23.650
be positive.

01:17:23.650 --> 01:17:27.030
And then maybe you need
to do some explaining.

01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:34.350
And then you'll say choose
M so that something.

01:17:38.430 --> 01:17:44.150
And that such an
M exists probably

01:17:44.150 --> 01:17:51.050
will be explained there
or in the same sentence.

01:17:51.050 --> 01:17:52.640
And then the next
part of the proof

01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:56.840
should be showing that
this capital M works.

01:17:56.840 --> 01:18:02.570
So then if n is bigger
than or equal to capital M,

01:18:02.570 --> 01:18:04.850
then you should
show that it works

01:18:04.850 --> 01:18:08.240
by looking at x sub
n minus x and doing

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:12.920
a calculation or inequalities
and arriving at this being less

01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:15.320
than epsilon, which is what
you're wanting to prove.

01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:19.670
You're wanting, in the end, to
verify this definition, which

01:18:19.670 --> 01:18:22.370
says for every epsilon,
you can find a capital M

01:18:22.370 --> 01:18:24.470
so that I get this.

01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:27.390
So in a proof, you
are carrying that out.

01:18:27.390 --> 01:18:29.990
You're saying for
epsilon positive,

01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:32.450
I choose M so that this happens.

01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:47.840
Now, how do you--

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:50.520
how do you come up
with such a capital M?

01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:52.100
So again, this is
just discussion.

01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:54.560
And maybe we won't get
to any more examples.

01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:59.890
I'll just finish
this discussion,

01:18:59.890 --> 01:19:01.360
and then we'll call it a day.

01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:03.070
How do you come up
with such a capital M?

01:19:03.070 --> 01:19:06.790
How did I come up with M?

01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:08.800
Why did I choose M in this way?

01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:12.280
In the end, you
can see it here, is

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:16.390
that I chose it because
if I fiddle around

01:19:16.390 --> 01:19:21.710
with the thing I want to bound,
I ended up with 1 over n, which

01:19:21.710 --> 01:19:27.140
I can control and make
it smaller than epsilon.

01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:29.810
So typically, how do
you find capital M?

01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:40.550
So this is a discussion, I
guess, within a discussion.

01:19:43.930 --> 01:19:47.560
Typically, you'll take x sub n
minus x, your proposed limit.

01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:53.560
Maybe I give you a
sequence explicitly.

01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:58.450
Or maybe it's a expression
involving some other sequences.

01:19:58.450 --> 01:20:00.100
And you fiddle around with it.

01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:04.360
Maybe you write it differently,
or add and subtract something,

01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:08.290
or multiply it by
1 in a fancy way.

01:20:08.290 --> 01:20:12.520
And you'll get some
expression typically

01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:15.280
involving something involving n.

01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:29.270
And as long as this expression
involving n is simple enough,

01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:32.390
then you choose capital
M so that this thing

01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:34.080
is less than epsilon.

01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:37.310
Now, simple enough,
for example, 1 over n,

01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:40.430
I can choose capital M so
that this is less than epsilon

01:20:40.430 --> 01:20:42.970
by the Archimedean property.

01:20:42.970 --> 01:20:47.990
If, for example-- and
that's basically 1 over n,

01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:50.120
or 5 over n, or
something like that,

01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:55.460
that exhausts all the
simplest ones for now.

01:20:55.460 --> 01:20:57.920
But if, for example,
you ended up with 1

01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:03.350
over n squared
minus 3n plus 100,

01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:06.890
I would not say this is a
simple enough expression

01:21:06.890 --> 01:21:10.430
to be able to say choose
capital M so that this is less

01:21:10.430 --> 01:21:14.030
than epsilon without more
explanation than what I just

01:21:14.030 --> 01:21:14.720
gave here.

01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:25.900
And we'll do some more
examples next time

01:21:25.900 --> 01:21:30.010
to flesh this out
a little bit more.

01:21:30.010 --> 01:21:32.340
All right, so we'll stop there.
