This project aims to develop a robust captioning system specifically designed for instructional videos in the domain of mathematics. By leveraging OpenAI's Whisper model, we intend to generate precise, contextually relevant transcripts that are enriched through the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques.
