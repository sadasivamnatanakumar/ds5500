# Smart Captioning for Educational Videos using Generative AI
## Description
This project aims to develop a robust captioning system specifically designed for instructional videos in the domain of mathematics. By leveraging OpenAI's Whisper model, we intend to perform a comparative study of vanilla fine-tuning and layer freezing methods to see which one can improve upon the word error rate of baseline Whisper transcriptions and capture domain specific terminology.
