00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.900
The topic for today is going to be equations of planes.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:38.180
And how it relates how they relate to linear systems

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.080
and matrices as we have seen during Tuesday's lecture.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.520
So let's start again with equations of planes.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:59.980
So remember, we've seen briefly that an equation for a plane

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:14.280
is of a form AX plus BY plus CZ equals D, where A, B, C, and D

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.900
are just numbers.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.500
And so this expresses the condition for a point

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.160
that coordinates XYZ to be in the plane.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.400
And so an equation of this form defines a plane.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.880
So let's see how that works again.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.380
So let's start with an example.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.620
Let's say that we want to find an equation for a plane

00:01:44.580 --> 00:02:01.440
for the origin with normal vector, let's say, vector n equals,

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.160
let's say, the normal vector 1, 5, 10.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.480
So how do we find an equation of this plane?

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:21.920
Well, remember that we can get that equation by thinking

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.640
geometrically.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.580
So what's our thinking going to be?

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.580
Well, so we have the XYZ axis.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:43.080
And we have this vector n, 1, 5, 10.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.060
And it's supposed to be perpendicular to our plane.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.940
And our plane passes for the origin here.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:58.420
So we want to think of a plane that's perpendicular to this

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.720
vector.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.360
Well, when is a point in that plane?

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:11.580
Let's say we have a point P, a coordinate XYZ,

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.040
well, the condition for P to be in the plane

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.780
should be that we have a right angle here.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:31.480
OK, so P is in the plane whenever OP dot n is 0.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.780
And if we write that explicitly, well, vector OP has

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.360
components XYZ and has components 1, 5, 10.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:48.040
So that will give us x plus 5y plus 10z equals 0.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.820
That's the equation of our plane.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.080
Now, let's think about a slightly different problem.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.040
So let's do another problem.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.780
Let's try to find the equation of a plane

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:15.740
for a point P0, we've coordinates, say, 2, 1 minus 1.

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:22.320
And with normal vector, again, the same guy, 1, 5, 10.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.140
So how do we find an equation of this thing?

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.120
Well, we are going to use the same method.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.900
In fact, let's think first for a second.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.220
So I said we have a normal vector n.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.180
And it's going to be perpendicular to both planes

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.500
at the same time.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.280
So in fact, our two planes will be parallel to each other.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.400
The difference is, well, before we had a plane that

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.340
was perpendicular to n and passing for the origin.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.800
And now we have a new plane that's going to pass,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.980
well, not for the origin, but for maybe this point P0.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.340
And I don't know where it is.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.560
But let's say, for example, that P0 is here.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.140
Then I will just have to shift my plane

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.340
so that instead of passing for the origin,

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.520
it passes for this new point.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.860
So how are we going to do that?

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.620
Well, now for a point P to be in our new plane,

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.160
we need for vector no longer OP, but P0P

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.880
to be perpendicular to n.

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.360
So P is in this new plane.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:57.080
If the vector P0P is perpendicular to n,

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.280
and now let's think for a second, what's vector P0P?

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.720
Well, we take the coordinates of P and we subtract those of P0.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:15.620
So that should be x minus 2, y minus 1, and z plus 1.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.680
Dot product with 1, 5, 10 equals 0.

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:37.700
Let's expand this while we get x minus 2 plus 5 times y minus 1 plus 10 times z plus 1 equals 0.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:43.420
So let's put the constants on the other side.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:51.540
We get x plus 5y plus 10z equals, well, here we have minus 2 becomes 2,

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.200
minus 5 becomes 5, 10 becomes minus 10.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.040
I think we end up with negative 3.

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.160
So see, the only thing that changes between these two equations

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.300
is the constant term on the right hand side.

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:08.040
The thing that I call d.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.100
And the other common feature is that the coefficients of x, y, and z,

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.420
on 1, 5, and 10 correspond exactly to the normal vector.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.960
So that's something you should remember about planes.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.880
These coefficients here correspond exactly to a normal vector.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.100
And well, this constant term here roughly

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.600
measures how far, you know, when you move from,

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.020
so if you have a plane through the origin,

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.520
the right hand side will be 0.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:38.560
And if you move to a parallel plane,

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.560
then this number will become something else.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.300
So how actually could we have found that minus 3 more quickly?

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.180
Well, we know that the first part of the equation is like this.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:51.880
And we know something else.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.860
We know that the point p0 is in the plane.

00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:00.940
So if we plug the coordinates of p0 into this, well,

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:07.420
x is 2 plus 5 times 1 plus 10 times minus 1, we get minus 3.

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:11.360
So in fact, the number we should have here should be minus 3

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.240
so that p0 is a solution.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:20.500
So let me point out, so maybe I'll put a 1 here again.

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:28.360
So these three numbers, 1, 5, 10, are exactly the normal vector.

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:38.180
And one way that we can get this number here is by computing

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:41.320
the value of the left hand side.

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:50.820
At the point p0, we plug in the point p0 into the left hand side.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.180
Any questions about that?

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.040
No.

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:05.540
OK.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:10.600
By the way, I mean, of course, a plane doesn't have just one equation.

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:14.060
It has infinitely many equations because if I take instead say,

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:20.200
if I multiply everything by 2, 2x plus 10y plus 20z equals minus 6

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.620
is also an equation for this plane.

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:26.760
That's because, of course, we have normal vectors of all sizes.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.040
We can choose how big we make it.

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:41.120
So again, just to repeat the single most important thing here,

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:49.660
in the equation, ax plus by plus cz equals d,

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:58.280
the coefficients a, b, c give us actually a normal vector to the plane.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:07.360
So that's why, in fact, what matters to us mostly is finding the normal vector.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:12.020
And in particular, if you remember last time, I explained something about how we can find

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.620
normal vector to the plane if we know points in the plane.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:19.680
Namely, we can take the cross product of two vectors containing the plane.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:53.620
So let's just do an example to see if we completely understand what's going on.

00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:02.560
So let's say that I give you the vector with components 1, 2, negative 1.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.780
And I give you the plane x plus y plus 3z equals 5.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:14.980
So do you think that this vector is parallel to the plane, perpendicular to it, neighbor?

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:30.620
I'm starting to see a few votes.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:46.080
I see that most of you are answering number 2.

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.720
This vector is perpendicular to the plane.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.860
There are some other answers to it.

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:52.900
Well, let's try to figure it out.

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:01.620
Let's do the example.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.980
Say, v is 1, 2, negative 1.

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:12.160
And the plane is x plus y plus 3z equals 5.

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.960
So let's just throw that plane anywhere.

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:16.760
It doesn't really matter.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.100
Let's first get a normal vector out of it.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:32.860
Well, to get a normal vector to the plane, what I will do is I will take the coefficients of x, y, and z.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.060
So that's 1, 1, 3.

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:37.940
So 1, 1, 3 is perpendicular to the plane.

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:41.420
How do we get all the other vectors that perpendicular to the plane?

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:42.720
That are perpendicular to the plane.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:46.940
Well, all the perpendicular vectors are parallel to each other.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:53.900
That means that they are just obtained by maybe multiplying this guy by some number.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:58.800
2, 2, 6, for example, would still be perpendicular to the plane.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:03.280
1 half, 1 half, 3 halves is also perpendicular to the plane.

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.860
But now, see, these guys are not proportional to each other.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.540
So v is not perpendicular to the plane.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:28.620
So it's not perpendicular to the plane.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:34.660
Being perpendicular to the plane is the same as being parallel to its normal vector.

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:40.960
Now, what about testing if v is instead parallel to the plane?

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:44.440
Well, it's parallel to the plane if it's perpendicular to n.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:46.360
Well, let's check that.

00:13:55.280 --> 00:14:01.620
So let's try to see if it's perpendicular to n.

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:06.220
Well, let's do v dot n.

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:13.940
That's 1, 2, negative 1 dot 1, 1, 3.

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:21.140
If you get 1 plus 2 minus 3, that's 0.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:22.500
So yes.

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:38.980
So if it's perpendicular to n, means, maybe it's somewhere like that.

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:42.800
It's actually going to be parallel to the plane.

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.300
Any questions? Yes.

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:04.680
When you plug the vector into the plane equation, you get 0.

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.280
What is the difference between the two?

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:09.480
When you plug...

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:11.820
Let's see.

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:21.120
So if I plug the vector into the plane equation, so x 1 plus 2 minus 3,

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:23.240
well, the left hand side becomes 0.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:26.180
So it's not a solution of a plane equation.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:30.160
So I should say...

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.700
So there's two different things here.

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:42.000
One is the point we've coordinates 1, 2, minus 1 is not in the plane.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:51.280
So what that tells us is that if I put my vector v at the origin,

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:58.520
then the point here is not going to be in the plane.

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:02.900
On the other hand, you're right.

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.300
The left hand side evaluates to 0.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:10.060
What that means is if instead they had taken the plane x plus y plus 3 is equal 0,

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:11.380
then it would be inside.

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:17.780
And the plane x plus y, so this one is x plus y plus 3 is equal 5.

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:23.860
x plus y plus 3 is equal 0 would be a plane parallel to it, but for the origin.

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:30.980
So that would be another way to see that the vector is parallel to the plane.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.040
If we move the plane to a parallel plane for the origin,

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.200
then the endpoint of the vector is in the plane.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.640
That's another way to convince yourselves.

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:48.120
Any other questions?

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.660
Okay, so let's move on.

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:05.920
So last time we saw about matrices, we learned about matrices and linear systems.

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:12.120
So let's try to think now about linear systems in terms of equations of planes and intersections of planes.

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.900
I mean remember a linear system, it's a bunch of equations.

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:20.220
Let's say a three by three linear system, it's three different equations.

00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:23.020
Each of the equation is the equation of a plane.

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:28.220
So in fact, if we try to solve a system of equations,

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:32.080
that means actually we're trying to find a point that is on several planes at the same time.

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:38.060
So one more board here.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:49.540
So let's say that we have a three by three linear system.

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:55.020
And just to take an example,

00:17:55.020 --> 00:18:00.320
it doesn't really matter what I give you,

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:06.200
but let's say I give you x plus z equals one,

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:09.320
x plus y equals two,

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:15.500
x plus two y plus phase z equals three.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:20.900
What does this mean to solve this?

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:23.720
It means we want to find x, y, z,

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:26.080
which satisfy all of these conditions.

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:30.900
So let's just look at the first equation first.

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:35.640
Well, the first equation says our point should be on the plane, which has this equation.

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:40.560
Then the second equation says, oh, our point should also be on this plane.

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:46.100
So in fact, if you just look at the first two equations,

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:49.160
that means you have two planes.

00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:58.540
The solufans,

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.660
so these two equations

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:14.800
determine for you two planes and two planes intersect in a line.

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:25.380
Now, what happens with the third equation?

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:28.220
That's actually going to be a third plane.

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:33.020
So if we want to solve the first two equations,

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.500
we have to be on this line.

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.900
And if we want to solve the third one,

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:39.680
we also need to be on another plane.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:43.260
And in general, three planes intersect in a point,

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:45.960
because this line of intersection.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:00.700
So, okay.

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:03.680
So, three planes intersect in a point.

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:07.580
And one way to think about it is that the line with the first two points,

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:10.700
sorry, the line with the first two planes intersect,

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:13.400
meets the third plane in a point.

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:16.020
And that point is the solution to the linear system.

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:24.180
So, the line, let's say, formed by the,

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:28.820
so this is mathematical notation for the intersection between the first two planes,

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:36.300
intersects the third plane in a point.

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.260
Which is going to be the solution.

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:52.760
So, the solution, actually, how do we find it?

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:55.720
Well, one way is to draw pictures and try to figure out what the solution is.

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:58.840
But that's not how we do it in practice if we are given the equations.

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:05.800
The solution is given, sorry, so let me use matrix notation.

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:11.620
Remember, we saw on Tuesday that the solution to AX equals B

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:18.820
is given by X equals A inverse B.

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:25.480
And we get from here to here by multiplying on the left by A inverse.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:30.520
A inverse AX simplifies to X equals A inverse B.

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:34.940
And once again, it's A inverse B and not B A inverse.

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:38.840
If you try to set up the multiplication, B A inverse doesn't work.

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:40.180
The sizes are not compatible.

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:43.260
You can't multiply the other way around.

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:52.120
Okay, so that's pretty good.

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:53.620
Unless.

00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:58.900
Well, unless it doesn't work that way.

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:02.480
Okay, and what could go wrong?

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:06.160
Well, let's say that our first two planes do intersect nicely in the line.

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.980
But let's think about the third plane.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:13.880
Maybe the third plane does not intersect that line nicely in a point.

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:16.060
Maybe it's actually parallel to that line.

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:25.540
Okay, so let's try to think about this question for a second.

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.480
Oh, sorry, this is two thousand left.

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:36.920
So let's say that the set of solutions to a free by free linear system is not just one point.

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:42.260
So we don't have a unique solution that we can get this way.

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:43.860
What could happen?

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:44.900
What do you think could happen?

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:59.480
Okay, I see answers number three and five seem to be dominating.

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:02.900
There's also a bit of answer number one.

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:06.100
And in fact, these are pretty good answers.

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.840
I see when some of you figured out that you can answer one and three at the same time.

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:13.920
Or three and five at the same time.

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:18.580
I yet have to see somebody with free hands answer all three numbers at the same time.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:28.160
Okay, so indeed we'll see very soon that we could have either no solution, a line or a plane.

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:32.500
The other answers, well, two points, two solutions.

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:38.420
We will see is not actually a possibility because if you have two different solutions,

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:42.660
then the entire line through these two points is also going to be made of solutions.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:48.120
Etitrahedron is just there to, you know, I'm using you.

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:50.920
It's not actually a good answer to that question.

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:54.500
It's not very likely that you will get a tetrahedron out of intersecting planes.

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:56.820
A plane isn't it possible.

00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:59.360
And I don't know if it's still okay for a few more minutes.

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:04.180
But we're going to get to the bottom of this and then we will know.

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:08.140
Okay, so let's try to figure out what can happen.

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:12.840
So let me go back to my picture.

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:21.300
And so I had my first two planes, if I did them in a line, and now I have my third plane.

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:27.120
And maybe my third plane is actually parallel to the line, but doesn't pass through it.

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:33.040
Well, then I'm afraid that there's no solutions.

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:38.620
Okay, because to solve the system of equations, I need to be in the first two planes.

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:41.380
So that means I need to be in that vertical line.

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:45.540
Well, that line was supposed to be a red, but I guess it doesn't really show up as red.

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:51.600
And it also needs to be in the third plane, but the line and the plane are parallel to each other.

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:53.900
There's just no place where they intersect.

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:57.260
Okay, so there's no way to solve all the equations.

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:04.940
On the other hand, the other thing that could happen is that actually the line is contained in the plane.

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:13.820
And then, well, it means any point on that line will actually solve automatically the third equation.

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:21.840
Okay, so if you try solving a system that looks like this by hand, what you will notice, you know,

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:28.660
if you do substitution, eliminations, and so on, what you will notice is that, you know, after you've dealt with two of the equations,

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:33.680
the third one here would actually turn out to be the same as what you got out of the first two.

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:38.100
It doesn't give you any additional information. It's as if you had only two equations.

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:48.820
The previous case would be when actually the third equation contradicts something that you can get out of the first two.

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:54.540
For example, maybe out of the first two you got x plus z equals one, and the third equation is x plus z equals two.

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:56.780
Well, it can't be one and two at the same time.

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:05.100
Maybe another way to say it is that this picture is one where you can get, you know, out of the equations,

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:07.640
you get a number equals a different number that's impossible.

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:15.400
And that picture is one where out of the equations you get zero equals zero, which is certainly true, but isn't very useful equation.

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.180
So you can't actually finish solving.

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:23.240
Okay, so let me write that down.

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:43.700
So unless the third plane, I say it is parallel to the line where p1 and p2 intersect.

00:26:53.900 --> 00:27:10.380
So then there's two subcases if the line of intersections of p1 and p2 is actually contained in p3 in the third plane,

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:13.700
then we have infinitely many solutions.

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:28.560
Namely, any point on the line will automatically solve the third equation.

00:27:47.920 --> 00:28:09.340
Now, the other possibility, the other subcase is if the line of intersection of p1 and p2 is parallel to p3 and not contained in it.

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:21.320
Then we get no solutions.

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:34.040
Okay, so again, just two for you, just once again.

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:38.880
When we have the first two planes, they give us a line.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:46.120
And now, depending on what happens to that line in relation to the third plane, various situations can happen.

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:55.800
So if the third line hits the third plane in a point, then that's going to be our solution.

00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:04.520
And if that line instead is parallel to the third plane, well, if it's parallel and outside of it, then we have no solution.

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:11.860
If it's parallel and contains in it, actually, then we have infinitely many solutions.

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:28.200
Okay, so going back to our list of possibilities, that means, well, let's see what can happen.

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:36.860
So no solution, well, we've seen that happens when the line where the first two planes intersect is parallel to the third one, that exists.

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.140
Two points, well, that didn't come up.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:55.020
Okay, and as I said, the problem is if the line of intersection of the first two planes actually has two points that are in the third plane, well, then that means actually the entire line must also be in the third plane.

00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:59.880
So if you have two solutions, then you have more than two, actually.

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:03.440
In fact, you have infinitely many, and we've seen that can happen.

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:07.400
Okay, Tettra Headron still doesn't look very promising.

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:12.340
What about a plane?

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:21.200
Well, that's a case that I didn't explain because I've been assuming that P1 and P2 are different planes and they intersect in the line.

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:29.660
But in fact, well, they could be parallel, in which case we already have no solution to the first two equations, or they could be the same plane.

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:37.480
And now if a third plane is also the same plane, you know, if all three planes are the same plane, well, then you have a plane of solutions.

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:41.800
You know, if I give you three times the same equation, that is a linear system.

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:44.040
It's not a very interesting one, but it is a linear system.

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:48.280
Okay, and I don't know is no longer.

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:51.540
A solution either.

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:56.980
Okay, any questions? Yes?

00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:04.340
One of the two that you have to do is to get the x plus y plus d is equal to 1 as a plus 2 is 3.

00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:06.820
Okay, so that's a very good question.

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:11.860
The question is what is the geometric significance of an equation like x plus y plus 0?

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:15.260
Say this one equals to 1, 2, 3, or something else.

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:22.660
Well, if the equation is x plus y plus 0, it means that our plane is passing through the origin.

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:26.860
And then if we change the constant, it means we move to a parallel plane.

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:35.360
So the first guess that you might have is that this number on the right hand side is the distance between the origin and the plane.

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:37.140
It tells us how far from the origin we are.

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:39.840
That is not quite true.

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:47.120
In fact, that would be true if the coefficients here form the unit vector.

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:49.880
Then this guy would just be the distance to the origin.

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:56.940
Otherwise, you have to actually scale by the length of this normal vector.

00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:01.800
And I think there's a problem in the notes that will show you exactly how this works.

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:06.980
But you should think of it roughly as how much have we moved the plane away from the origin.

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:14.420
That's the meaning of this last term, D, that's in the right hand side of the equation.

00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:22.520
Okay.

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:37.840
So let's try to think about what exactly this case, you know, how do we detect now in which situation we are?

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:39.900
Because that's all very nice in the picture.

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:44.160
But you know, it's difficult to draw planes.

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:50.660
In fact, when I draw these pictures, I'm always very careful not to actually try to pretend to draw an actual plane given by an equation.

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:52.720
Or when I do, then it blatantly falls.

00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:56.160
It's difficult to draw a plane correctly.

00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:00.500
So instead, let's try to think about it in terms of matrices.

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:03.620
In particular, what's wrong with this?

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:07.440
You know, why can't we always say the solution is x equals a inverse b?

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:18.060
Well, so the point is actually you cannot always invert the matrix.

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:18.920
Okay.

00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:32.620
So recall, we've seen this formula that a inverse is one of our determinant of a times the adjoint matrix.

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:36.200
And, well, we've learned how to compute this thing.

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:41.260
Remember, we had to take minors, then flip some signs, and then transpose.

00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:44.160
Well, that step we can always do.

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:45.540
We can always do these calculations.

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:49.680
But, at the end, we have to divide by the determinant.

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:53.440
Well, that's fine if a determinant is not zero.

00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:56.100
But if a determinant is zero, then certainly we cannot do that.

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:07.380
So, in fact, what I didn't mention last time is that the matrix is invertible, that means it has an inverse.

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:13.680
Exactly when it's determinant is not zero.

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:17.120
Okay, so that's something we should remember.

00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:24.880
So if a determinant is not zero, then we can use our method to find the inverse,

00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:27.940
and then we can solve using this method.

00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:30.400
If not, then not.

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:31.460
Yes?

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:38.480
That's correct.

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:42.980
So what I'm saying is we can invert the matrix A if a determinant is not zero.

00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:49.800
And if you look again at the method that we saw last time, so first we had to compute this adjoint matrix.

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:51.880
And these operations we can always do.

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:55.280
If we are given a free by free matrix, we can always compute the adjoint.

00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:59.540
And then the last step to find the inverse was to divide by the determinant.

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:03.180
And that we can only do if a determinant is not zero.

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:08.260
So if we have a matrix with determinant is not zero, then we know how to find the inverse.

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:12.840
If a determinant is zero, then of course this method doesn't work.

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:17.260
But I'm saying, actually, even more, there isn't an inverse at all.

00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:18.800
It's not just that our method fails.

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:22.580
I cannot take the inverse of a matrix with determinant zero.

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:37.620
And geometrically, well, precisely the situation where the determinant is not zero is exactly this nice, usual situation where the three planes intersect in a point.

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:47.720
While the situation where the determinant is zero is this situation here where the line determined by the first two planes is parallel to the third plane.

00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:58.640
So let me emphasize this again.

00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:02.780
And let's see again what happens.

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:09.460
Okay, so let's start with an easier case.

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:21.300
So it's called the case of a homogeneous system.

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:30.940
It's called homogeneous because it's the situation where the equations are invariant and are scaling.

00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:35.300
So homogeneous system is one where the right hand side is zero.

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:40.380
There's no B. If you want the constant terms here are all zero.

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:41.620
Zero, zero, zero.

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.700
Okay, so this one is not homogeneous.

00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:47.980
So let's see what happens there.

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:57.600
Well, so what that means, you know, so let's take an example.

00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:09.880
So instead of this guy, we could take x plus z equals zero, x plus y equals zero, and x plus two y plus phase e also equals zero.

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:13.420
Well, can we solve these equations?

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:19.040
Yeah, I think actually you already know a very simple solution to these equations.

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:23.540
Yeah, you can just take x, y, and z all to be zero.

00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:43.280
So there's always an obvious solution, namely zero, zero, zero.

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:48.780
And in mathematical jump on this is called the trivial solution.

00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:51.660
Okay.

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:56.420
So there's always this trivial solution.

00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:58.900
And what's the geometric interpretation?

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:03.720
Well, having zeroes here means that all three planes pass for the origin.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:07.080
So certainly the origin is always a solution.

00:38:19.1000 --> 00:38:33.640
So the origin is always a solution because for three planes pass for the origin.

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:38.260
Okay.

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:42.660
So now there's two subcases.

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:48.880
One case is if the determinant of the matrix A is non-zero.

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:56.580
Well, that means that we can invert A.

00:38:56.580 --> 00:39:06.380
So if we can invert A, then that means we can solve the system by multiplying by A inverse.

00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:14.740
If we multiply by A inverse, well, we'll get x equals A inverse times zero, which is zero.

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:25.840
Okay. And that's the only solution because, well, you know, if A x is zero, then let's multiply by A inverse.

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:30.280
We get A inverse A x that x equals A inverse zero, that's zero.

00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:32.440
We get x equals zero. We've solved it.

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:35.020
Okay. No other solution.

00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:48.700
So to go back to this picture of that, we will enjoy its...

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:51.280
No, it's this case.

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:11.600
Okay. Now the other case, if the determinant of A equals zero, then it means that actually this doesn't quite work.

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:16.440
So let's see.

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:19.120
What does it mean that the determinant of A is zero?

00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:23.700
Well, remember, the entries in A, they are the coefficients in the equations.

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:30.040
Okay. But now the coefficients in the equations, they're exactly the normal vectors to the planes.

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:40.800
So that's the same thing as saying that the determinant of the three normal vectors to our three planes is zero.

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:59.720
So that means that N1, N2, and N3 are entry to the inner same plane.

00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:03.660
It's called co-planar. Okay. These three vectors are co-planar.

00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:09.040
So let's see what happens.

00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:14.200
So I claim it will correspond to this situation here.

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:17.160
Let's draw the normal vectors to these three planes.

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:25.180
Okay. Well, it's not very easy to see.

00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:31.440
Okay. So I've tried to draw the normal vectors to my planes.

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:37.840
Well, they're all in the direction that's perpendicular to the line of intersection.

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:39.400
They're all in the same plane.

00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:45.080
So if I try to form a box in an ordinary pipette with these three normal vectors,

00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:48.020
well, I will get something that's completely flat and has no volume.

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:51.080
Has volume zero. Okay.

00:41:51.980 --> 00:42:04.660
So the parallel pipette has volume zero.

00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:14.580
And the fact that the normal vectors are co-planar tells us that in fact,

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:19.280
let me start a new blackboard.

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:26.940
Okay. So now, let's say that our normal vectors N1, N2, and N3 are all in the same plane.

00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:33.820
And let's think about the direction that's perpendicular to N1, N2, and N3 at the same time.

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:37.320
Okay. I claim that will be the line of intersection.

00:42:59.080 --> 00:42:59.600
Okay.

00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:10.880
So let me try to draw that picture again.

00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:12.840
So we have three planes.

00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:23.520
Okay.

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:32.080
Now you see why I prepared the picture in advance. It's easier to draw it beforehand.

00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:37.760
And I said, the normal vectors are all in the same plane.

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:44.180
So, oh, what else do I know? I know that all these planes pass through the origin.

00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:50.200
Okay. So the origin is somewhere in the intersection of the three planes.

00:43:54.040 --> 00:44:01.440
Now, I said actually the normal vectors to my three planes.

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:06.560
Well, it's kind of hard to draw a bit.

00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:11.800
Our all actually co-planar.

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:17.920
Okay. So N1, N2, and N3 determine a plane.

00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:28.060
Well, now if I look at the line from the origin that's perpendicular to N1, N2, and N3,

00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:33.300
so perpendicular to this red plane here. That's a terrible picture.

00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:37.180
It's supposed to be in all the planes.

00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:42.980
Okay. You can see that better on the side planes.

00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:52.080
Okay. And why is that? Well, that's because my line, it's perpendicular to the normal vectors.

00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:55.660
So it's parallel to the planes. It's parallel to all the planes.

00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:59.240
Now, why is it in the plane instead of parallel to them?

00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:02.920
Well, that's because my line goes for the origin and the origin is on the plane.

00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:07.920
So certainly my line has to be contained in the planes, not parallel to them.

00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:23.040
Okay. So the line for the origin and perpendicular to the plane

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:36.640
of N1, N2, and N3 is parallel to all three planes.

00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:48.660
And because the planes go for the origin, it's contained in the plane.

00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:57.900
Okay. So what happens here is I have, in fact, infinitely many solutions.

00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:12.000
And how do I find these solutions? Well, if I want to find something that's perpendicular to N1, N3,

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:19.480
well, if I just want to be perpendicular to N1 and N2, I can take their cross product, exactly.

00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:36.260
So, for example, if I do N1 cross N2 is perpendicular to N1 and to N2,

00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:43.920
and also to N3, because N3 is in the same plane as N1 and N2.

00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:47.580
So if you're perpendicular to N1 and N2, you're also perpendicular to N3.

00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:56.780
It's automatic. So it's a non-trivial solution.

00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:05.560
This vector goes along the line of intersections.

00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:12.080
So that's the case of homogeneous systems.

00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:16.000
And then let's finish with the other case.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.040
So the general case.

00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:34.240
So that means if we look at a system A x equals B, well, with B now anything, there's two cases.

00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:51.180
If the determinant of A is not zero, then there's a unique solution, namely x equals A inverse B.

00:47:54.520 --> 00:48:05.460
If the determinant of A is zero, then it means actually we have a situation with planes that are all parallel to a same line.

00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:18.060
And then we have either no solution or infinitely many solutions.

00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:22.060
It cannot be a single solution.

00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:29.680
Now, whether you have no solutions or infinitely many solutions, well, we haven't actually developed the tools to answer that.

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:39.660
But if you try solving the system by hand, by elimination, you will see that you end up maybe with something that says zero equals zero, and you have infinitely many solutions.

00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:43.860
Actually, if you can find one solution, then you know that there's infinitely many.

00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:49.800
On the other hand, if you end up with something that's a contradiction, like 1 equals 2, then you know there's no solutions.

00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:54.920
Okay, so that's the end for today.

00:48:56.080 --> 00:49:00.160
And tomorrow, we will learn about parametric equations for lines and curves.
