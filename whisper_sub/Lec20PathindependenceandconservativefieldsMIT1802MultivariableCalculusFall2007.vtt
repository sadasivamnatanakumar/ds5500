00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.520
So let me remind you yesterday with defined and started

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:36.300
to compute line integrals for work of a vector field along a curve.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:44.960
So we have a curve in the plane C. We have a vector field F

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.320
that gives us a vector at every point.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.660
And we want to find a work done along the curve.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.920
So that's the line integral along C of F.dr.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.220
Or more geometrically, line integral along C of F.tds,

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.040
where t is the unit tangent vector, and ds is the arc length element.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:30.160
Or in coordinates, that's the integral of mdx plus ndy,

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.620
where m and n are the components of a vector field.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.240
Let's do an example that will just summarize what we did yesterday.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.960
And then we'll move on to interesting observations about physics.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.440
So here's an example we're going to look at now.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:09.180
Let's say I give you a vector field yi plus xj.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.340
So it's not completely obvious what it looks like.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.100
But here's a computer plot of that vector field.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.320
So that tells you a bit what it does,

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.480
points in all sorts of directions.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:31.660
And let's say we want to find the work done by this vector field.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.880
If I move along this closed curve, I

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:36.700
started the origin.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.820
Then I moved along the x axis to 1.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.620
Then I moved along the unit circle to the diagonal,

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.120
and then I moved back to the origin in a straight line.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:58.280
So C consists of three parts so that you

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:08.300
enclose a sector of a unit disk corresponding

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.440
to angles between 0 and 45 degrees.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.960
So to compute this line integral, what we have to do

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.920
is we have to set up three different integrals and add them together.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:42.640
So we need to set up the integral of ydx plus xdy for each

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.680
of these pieces, each of these pieces.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:53.020
So let's do the first one on the x axis.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.580
Well, one way to parameterize that is to just use the x variable.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:12.460
And say that because we're on the origin to 1,0,

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.400
well, we know we're on the x axis, so

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.880
there's y there is actually just 0.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.860
And the variable will be x from 0 to 1.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.340
If you prefer, you can parameterize things, say x equals t for t from 0 to 1,

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.400
and y equals 0.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.660
What doesn't change is y is 0, and therefore, dy is also 0.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:55.980
So in fact, we're integrating ydx plus xdy, but that becomes, well, 0dx plus 0.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.380
And that's just going to give you 0.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.700
So there's the line integral here is very easy to compute.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.220
Of course, you can also do it geometrically,

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.220
because geometrically, you can see in the picture, along the x axis,

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.100
the vector field is pointing vertically.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.760
If I'm on the x axis, my vector field is actually in the y direction.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.820
So it's perpendicular to my curve, so the work done is going to be 0.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.380
f dot t will be 0.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.560
So f dot t is 0, so v integral is 0.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.180
Any questions about this first part of a calculation?

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.060
No?

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.820
It's OK?

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:05.120
OK, let's move on to a more interesting part of it.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:12.360
Let's do the second part, which is a portion of a unit circle.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.920
So we should have drawn my picture.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:30.980
And so now we are moving on this part of the curve.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.760
Let's see, too.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.040
And of course, we have to choose how to express x and y

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.260
in terms of a single variable.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.640
Well, most likely, when you're moving on a circle,

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.960
you're going to use the angle along the circle to tell you where you are.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.940
So we're going to use the angle theta as parameter.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.740
And we'll say, well, we're on the unit circle, so x is cosine theta.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.060
And y is sine theta.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.520
What's the range of theta?

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:08.100
Feta goes from 0 to pi over 4.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:18.400
So whenever I see dx, I will replace it by, well, the derivative of cosine is negative

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:18.800
sine.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.180
So minus sine theta, the theta.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.860
And dy, the derivative of sine is cosine.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.640
So it will become cosine theta, the theta.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:34.780
So I'm computing the integral of y dx plus x dy.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:47.340
That means I'll be actually computing the integral

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:59.540
of y is sine theta dx that's negative sine theta d theta plus x cosine.

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:06.680
dy is cosine theta d theta from 0 to pi over 4.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:15.340
So that's integral from 0 to pi over 4 of cosine square minus sine square.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:25.120
And if you know your trig, then you should recognize this as cosine of 2 theta.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:34.920
So that will integrate to 1 half of sine 2 theta from 0 to pi over 4.

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:40.300
And sine pi over 2 is 1, so you will get 1 half.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.360
Any questions about this one?

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:49.700
No.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.240
OK, then let's do the third one.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:13.280
So the third guy is when we come back to the origin along the diagonal.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.580
OK, so we're going to straight line from this point.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:19.680
Where's this point?

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:24.240
Well, this point is 1 over root 2, 1 over root 2.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.060
And we go back to the origin.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:35.980
OK, so we need to figure out a way to express x and y in terms of the same parameter.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:43.440
So one way, which is very natural, would be to just say, well,

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.180
let's say we move from here to here over time.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.460
And you know, at time 0, we're here, at time 1, we're here.

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:52.400
We know how to parameterize this line.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:10:00.580
So what we could do is say, let's parameterize this line.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:12.600
So we start at 1 over root 2, and we go down by 1 over root 2 in time 1, and same with y.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:23.680
That's actually perfectly fine, but that's unnecessarily complicated.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.920
OK, why is it complicated?

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.140
Because we'll get all of these expressions.

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:35.540
It would be easier to actually just look at motion in this direction, and then say,

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:41.820
well, if we have a certain work, if we move from here to here, then the work done moving from here to here,

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:43.360
is just going to be the opposite.

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:53.980
OK, so in fact, we can do slightly better by just saying, well,

00:10:53.980 --> 00:11:07.540
we'll take x equals t, y equals t, t from 0 to 1 over root 2, and take, well, sorry.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:18.620
That gives us what I will call minus c free, which means c free backwards.

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:30.780
And then we can say the integral for work along minus c free is the opposite of the work along c free.

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:42.600
Or, you know, if you're comfortable with integration, where variables go down, then you could also say that t just goes from 1 over square root of 2 down to 0.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:47.640
And, you know, when you set up your integral, it will go from 1 over root 2 to 0.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:52.860
And of course, it will be the negative of the 1 from 0 to 1 over root 2. So it's the same thing.

00:11:56.100 --> 00:12:06.600
OK, so if we do it with this parameterization, we'll get that, well, of course, dx is dt, dy is dt.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:22.880
So the integral along minus c free of y dx plus x dy is just the integral from 0 to 1 over root 2 of t dt plus t dt.

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:27.220
Sorry, I'm messing up my blackboard.

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:44.260
OK, which is going to be, well, the integral of 2t dt, which is t squared between these bounds, which is 1 half.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.860
That's the integral along minus c free, along the reverse path.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:13:03.560
And if I want to do it along c free instead, then I just take the negative.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:13.040
OK, or if you prefer, you could have done it directly with integral from 1 over root 2 to 0, which gave you immediately the negative 1 half.

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:28.220
OK, so at the end, we get that the total work was the sum of the free line integrals.

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.600
I'm not writing f dot dr just to save space.

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:38.340
That's 0 plus 1 half minus 1 half. And that comes out to 0.

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:41.280
So a lot of calculations for nothing.

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:50.760
OK, so that should give you a good overview of various ways to compute line integrals.

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:52.440
Any questions about all that?

00:13:56.300 --> 00:14:04.460
No? OK, so next, let me tell you about how to avoid computing line integrals.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.920
Well, one is easy. Don't take this class, but that's not.

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:15.820
So here's another way not to do it.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:25.840
OK, so let's look a little bit about one kind of vector field that actually we've encountered a few weeks ago without saying it.

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:30.480
So we said when we have a function of two variables, we have a gradient vector.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:34.960
Well, at the time, it was just a vector, but that vector depended on x and y.

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:40.980
So in fact, it's a vector field. OK, so here's an interesting special case.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:51.020
Say that f, our vector field, is actually the gradient of some function.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.860
So it's a gradient field.

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:02.120
And so f is a function of two variables, x and y.

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:10.520
And that's called the potential for the vector field.

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:12.800
The reason is, of course, from physics.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:18.320
You know, in physics, you call potential, well, electrical potential or gravitational potential.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:30.740
The potential energy, this function of position that tells you how much actually energy is stored somehow by the force field.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.740
And its gradient gives you the force.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.940
Actually, not quite.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:39.140
If you're a physicist, then the force will be negative the gradient.

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:44.480
So that means that physicists' potentials are the opposite of the mathematician's potential.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.940
OK, so that's just here to confuse you.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:53.020
It doesn't really matter, but to make things simpler, we are using this convention.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.580
And you know, you just put a minus sign if you're doing physics.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:14.460
So then I claim we can simplify the evaluation of the line integral for all the physics.

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:29.520
So perhaps you've seen in physics, the work done by, say, the electrical force is actually given by the change in value of the potential from the starting point to the ending point.

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:32.820
Or same for gravitational force.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:40.140
So these are special cases of what's called the fundamental theorem of calculus for line integrals.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:48.000
So the fundamental theorem of calculus, not for line integrals, tells you if you integrate a derivative, then you get back the function.

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.680
And here it's the same thing in multivariable calculus.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:58.080
It tells you if you take the line integral of the gradient of a function, what you get back is the function.

00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:24.500
OK, so.

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:27.020
So.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:36.660
The fundamental theorem of calculus for line integrals.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:47.860
Says.

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:56.120
Following thing it says, if you integrate a vector field that's the gradient of a function.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.000
Along a curve.

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:07.740
Let's say that you have a curve that goes from some starting point p0 to some ending point p1.

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:15.960
Then all you will get is the value of f at p1 minus the value of f at p0.

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:27.620
OK, so that's a pretty nifty formula, but it only works if the field that you're integrating is a gradient.

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:30.900
You know it's a gradient and you know the function little f.

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:35.920
I mean, we can't put just any vector field in here.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:37.800
We have to put the gradient of f.

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:46.620
So actually on Tuesday we'll see how to decide whether a vector field is a gradient or not.

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:50.840
And if it is a gradient, how to find the potential function.

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:52.960
So we'll cover that.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.160
But for now, we're going to try to figure out a bit more about this.

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:05.000
What it says, what it means physically, how to think about it geometrically, and so on.

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:21.240
So maybe I should say, you know, if you try to find this in coordinates, because that's also a useful way to think about it.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:28.660
If I give you the line integral along c, so the gradient field, the components are f sub x and f sub y.

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:34.900
So it means I'm actually integrating f sub x dx plus f sub y dy.

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:41.660
Or if you prefer, that's the same thing as actually integrating df.

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:45.320
So I'm integrating the differential of a function f.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:51.540
Well, then that's the change in f.

00:19:54.240 --> 00:20:01.300
And of course, if you write it in this form, then probably it's quite obvious to you that this should be true.

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:10.400
I mean, in this form, actually, it's the same statement as in single variable calculus.

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:16.680
And actually, that's how we prove a theorem.

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:21.520
So let's prove this theorem.

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:26.520
How do we prove it?

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:31.640
Well, let's say I give you a curve, and I ask you to compute this integral.

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:33.300
How will you do that?

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:40.980
Well, the way you compute the integral actually is by choosing a parameter and expressing everything in terms of that parameter.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:52.720
So we'll set, well, so we know it's f sub x dx plus f sub y dy.

00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:05.500
And we'll want to parameterize c in the form x equals x of t, y equals y of t.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:14.420
So if we do that, then dx becomes x prime of t dt, dy becomes y prime of t dt.

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:29.500
So we know x is x of t, that tells us dx is x prime of t dt.

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:36.680
y is y of t gives us dy is y prime of t dt.

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:57.940
So now what we are integrating, actually, is becomes the integral of f sub x times dx dt plus f sub y times dy dt.

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:12.380
But now here I recognize a familiar guy, I've seen this one before, in the chain rule.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:23.080
This guy by the chain rule is the rate of change of f if I take x and y to be functions of t and I plug those into f.

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:36.560
So in fact, what I'm integrating is df dt when I think of f as a function of t by just plugging x and y as functions of t.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:39.640
dt.

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:53.020
And so maybe actually I should now say, you know, I have sometimes t goes from some initial time, let's say, t0 to t1.

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:08.320
And now by the usual fundamental theorem of calculus, I know that this will be just the change in the value of f between t0 and t1.

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:51.500
So integral from t0 to t1 of df dt, well that becomes f between t0 and t1.

00:23:52.340 --> 00:24:02.980
So f of what? We just have to be a little bit careful here. Well, it's not quite f of t, it's f seen as a function of t by putting x of t and y of t into it.

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.240
So let me write that down carefully.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:11.580
What I'm integrating to is f of x of t and y of t.

00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:15.980
Right? Does that sound fair?

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:16.940
Yeah.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:18.200
Okay.

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:24.960
And so when I plug in t1, I get the point where I am at time t1, that's the end point of my curve.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:31.160
When I plug t0, I will get the starting point of my curve p0.

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:33.640
And that's the end of the proof.

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:38.760
Put some of that hard.

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:41.220
Okay.

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:46.240
So let's see an example.

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:55.860
Well, let's look at that example again.

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:58.920
Okay. So we have this curve.

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:05.040
We had this vector field. Could it be that by accident that vector field was a gradient field?

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:10.960
So remember our vector field was y, x.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:17.820
Can we think of a function with derivative respect to x is y and derivative respect to y is x?

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:22.980
Yeah, x times y sounds like a good candidate.

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:27.200
Well, f of xy is xy.

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:29.080
Okay.

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:40.600
So that means that the line integrals that we computed along these things can be just evaluated from just finding out the values of f at the end point.

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:44.380
So here's version two of my plot.

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:52.380
Where I've added the contour plot of a function xy on top of the vector field.

00:25:53.380 --> 00:26:00.140
Actually see how you know the vector field is still pointing perpendicular to the level curves if we have c just to remind you.

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:08.600
And so now when we move, well, the origin is on the level curve f equal zero.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:13.040
And when we start going along c1, we stay on f equal zero.

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:15.860
So there's no work. The potential doesn't change.

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:22.020
Then on c2, the potential increases from zero to one half. The work is one half.

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:26.380
And then on c3, we go back down from one half to zero.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.400
The work is negative one half.

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:31.740
See, that was much easier than computing.

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:52.060
So for example, the integral along c2 is actually just.

00:26:52.740 --> 00:27:00.880
So c2 goes from one zero to one over two, one over two.

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:06.460
So that's one half minus zero, and that's one half.

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:16.300
Because c2 was going here.

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:22.980
And at this point, f is zero, at that point, f is one half.

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:27.180
And similarly for the others.

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:32.160
And of course, when you sum, you get zero because the total change in f,

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.940
when you know you go from here to here to here to here,

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:36.940
eventually you're back at the same place.

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:38.900
So f hasn't changed.

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.240
Okay, so that's a neat trick.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:49.640
And it's important conceptually because a lot of forces are gradients of potentials.

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:52.460
I mean, namely gravitational force, electric force.

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:57.260
The problem is not every vector field is a gradient.

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.160
A lot of vector fields are not gradients.

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:04.100
For example, magnetic fields, certainly are not gradients.

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:16.640
So a big warning.

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:36.360
Everything today only applies if f is a gradient field.

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.960
Okay, it's not true of n-wise.

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:11.960
Okay, let's see what are the consequences of a fundamental theorem.

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:28.480
So just to put one more time, this disclaimer,

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:40.680
if f is a gradient field, then what do we have?

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:46.560
Well, there's various nice features of work done by gradient fields

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.220
that are not true for over vector fields.

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:51.520
So one of them is this property of path independence.

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:03.160
Okay, so the claim is if I have a line integral to compute,

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:08.660
then it doesn't matter which path I take as long as it goes from point A to point B.

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:13.100
It just depends on the point where I start the point where I end.

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:17.720
And that certainly falls in general.

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:20.840
But for a gradient field, it works.

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:25.820
Okay, so if I have a point P0, a point P1,

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:32.500
and I have two different paths that go there, say C1 and C2,

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:37.480
so they go from the same point to the same point, but in different ways,

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:50.800
then in this situation, the line integral along C1 is equal to the line integral along C2.

00:30:55.440 --> 00:31:02.560
Well, actually, let me insist that this is only for gradient fields by putting gradient f in here.

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:08.640
Just so you know, you don't get tempted to ever use this for a field that's not a gradient field.

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:22.380
If C1 and C2 have the same start and end points.

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:29.600
Okay, how do we prove that?

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:30.500
Well, it's very easy.

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:32.060
We just use the fundamental theorem.

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:35.960
It tells us if you compute the line integral along C1,

00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:39.260
it's just f at this point minus f at this point.

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:41.260
If you do it for C2, well, same.

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:43.200
So they're the same.

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:48.400
And for that, you don't actually even need to know what little f is.

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:51.280
You know in advance that it's going to be the same.

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:55.640
So if I give you a vector field, and I tell you it's the gradient of a mysterious function,

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:59.020
but I don't tell you what the function is and you don't want to find out,

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:00.720
you can still use path independence.

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.100
But only if you know that it's a gradient.

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:25.740
Okay.

00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:31.480
Okay, I guess this one is dead.

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:37.280
But we'll stay here forever because nobody's stolen enough to erase it now.

00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:42.680
When you come back next year and you still see that formula, you'll see.

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:45.120
Okay.

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.800
Yes, but there's no useful information here.

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.700
That's a good point.

00:32:59.020 --> 00:32:59.140
Okay.

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:03.580
So what's another consequence?

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:13.760
One, I mean, so if you have a gradient field, it's what's called conservative.

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:18.120
Okay. So what's a conservative field?

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:23.540
Well, the word conservative comes from the idea in physics.

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:25.480
It's the notion of conservation of energy.

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:31.140
It tells you that you cannot get energy for free out of your first field.

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:38.720
So what it means is in particular, you know, if you take a closed trajectory,

00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:42.960
so a trajectory that goes from some point back to the same point.

00:33:44.740 --> 00:34:00.800
So if C is a closed curve, then the work done along C is zero.

00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:05.900
Okay. That's the definition of what it means to be conservative.

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:10.680
If I take any closed curve, the work will always be zero.

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:14.940
Contrary, you know, the contrary, not conservative means,

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:18.440
somewhere there is a curve along which the work is not zero.

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:24.000
If you find a curve where the work is zero, that's not enough to say it's conservative.

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:28.480
You have to show that no matter what curve I give you, if it's a closed curve,

00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:29.400
it will always be zero.

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:37.320
So what that means concretely is, you know, if you have a first field that's conservative,

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:41.680
then you cannot build somehow some, you know, perpetual motion out of it.

00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:45.380
You can't build something that will just keep going just powered by that force,

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:50.180
because that force is actually not providing any energy after you've gone, you know, one loop around.

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:54.220
Nothing's happened from the point of view of the energy provided by that force.

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:56.420
There's no work coming from the force.

00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:02.820
While if you have a first field that's not conservative, then you can try to actually maybe find a loop

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:06.220
where the work will be positive, and then, you know, that thing will just keep running.

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:14.780
So actually, if you look at magnetic fields and transformers or, you know, power adapters and things like that,

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:17.660
you precisely, you extract energy from a magnetic field.

00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:21.260
Of course, I mean, you actually have to take some power supply to maintain the magnetic field.

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:27.240
So a magnetic field, you could actually try to get energy from it almost for free.

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:30.380
A gravitational field or an electric field, you can't.

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:36.260
Okay. So.

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:40.600
And now, why does that hold?

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:46.460
Well, if I have a gradient field, then if I try to compute this line integral,

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:51.880
I know that it will be the value of a function at the end point, minus the value at the starting point.

00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:53.540
But they're the same.

00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:56.360
So, you know, the value is the same.

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:10.440
So if I have a gradient field, and I do the line integral, then I will get f at the end point,

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:12.660
minus f at the starting point.

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:16.180
But they have the same point, so that's.

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:27.180
Okay.

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:34.060
So just to reinforce my warning that not every field is a gradient field.

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:46.320
Let's look again at, you know, our favorite vector field from yesterday.

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:50.520
So our favorite vector field yesterday was negative y and x.

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:56.140
It's a vector field that just rotates around the origin counterclockwise.

00:36:56.140 --> 00:37:07.020
Okay. Well, we said if you take, say, say you take just the unit circle.

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:16.380
For example, counterclockwise.

00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:23.300
Well, remember we said yesterday that the line integral of f dot d r,

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:26.120
maybe I should say f dot t d s now.

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:30.760
So because the vector field is tangent to the circle.

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:42.300
So on the unit circle, f is tangent to the curve.

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:50.360
And so f dot t is length f times, well, length t, but t is a unit vector.

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:56.100
So it's length f and the length of f on the unit circle was just one.

00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:00.160
So that's the integral of one d s.

00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:02.920
So that's just the length of the circle. That's two pi.

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:05.960
And two pi is definitely not zero.

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:09.640
So this vector field is not conservative.

00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:16.380
And so now we know actually it's not the gradient of anything.

00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:22.620
Because if it were gradient, then it would be conservative and it's not.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.140
So that's you.

00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:30.800
It's an example of a vector field that is not conservative.

00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:33.760
It's not path independent either by the way.

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:42.420
Because see, if I go from here to here along the upper half circle or under the lower, along the lower half circle.

00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:45.980
In one case, I will get pi. In the other case, I will get negative pi.

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:50.380
I don't get the same answer. And so on and so on.

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:53.080
It just fails to have all of these properties.

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:57.960
So maybe I will write that down.

00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:00.820
It's not conservative.

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:07.800
Not path independent.

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:14.600
It's not a gradient.

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:22.180
It doesn't have any of these properties.

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:30.400
Any questions?

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:34.440
Yes.

00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:40.220
How do you determine whether something is a gradient of not?

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:42.200
Well, that's what we will see on Tuesday.

00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:52.340
Is it possible that it's conservative and not path independent or vice versa?

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:53.160
The answer is no.

00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:54.660
These two properties are equivalent.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.240
We are going to see that right now.

00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:58.780
At least that's the plan.

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:08.560
So if it's not conservative, then it's possible to draw a level curve.

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:12.800
Let's see.

00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:16.980
If it's not path independent, then we cannot draw level curves.

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:23.440
I wouldn't necessarily go that far.

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:26.600
You might be able to draw curves that are perpendicular to it.

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:30.680
But they won't be the level curves of a function for which this is the gradient.

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:39.220
I mean, you might still have, you know, if you take this gradient field and scale it,

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:41.660
but in strange ways, you know, multiplied by two in some places,

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:44.440
by one in other places, by five in some other places,

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:47.200
you will get something that won't be conservative anymore.

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:49.520
And it will still be perpendicular to the curves.

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:52.940
So it's more subtle than that.

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:56.960
But certainly if it's not conservative, then it's not a gradient,

00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:59.600
and you cannot do what we say.

00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:05.280
And how to decide whether it is or not that will be Tuesday's topic.

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:12.580
So for now, I just want to figure out again.

00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:15.720
Actually, let's now state all these properties.

00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:39.440
Actually, let me first do one minute of physics.

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:46.720
So let me just tell you again, you know, what's the physics in here.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:57.280
So if the first field is the gradient of a potential.

00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:06.840
So I'll still keep my plus sign.

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:08.360
So maybe I should say this is minus physics.

00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:24.720
So the work of f is the change in value of potential from one endpoint to the other endpoint.

00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:43.860
And so you might know about gravity, oops, gravity,

00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:51.460
rational field or electrical,

00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:07.180
or electrical potential.

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:19.120
And in case you haven't done any 802 yet, electrical potential is also commonly known as voltage.

00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:22.660
It's the one that makes it hurt when you stick your fingers into the socket.

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:28.620
Don't try.

00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:28.620


00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:49.420
And so now conservativeness means no energy can be extracted for free

00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:55.340
from the field.

00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:12.260
You can't just have a particle moving in that field and going on indefinitely faster and faster or actually friction then keep moving.

00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:22.180
So total energy is conserved.

00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:28.580
And I guess that's why we call that conservative.

00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:46.780
Okay, so let's end with a recap of various equivalent properties.

00:44:48.980 --> 00:45:02.040
Okay, so the first property that I will have for a vector field is that it's conservative.

00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:17.580
So to save at a vector field is conservative means that the line integral is zero along any closed curve.

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:45.120
So now I claim this is the same thing as a second property which is that the line integral of f is path independent.

00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:57.520
Okay, so that means if I have two paths with the same end points then I will get always the same answer.

00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:03.220
Why is that equivalent? Well, let's say that I'm path independent.

00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:12.480
If I'm path independent then if I take a closed curve well it has the same end points as just the curve that doesn't move at all.

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:19.760
So path independent tells me instead of going all around I could just stay where I am and then the work would be just zero.

00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:30.300
So if I'm path independent then I'm conservative. Conversely let's say that I'm just conservative and I want to check path independence.

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:36.560
Well, so I have two points and I have two paths between them.

00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:40.760
I want to show that the work is the same. Well, how do I do that?

00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:50.280
Let's see one and see two. Well, I observe that if I do C1 minus C2 I get a closed path.

00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:57.220
Right? If I go first from here to here and then back along that one I get a closed path.

00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:06.580
So if I'm conservative I should get zero. But if I get zero on C1 minus C2 it means that the work on C1 and the work on C2 are the same.

00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:14.840
See, so it's the same. It's just a different way to think about the situation.

00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:24.420
More things that are equivalent. You have two more things to say.

00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:29.260
The third one is equivalent to F being a gradient field.

00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:47.980
So this is equivalent to the third property F is a gradient field.

00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:04.620
Why? Well, if we know that it's a gradient field then we've seen that we get these properties out of a fundamental theorem.

00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:13.520
The question is if I have a conservative or path independent vector field, why is it the gradient of something?

00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:21.080
So this way is a fundamental theorem.

00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:36.180
That way, well, so that actually, let me just say that will be how we find the potential.

00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:47.560
So how do we find the potential? Well, let's say that I know the value of my potential here.

00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:53.520
Actually I get to choose what it is. Remember, in physics the potential is defined up to adding or subtracting a constant.

00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:55.860
What matters is only the change in potential.

00:48:56.980 --> 00:49:00.220
So let's say I know my potential here and I want to know my potential here.

00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:10.940
What do I do? Well, I take my favorite particle and I move it from here to here and I look at the work done and that tells me how much the potential has changed.

00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:14.020
So that tells me what the potential should be here.

00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:21.100
And this does not depend on my chose of path because I've assumed that I'm path independent.

00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:25.060
So that's what we will do on Tuesday.

00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:30.460
And let me just state a fourth property. That's the same.

00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:36.120
So all that stuff is the same as also four.

00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:45.720
If I look at mdx plus ndy is what's called an exact differential.

00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:55.460
So what that means, an exact differential means it can be put in the form df for some function f.

00:49:56.220 --> 00:50:08.060
And you know, I'm just reformulating this thing because I'm saying just I can put it in the form f sub xdx plus f sub ydy, which means my vector field was a gradient field.

00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:09.680
So these things are really the same.

00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:20.760
Okay. So after the weekend on Tuesday, we'll actually figure out how to decide whether these things hold or not and how to find the potential.
