00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.380
Let me start by basically listing the main things

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.200
we've learned over the past three weeks or so.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.680
And I'll add a few compliments of information about that,

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.280
because there's a few small details

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.280
that I didn't quite clarify and that I should probably

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.720
make a bit clearer, especially what

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.040
happened at the very end of yesterday's class.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.380
So here's a list of things that should be on your review

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.360
sheet for the exam.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.780
So the first thing we learned about the main topic of this unit

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.840
is about functions of several variables.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.720
So we've learned how to think of functions of two

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.960
of revivals in terms of plotting them, in particular,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.140
well, not only the graph, but also the contour plot

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.000
and how to read a contour plot.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.160
And we've learned how to study variations of these functions

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.940
using partial derivatives.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.460
So remember, we've defined the partial of f with respect

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.580
to some variables say x to be the rate of change with respect

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.400
to x when we hold all the other variables constant.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.600
So if you have a function of x and y,

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.080
this symbol means you differentiate with respect

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.280
to x, trading y as a constant.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.740
And we've learned how to package partial derivatives

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.140
into a vector, the gradient vector.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.280
So for example, if we have a function of variables,

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.500
that's just the vector with components

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.600
of the partial derivatives.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.180
And we've seen how to use the gradient vector

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.340
of the partial derivatives to derive various things,

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.320
such as approximation formulas.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.420
So the change in f when we change x, y, and z slightly

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.860
is approximately equal to, well, there's several terms.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.040
And I can rewrite this in vector form as the gradient dot

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.480
product, the amount by which the position vector has changed.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.980
So basically, what causes f to change

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.820
is that I'm changing x, y, and z by small amounts.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.040
And how sensitive f is to each variable

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.940
is precisely what the partial derivatives measure.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.480
And in particular, we can use, so this approximation

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.160
is called the tangent plane approximation,

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.600
because it tells us, in fact, it amounts

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.940
to identifying the graph of a function with its tangent plane.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.580
It means that we assume that the function

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.380
depends more or less linearly on x, y, z.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.580
And if we set these things equal, what we get is actually,

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.680
we are replacing the function by its linear approximation.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.400
We are replacing the graph by its tangent plane.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.820
Except, of course, we haven't seen the graph of a function

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.120
of three variables, because that would

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.660
live in four dimensional space.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.920
So when we think of the graph, that's really

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.300
with a function of two variables.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.620
That also tells us how to find tangent planes

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:12.240
to level surfaces.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:33.140
So recall that the tangent plane to a surface given by the equation

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.840
f of x, y, z equals c at a given point can be found

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.340
by looking first for its normal vector.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.200
And we know that the normal vector is actually,

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.460
well, one normal vector is given by the gradient of a function,

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.560
because we know that the gradient is actually pointing

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.280
perpendicularly to the level sets towards higher values

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.740
of a function.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.640
It gives us the direction of fastest increase of a function.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.520
Any questions about these topics?

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:20.720
OK, so let me add actually a cultural note

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.800
to what we've seen so far about partial derivatives

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.220
and how to use them, which is maybe something

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.920
I should have mentioned a couple of weeks ago.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.400
So why do we like partial derivatives?

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.100
Well, one obvious reason is we can do all these things.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.640
But another reason is that really you need partial derivatives

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.960
to do physics and to do, actually,

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.840
to understand much of the world that's around you,

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.560
because a lot of things actually

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.100
are governed by what's called partial differential equations.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.680
So that's, if you want a cultural remark about what

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.680
this is good for.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.880
So a partial differential equation

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.820
is an equation that involves the partial derivatives

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.000
of a function.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.340
So you have some function that's unknown

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.460
that depends on a bunch of variables.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.860
And a partial differential equation

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.680
is some relation between its partial derivatives.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.540
So let me see.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.380
These are equations involving.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:47.660
The partial derivatives of an unknown function.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.780
So let me give you an example to see how that works.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.940
So for example, the heat equation

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.300
is one example of a partial differential equation.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.680
It's the equation, well, let me write for you

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.340
the space version of it.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.340
And the equation partial f partial t

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:21.840
equals some constant times the sum of the second

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.840
partial with respect to x, y, and z.

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.580
So this is an equation where we're

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:35.220
trying to solve for a function f that

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:40.640
depends, actually, on four variables, x, y, z, and t.

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:46.280
And what should you have in mind?

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.100
Well, this equation governs temperature.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:52.900
So if you think that f of x, y, z t

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.880
will be the temperature at a point in space,

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.500
at position x, y, z, and at time t,

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.740
then this tells you how temperature changes over time.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.320
It tells you that at any given point,

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.980
the rate of change of temperature over time

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.960
is given by this complicated expression

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.620
in the partial derivatives in terms

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.860
of the space coordinates x, y, z.

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:21.160
So if you know, for example, the initial distribution

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.560
of temperature in this room, and if you assume

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.320
that nothing is generating heat or taking heat away,

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.620
so if you don't have any air conditioning or heating going on,

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.800
then it will tell you how the temperature will change over time

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:34.900
and eventually stabilize to some final value.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:36.220
Yes?

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.640
Why do we take the partial derivative twice?

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.460
Well, that's a question, I'd say.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.740
It's a question for a physics person,

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.220
but actually I'm going to, no.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.840
In a few weeks, we'll actually see a derivation

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.820
of where this equation comes from and try to justify it.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.320
But really, that's something you will see in a physics class.

00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:00.200
The reason for that is basically physics

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:05.580
of how heat is transported between particles in a fluid

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.120
or actually in any medium.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:11.460
But this constant k actually is called the heat conductivity.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:14.540
It tells you how well the heat flows through the material

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:15.320
that you're looking at.

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:21.540
So anyway, I'm giving it to you just to show you an example

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.260
of a real life problem, where in fact,

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:25.780
you have to solve one of these things.

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.600
So now how to solve partial differential equations

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.200
is not a topic for this class.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:32.560
It's not even a topic for 18 or three,

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.340
which is called differential equations, without partial,

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.720
which means that actually you will learn tools

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.000
to study and solve these equations,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.760
but when there's only one variable involved.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.920
And you'll see it's already quite hard.

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.500
And if you want more, then later on,

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.400
we have many fine classes about partial differential equations.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:53.760
But one thing at a time.

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:58.120
So just I wanted to point out to you that very often,

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.120
functions that you see in real life

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.820
satisfy many nice relations between their partial derivatives.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.660
So that was, in case you were wondering why

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.540
on the syllabus for today, it said partial differential equations

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.140
now we've officially covered the topic.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.720
That's basically all we need to know about it.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:17.260


00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.420
But we'll get back to that a bit later.

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:22.180
You'll see.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:25.280
OK.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.500
If there's no further questions,

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.760
let me continue and go back to my list of topics.

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:33.800
Oh, sorry, I should have written down.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:35.140
OK.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:40.260
But this equation is solved by temperature

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.920
at the point x, y, z at time t.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:48.740
OK.

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:54.860
And there are actually many other interesting partial differential equations.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.440
You will maybe sometime learn about the wave equation

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.640
that governs how waves propagate in space

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:02.500
about the diffusion equation,

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.840
which tells you how, you know, when you have maybe a mixture

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:10.280
of two fluids, how this somehow makes over time and so on.

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:13.360
There's basically two every problem you might want to consider.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.120
There's a partial differential equation to solve.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:19.260
OK.

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:21.080
Anyway, sorry, back to my list of topics.

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:26.180
So one important application we've seen of partial derivatives

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:30.640
is to try to optimize things, try to solve minimum, maximum problems.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:46.740
So remember that we've introduced

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:48.760
an option of critical points of a function.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:56.920
So a critical point is when all the partial derivatives are zero.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.360
And then there are various kinds of critical points.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.840
There are maxima, there's minima, but there's also saddle points.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:14.440
And we've seen a method using second derivatives

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:23.040
to decide which kind of critical point we have.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:29.540
So I should say that's for a function of two variables.

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.720
To try to decide whether a given critical point

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.340
is a minimum, a maximum or a saddle point.

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:44.340
And we've also seen that actually that's not enough

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:46.340
to find the minimum of a maximum of a function

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:50.300
because the minimum of a maximum could occur on the boundary.

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.100
So just to give you a small reminder,

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.240
when you have a function of one variable, you know,

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:59.180
if you're trying to find the minimum and the maximum

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.920
of say a function with graph looks like this,

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.800
well, you're going to tell me quite obviously

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.900
that the maximum is this point up here.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.740
And that's a point where the first derivative is zero,

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:11.680
that's a critical point.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.640
And we use the second derivative to see

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.720
that this critical point is a local maximum.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:21.380
But then when we're looking for the minimum of a function,

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:23.360
well, it's not that a critical point,

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:28.020
it's actually here at the boundary of the domain of,

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:30.580
the range of values that we're going to consider.

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:36.580
So here the minimum is at the boundary.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:43.000
And the maximum is at a critical point.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:50.860
So similarly, when you have a function of several variables,

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.000
say of two variables, for example,

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:56.160
then the minimum and the maximum will be achieved

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.760
either at a critical point,

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.100
and then we can use these methods to find where they are,

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:05.200
or somewhere on the boundary of the set of values

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:05.940
that are allowed.

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:10.100
So it could be that we actually achieve the minimum

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.280
by making x and y as small as possible,

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:15.080
maybe letting them go to zero if they had to be positive,

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:17.380
or maybe by making them go to infinity.

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:22.060
So we have to keep our minds open and look

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:23.000
at various possibilities.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.100
So we're going to do a problem like that.

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:28.640
We're going to go over practice problem

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:31.920
from the practice test to clarify this.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.560
So another important cultural application

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:39.500
of minimum maximum problems in two variables

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:43.400
that we've seen in class is the list squares method

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:48.100
to find the best fit line or the best fit anything, really,

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:52.760
to find when you have a set of data points,

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:57.640
what's the best linear approximation

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:58.500
for this data point?

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.940
And here I have some good news for you

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.660
while you should definitely know what this is about,

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.740
it will not be on the test.

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:09.740
Let's go.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:16.620
Let's go.

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:17.920
Let's go.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.000
Let's go.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:29.940
Let's go.

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:29.940


00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:30.020


00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:30.020


00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:32.140
That doesn't mean that you should forget everything

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:33.480
we've seen about it, okay?

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:35.940
Okay.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:38.720
Okay.

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:38.720


00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:38.720


00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:47.000
Now, what's next on my list of topics?

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.520
So we've seen differentials.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:01.960
So remember the differential of f by definition

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:06.000
would be this kind of quantity.

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:10.000
So at first it looks just like a new way to package

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.120
partial derivatives together into some new kind of object.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.180
Now, what is this good for?

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.540
Well, it's a good way to remember approximation formulas.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:22.120
It's a good way to also study how variations in x, y, z

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.460
relate to variations in f.

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:29.000
In particular, we can divide this by variations of,

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:33.400
actually, by dx or by dy or by dz in any situation

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:37.340
that we want to find or by dy of some other variable

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:38.340
to get chain rules.

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:47.420
So the chain rule says, for example, well,

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:51.240
there's many different situations, but for example,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:58.380
if x, y, and z depend on some other variable say

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.920
variables may be even u and v,

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:08.980
then that means that f becomes a function of u and v.

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:12.580
And then we can ask ourselves how sensitive is f

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.740
to the value of u?

00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:19.420
And well, we can answer that.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.380
So the chain rule is something like this.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.340
And let me explain to you again where this comes from.

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:43.060
So basically, what this quantity means is if we change u

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:46.160
and keep v constant, what happens to the value of f?

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.380
Well, why would the value of f change in the first place

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:52.900
when f is just a function of x, y, z and not directly of u?

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:56.300
Well, it changes because x, y, and z depend on u.

00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:00.180
So first we have to figure out how quickly x, y, and z change

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:01.020
when we change u.

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:05.980
Well, how quickly we do that is precisely partial x, partial u,

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:08.360
partial y, partial u, partial z, partial u.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.560
These are the rates of change of x, y, z when we change u.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:16.620
And now when we change x, y, and z, that causes f to change.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:17.980
How much does f change?

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:22.180
Well, partial f, partial x tells us how quickly f changes

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:23.420
if I just change x.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:27.940
So I get this, that's the change in f,

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:31.920
caused just by the fact that x changes when you change it.

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.340
But then why also changes?

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:38.340
Why changes at this rate and that causes f to change at that rate?

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:42.680
And z changes as well and that causes f to change at that rate.

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.360
And the effects add up together.

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:46.060
Does that make sense?

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:47.460
Okay.

00:18:56.660 --> 00:19:01.020
And so in particular we can use the chain rule to do changes of variables.

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:05.960
If we have, say, a function defined in terms of polar coordinates are and theta.

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.400
And we'd like to switch it to rectangular coordinates x and y.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:13.000
Then we can use chain rules to relate the partial derivatives.

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:26.180
And finally, last but not least, we've seen how to deal with non-independent variables.

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:35.920
So when our variables say x, y, z are related by some equation.

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:43.820
So one way we can deal with this is to solve for one of the variables and go back to two independent variables.

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:45.800
But we can't always do that.

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:51.480
Of course, on the exam you can be sure that I will make sure that you cannot solve for the variable you want to remove.

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:53.060
Because that would be too easy.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:20:00.460
So then when we have to keep all of them but handle, you know, take into account this relation,

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:04.280
we've seen two useful methods.

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:13.560
One of them is to find the minimum of a maximum of a function when the variables are not independent.

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:16.980
And that's the method of Lagrange multipliers.

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:41.280
So remember to find the minimum or maximum of a function f subject to the constraint.

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:47.880
And g equals constant.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:57.820
Well, we've write down equations that say that the gradient of f is actually proportional to the gradient of g.

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:04.140
So there's a new variable here, lambda, the multiplier.

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:12.660
So, you know, for example, if f g, well, I guess here I had functions of three variables.

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:14.120
So this becomes three equations.

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:16.880
f sub x equals lambda g sub x.

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:20.320
f sub y equals lambda g sub y.

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:23.380
And f sub z equals lambda g sub z.

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:32.180
And when we plug in the formulas for f and g, well, we're left with three equations involving the four variables x, y, z, and lambda.

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:33.500
What's wrong?

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:37.060
Well, we don't have actually four independent variables.

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:47.020
We also have this relation g equals, well, whatever the constraint was relating x, y, and z together.

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.800
So then we can try to solve this.

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:55.460
And depending on situations, it's sometimes easy and sometimes it's very hard or even impossible.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:01.840
So in particular on the test, I haven't decided yet.

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:08.160
But it could well be that the problem about Lagrange multipliers will just ask you to write the equations not to solve them.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.160
Okay, so...

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:12.720
Well, I don't know yet.

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:15.420
Okay, I'm not promising anything.

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:22.120
But just, you know, before you start solving, check whether the problem asks you to solve them on it.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:25.960
Okay, if it doesn't, then probably you wouldn't.

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:58.760
Okay.

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:08.380
Okay. So another topic that we saw just yesterday is constraint partial derivatives.

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:20.460
And I guess I have to re-explain a little bit because my guess is that things were not extremely clear at the end of class yesterday.

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:24.940
So now we're in the same situation.

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:39.020
We have a function, let's say, f of x, y, z, where the variables x, y, and z are not independent, but are constrained by some relation of this form.

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:43.920
So some quantity involving x, y, and z is equal to maybe zero or some other constant.

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:58.540
And then what we want to know is what is the rate of change of f with respect to one of the variables, say x or y or z, when I keep the others constant?

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:07.680
Well, I can't keep all the others constant because that wouldn't be compatible with this condition.

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:15.480
I mean, that would be the usual, also called formal partial derivative of f, ignoring the constraint.

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:27.140
To take this into account means that if we vary one variable while keeping another one fixed, then the third one, since it depends on them, must also change somehow.

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:29.000
And we must take that into account.

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:42.900
So let's say, for example, we want to find some going to do a different example from yesterday, so that if you really didn't like that one, you don't have to see it again.

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:52.600
So let's say that we want to find the partial derivative of f with respect to z keeping y constant.

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:54.560
So what does that mean?

00:24:55.700 --> 00:25:10.640
That means y is constant, z varies, and x somehow is mysteriously a function of y and z through this equation.

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:15.320
And then, of course, because it depends on y, that means x will vary.

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:18.800
Sorry, x depends on y and z and z varies.

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:25.480
So now we're asking ourselves, what's the rate of change of f with respect to z in this situation?

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:43.940
And so we have two methods to do that.

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:53.500
So let me start with one with the frontials, which hopefully you kind of understood yesterday.

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.720
But if not, here's the second chance.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:10.480
So using the frontials means that we'll try to express df in terms of dz in this particular situation.

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:13.760
So what do we know about df in general?

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:23.780
Well, we know that df is f sub x dx plus f sub y dy plus partial f partial z dz.

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:26.640
That's the general statement.

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:28.620
But of course, we're in a special case.

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:31.480
We're in a special case where first y is constant.

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:37.620
Y is constant means that we can set dy to be zero.

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:47.900
So this goes away and becomes zero.

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:52.800
The second thing is, actually, we don't care about x.

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:57.400
We'd like to get rid of x because it's this dependent variable.

00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:00.980
What we really want to do is express df only in terms of dz.

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:13.120
So what we need is to relate dx with dz.

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:18.540
Well, to do that, we need to look at how the variables are related.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:21.100
So we need to look at the constraint, g.

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:23.460
Well, how do we do that?

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:25.520
We look at the differential of g.

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:33.900
So dg is g sub x dx plus g sub y dy plus g sub z dz.

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:38.900
And that's zero because we are setting g to always stay constant.

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:40.460
G doesn't change.

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:46.540
If g doesn't change, then we have a relation between dx dy and dz.

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:51.260
Well, in fact, we said we are going to look only at the case where y is constant.

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:52.940
So y doesn't change.

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:55.540
This becomes zero.

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:58.980
Well, now we have our relation between dx and dz.

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:01.180
We know how x depends on z.

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:08.460
And when we know how x depends on z, we can plug that into here and get how f depends on z.

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:10.780
Let's do that.

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:12.000
Oh.

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:14.860
Oh.

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:16.480
Oh.

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:16.480


00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:17.660


00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:21.300
Okay.

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:24.900
So.

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:36.720
Well, so again, saying that g cannot change and keeping y constant tells us gx dx plus gz dz is zero.

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:45.060
And we'd like to solve for dx in terms of dz that tells us dx should be.

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:50.800
Minus gz dz divided by gx.

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:52.880
Okay.

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:58.960
So if you want, this is the rate of change of x with respect to z when we keep y constant.

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:03.760
In our new terminology, this is partial z.

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:04.620
No.

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:10.200
This is partial x over partial z with y held constant.

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:18.240
Okay. This is the rate of change of x with respect to z.

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:24.080
So now when we know that we are going to plug that into this equation.

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:36.880
And that will tell us that df is f sub x times dx.

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:37.960
Well, what is dx?

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:44.760
dx is now minus gz over gx dz plus fz dz.

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:54.980
So that will be minus fx gz over gx plus fz times dz.

00:29:56.340 --> 00:30:04.240
And so this coefficient here is the rate of change of f with respect to z in the situation we are considering.

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:13.100
So this quantity is what we call partial f over partial z with y held constant.

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:15.760
That's what we wanted to find.

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:17.800
Okay.

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:24.460
So now let's see another way to do the same calculation.

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:27.700
And then you can choose which one you prefer.

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:51.140
Okay.

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:59.820
So the other method is using the chain rule.

00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:06.500
Okay.

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:15.460
So let's use the chain rule to understand how f depends on z when y is held constant.

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:21.080
So let me first fight the chain rule brutally and then we'll try to analyze what's going on.

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:28.960
So you can just use the version that I have affair as a template to see what's going on.

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:37.160
But I'm going to explain it markedly again.

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:48.140
Okay.

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:54.480
Okay. So that's the most mechanical and no.

00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:58.140
Mindless way of fighting down the chain rule.

00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:02.680
I'm just saying here, let's say that I'm varying z keeping y constant.

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:07.000
I want to know how f changes. Well, f might change because x might change.

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:09.980
Why might change? And z might change.

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:18.800
Now how quickly does x change? Well, the rate of change of x in the situation is partial x partial z with y held constant.

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:25.060
So if I change x at this rate, then f will change at that rate.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:34.660
Now, why might change? So the rate of change of y would be the rate of change of y respect to z holding y constant.

00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:38.520
Wait a second. If y is held constant, then y doesn't change.

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:42.240
So actually this guy is zero. And you didn't really have to write that term.

00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:45.440
But I wrote it just to be systematic. Okay.

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:53.280
If y had been somehow able to change at a certain rate, then that would have caused f to change at that rate.

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:57.560
Of course, if f is held constant, sorry, if y is held constant, then nothing happens here.

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:04.100
And finally, while z is changing at a certain rate, this rate is this one.

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:09.820
And that causes f to change at that rate. And then we add the effects together.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.520
Okay. See, it's nothing but the good old chain rule.

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:17.820
Just I've put these extra subscripts to tell us what is held constant and what isn't.

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:27.560
Okay. Now, of course, we can simplify it a bit more because here, how quickly does z change, if I'm changing z,

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:30.960
well, the rate of change of z with respect to itself is just one.

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:44.540
Okay. So in fact, the really mysterious part of this is the one here, which is the rate of change of x with respect to z.

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:47.420
And to find that, we have to understand the constraint.

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:53.620
Okay. So how can we find the rate of change of x with respect to z?

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:57.900
Well, we could use differentials, like we did here, but we can also keep using the chain rule.

00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:24.340
Okay. So how can I do that? Well, I can just look at how g would change with respect to z when y is held constant.

00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:27.940
So I just do the same calculation, but with g instead of f.

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:36.720
But before I do it, let's ask ourselves first what is this equal to.

00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:46.940
Well, if g is held constant, then when we vary z, keeping y constant and changing x, well, g still doesn't change.

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:55.420
It's held constant. So in fact, that should be zero.

00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:59.000
Okay. But if we just say that, we're not going to get to that.

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:03.880
So let's see how we can compute that using the chain rule.

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:09.220
Well, the chain rule tells us g changes because x, y, and z change.

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:15.840
Okay. How does it change because of x? Well, partial g partial x times the rate of change of x.

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:23.020
How does it change because of y? Well, partial g partial y times the rate of change of y.

00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:27.960
But of course, if you're smarter than me, then you don't need to actually write this one because y is held constant.

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:34.220
And then there's the rate of change because z changes.

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:41.140
And how quickly z changes here, of course, is one.

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:46.380
Okay. So out of this, you get that.

00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:56.940
Well, I'm tired of writing partial g partial x. Let me just write g sub x times partial x partial z.

00:35:56.940 --> 00:36:00.500
So let me write the y constant plus g sub z.

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:07.920
Okay. And now we found how x depends on z.

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:17.960
Partial x partial z with y held constant is negative g sub z over g sub x.

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:22.300
Now we plug this into that and we get our answer.

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:28.720
Okay. So it goes all the way up here.

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:35.380
Okay. And then we get the answer. I'm not going to, well, I guess I can write it again.

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:57.460
So there was partial f partial x times this guy minus g sub z over g sub x plus partial f over partial z.

00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:03.360
And you can observe that this is exactly the same formula that we had over here.

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:07.260
In fact, let's compare these two methods side by side.

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:11.560
I claimed we did exactly the same thing just with different notations.

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:19.780
See, if you take the differential of f and you divide it by dz in this situation where y is held constant and so on,

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:22.420
you get exactly this chain rule up there.

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:31.120
Right? That chain rule up there is this guy df divided by dz with y held constant.

00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:40.760
And the term involving dy was replaced by zero on both sides because we knew actually that y is held constant.

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:45.420
Now the real difficulty in both cases comes from dx.

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:48.640
And what we do about dx is we use the constraint.

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:52.080
So here we use it by writing dg equals zero.

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:58.480
Here we write the chain rule for g. That's the same thing just divided by dz with y held constant.

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:07.620
So this formula or that formula are the same just dividing by dz with y held constant.

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:12.020
And then in both cases we use that to solve for dx.

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:20.420
And then we plugged into the formula for df to express df dz or partial f partial z with y held constant.

00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:26.520
So the two methods are pretty much the same.

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:28.420
Quick pull, we'll preface this one.

00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:31.260
We'll preface that one.

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:36.520
Majority vote seems to be for differentials, that doesn't mean that it's better.

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:37.400
Both are fine.

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:40.500
You can use whichever one you want.

00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:42.840
But you could give both a try.

00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:47.720
Any questions?

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:54.320
Sorry, can we use?

00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:58.620
Yes, thank you.

00:38:58.760 --> 00:38:59.840
I forgot to mention it.

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:01.840
Where did that go?

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:03.700
I think I raised that part.

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:13.860
So yes, we need to know directional derivatives.

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:27.960
The pretty much the only thing to remember about them is that the fDS in the direction of some unit vector u is just the gradient f dot product with u.

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:33.260
So that's pretty much all we know about them.

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:37.060
Any other topics that I forgot to list?

00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:39.660
No?

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:41.640
Yes?

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:46.100
You have some free boards at the time?

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:47.660
No, I would need free hands to do that.

00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:52.700
Okay.

00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:57.420
Let's see.

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:02.000
Okay.

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:07.500
I think what we should do for is look quickly at the practice tests.

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:12.280
I mean given the time, you will mostly have to think about it yourselves.

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:16.960
So hopefully you have a copy of the practice exam.

00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:19.200
Oh, yes.

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:23.080
Okay, so let's look at the second.

00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:26.100
So the first problem is a simple problem.

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:28.180
Find the gradient, find an approximation formula.

00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:29.540
Hopefully you know how to do that.

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:32.560
The second problem is when about reading a control plot.

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:38.380
And so before I let you go for a weekend, I want to make sure that you actually know how to read a control plot.

00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:55.120
So one thing I should first mention is, you know, this problem asks you to estimate partial derivatives by reading a control plot.

00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:57.360
We haven't done that, so that won't be actually on the test.

00:40:57.540 --> 00:41:01.360
We'll be doing qualitative questions like what is the sign of a partial derivative?

00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:03.640
Is it zero, less than zero, more than zero?

00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:09.060
So you don't need to bring a ruler to estimate partial derivatives in the way that this problem asks you to.

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:27.060
Okay.

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:27.800
Okay.

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:36.680
Okay, so let's look at problem 2b.

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:43.360
Problem 2b is asking you to find a point at which h equals 2200.

00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:48.360
Partial h, partial x equals zero, and partial h, partial y is less than zero.

00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:52.080
So let's try and see what is going on here.

00:41:52.080 --> 00:42:00.320
So a point where f equals 2200, well, that should be probably unvalved curve, that's a 2200, so I can actually zoom in.

00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:05.760
And here's the level 2200.

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:11.560
Okay. Now I want partial h, partial x to be zero.

00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:17.600
That means if I change x, keeping y constant, the value of h doesn't change.

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:24.200
So which points on the level curve satisfy that property?

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:28.720
Yeah, it's the top and the bottom, okay.

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:33.660
If you are here, for example, and you move in the x direction,

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:42.800
well, you see as you get to where from the left, the height first increases and then decreases, it goes for a maximum at that point.

00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:49.360
So at that point, the partial derivative is zero with respect to x, and same here.

00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:58.200
Now we also told, and let's find partial h, partial y, less than zero.

00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:01.660
So that means if we go north, we should go down.

00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:06.260
Well, which one is it? Top or bottom?

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:08.120
Top. Yes.

00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:14.140
Here, if you go north, then you go from 2200 down to 2100.

00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:19.140
So this is where the point is.

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:27.060
So now the problem here was also asking you to estimate partial h, partial y, and just if you're curious how you would do that.

00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:32.520
Well, you would try to figure out how long it takes before you reach the next level curve.

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:37.660
Okay, and you see that so here, to go from here to here,

00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:52.760
so to go from q to this new point, say, q prime, the change in y, well, you'd have to read the scale, which was up, down here.

00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:58.380
Okay, that would be about something like 300.

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:03.760
What's the change in height when you go from q to q prime?

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:11.860
Well, you go down from 2200 to 2100, that's about, well, that's actually minus 100, exactly.

00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:19.540
Okay, and so delta h over delta y is about minus 1 third.

00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:25.760
Well, minus 100 over 300, which is, whoops, getting out of,

00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:30.060
minus 1 third.

00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:36.340
And that's the same, I mean, that's an approximation for the partial derivative.

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:39.520
Okay, so that's how you would do it.

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:46.920
Now, so, okay, let me go back to other things.

00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:54.840
So if you look at this practice exam, basically, there's a bit of everything, and it's kind of, you know, fairly representative of what might happen.

00:44:55.900 --> 00:45:01.300
On Tuesday, so, you know, there will be a mix of easy problems and of harder problems.

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:06.040
Expect something about, you know, computing, gradients, approximations, space of change.

00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:08.400
Expect a problem about reading the contour plot.

00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:13.420
Expect one about, you know, a min max problem.

00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:15.600
Something about Lagrange multipliers.

00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:19.480
Something about the chain rule, and something about constraint partial derivatives.

00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:21.920
I mean, pretty much all the topics are going to be there.
