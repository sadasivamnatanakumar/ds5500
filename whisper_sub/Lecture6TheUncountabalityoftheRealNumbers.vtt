00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.580
So we ended last time with some of these elementary properties

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.600
that you know about the absolute value.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.300
So prove one more theorem about the absolute value,

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.400
which maybe you didn't cover in calculus,

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:42.780
but it's a fundamental importance in real analysis,

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.300
which is the triangle inequality,

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.840
which states that for all x, y, and r,

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.780
the absolute value of x plus y,

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.880
this less than or equal to the absolute value of x

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.360
plus the absolute value of y.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.440
Okay, so y is a triangle inequality.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.160
Well, let me instead of x and y being real numbers,

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.260
let's think of these as vectors.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:29.860
So there's x, let's say y,

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:38.280
and then vector x plus y is this side.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.720
Then what this is stating is that the length of one of these sides

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.120
of this triangle is less than or equal to the sum of the two sides,

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.560
the sum of the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.280
So that's why it's called the triangle inequality.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.080
Okay, so proof is not very difficult,

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:21.580
although this inequality is probably one of the three most useful things

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.020
you'll learn in this class if you go on to study more analysis.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.520
The other one being, okay, so I'm coming,

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.280
this is knowledge from PDE,

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.860
so I guess I'm kind of viewing it through that lens of what I find useful in PDE's,

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.040
but triangle inequality integration by parts change a variables.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:48.840
Those three power the analysis machine that I'm most familiar with.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.980
So how to prove the triangle inequality,

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:03.660
if x and y is in r, then clearly by property number six,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.720
the x is less than or equal to the absolute value of x,

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.200
and y is less than or equal to the absolute value of y.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.800
So there's some is less than or equal to the absolute value of x plus y.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.780
And not only that, I can replace x by minus x,

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.220
and I get minus x plus minus y.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:33.560
This is less than or equal to the absolute value of minus x plus the absolute value of minus y,

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.220
but this is just absolute value of x plus y.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.180
And both of these therefore imply,

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.220
so if I just take this and multiply it through by minus one,

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.860
this inequality, which by number five,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.060
in the properties that we proved for the absolute value,

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:19.860
implies that the absolute value of x plus y is less than or equal to the absolute value of x,

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.320
plus the absolute value of y.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:32.200
So let me just make a remark about the reverse triangle inequality,

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:40.840
which will make an appearance in your assignment.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:47.320
And so this involves the absolute value of x minus y,

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.800
and the absolute value of the difference in the absolute values.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.240
Why is it reverse? Because the inequality reverses.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.060
The absolute value of x minus the absolute value of y,

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:12.040
take the absolute value, this is less than or equal to the absolute value of x minus y,

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.160
and you'll prove this in the assignment.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.640
So these two, so this follows from the triangle inequality,

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.900
but these two inequalities get used quite a bit,

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.600
and we'll use them quite a bit throughout the course.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.820
Okay?

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:41.940
All right, so let me take a minute to reconnect R with,

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.160
which you know and love from calculus, namely, decimals,

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.460
and we're going to use this fact about R to answer,

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.600
you know, a natural question that maybe you're asking yourself,

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.400
which is the following.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.480
So let me raise this as a question.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.020
So this first part is not a question.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.780
We've already addressed this in the first assignment,

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.480
the fact that the rationals is countable.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.460
In fact, you did it for the positive rationals,

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.760
but if the positive rationals are countable,

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.340
you can then prove that all rationals are countable,

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:32.940
and a natural question is R countable.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.040
Okay? It's a set of real numbers countable.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:36.480
Okay?

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.800
So in the end, not going to leave the end suspense,

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.040
the answer is no.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.800
And we're going to prove this, but let me just make a few remarks about what this says.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.760
So it's the following.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:07.980
So if Q, so this is not a proof of this,

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.520
I'm just going to make a remark based on this answer.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:23.160
So since R is uncountable,

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:30.380
and Q is countable,

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:37.460
this implies that R take away Q,

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:47.320
the set of irrational numbers is in fact uncountable.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:53.600
Why? So I'm just going to say in words why this is true.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.420
So suppose otherwise that both the rational numbers

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.280
and the irrationals are countable,

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:05.540
then you can map in a bijective fashion the rationales to the natural numbers,

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:11.320
and the irrationals also to the natural numbers,

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.900
but then you can map those natural numbers to zero minus one,

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:16.780
minus two, minus three, and so on.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
So then you find that there is a bijection from Q to the natural numbers,

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:26.940
and the irrationals to the integers less than or equal to zero,

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.100
and therefore there's a bijection from R to the integers.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:35.780
But the integers are countable, which would contradict the fact that R is uncountable.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.560
Therefore, the set of irrationals is uncountable.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.480
So in short, if you didn't follow that,

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:51.680
the set of irrationals is uncountable because otherwise this would force R to be countable.

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:56.500
Now I have improved yet that R is uncountable.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:00.900
We'll do that in just a minute, and we'll use a theorem about decimal expansions

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:04.000
for decimal representations of real numbers.

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:19.120
So now connecting rationals and irrationals to what you've seen since you were small.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:41.240
So to decimals, we typically think of rational numbers as in terms of decimal representations.

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:54.140
What does that mean? That means we take if x is in q,

00:09:54.640 --> 00:10:02.500
then we'll write x as some number times some digit times 10 to the k,

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:13.440
plus 10 to the k minus 1, plus d0, and then we go to the 10th spot,

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:19.480
so d minus 1, 10 to the minus 1, plus...

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.180
So this is discussion. I'm not stating any theorems right now,

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:33.660
until we get down to maybe some last decimal spot.

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:40.540
And with these digits,

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:55.340
a subset of 0, 1, 9.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:07.280
So all I'm saying is typically we think of x as this way, and then we write x as dk,

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:15.060
dk minus 1, d minus 1, d minus 2, and so on.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.000
I'm using this notation because I'm going to be...

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:27.060
This is a notation I need to state the theorem about the real numbers,

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.620
but it's quite silly that I'm about to write this down in this setting.

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:36.780
Welcome to MIT.

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:49.500
So, for example, 1 times 10, plus 1 times 10 to the 0,

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:53.900
plus 1 times 10 to the minus 1, right,

00:11:55.100 --> 00:12:00.540
this is supposed to represent the number 11.1.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:05.980
Which is the ration number.

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:25.800
It's quite funny that I had to think about that for a minute to go

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.660
from the decimal expansion to the rational numbers.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:31.900
But don't give me too hard of a time.

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.560
And a lot of at least pure math.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.940
We typically write things in rational numbers.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:43.780
I haven't had to write in decimal expansions quite some time.

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:51.100
Anyways, now of course not all rational numbers can be written as a finite decimal expansion.

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:58.740
For example, 1 third, you have to write as 0.333333, so on and so on.

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:05.820
So that's not necessarily covered under the discussion that I have right here.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:11.720
But it will be covered in what I'm about to state for the real numbers.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:18.220
So we could cover a third, and then we can also cover every real number

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:22.060
if we allow sort of infinite decimal representations.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:26.700
So I'll use the word decimal expansions or decimal representations interchangeably there.

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:31.120
So make a definition.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.580
And what I'm going to state is about real numbers between 0 and 1.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.220
Of course, if you want to talk about real numbers bigger than 1,

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:43.160
then you just tack on 1 to the, if you like, to the D0 place.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:55.880
So the infinite part is having to deal with what comes after the decimal point.

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:01.900
So the following, so this is a rigorous definition.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:18.000
Let x in 0, 1, excluding 0, and let D minus j be in 0, 1 to 9.

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:43.060
So we say x is, so what does it mean to say that x is given by an infinite decimal expansion

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:47.100
or given by an infinite decimal representation?

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:52.580
We say x is represented by the digits.

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:13.640
And we write x is equal to D minus 1, D minus 2, minus 3.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:27.920
So if, so this is a precise meaning of this, if x is equal to the supremum of the set.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:34.700
So I take a finite decimal expansion.

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:46.660
And then, so I get a number for each in a natural number.

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:52.160
So the first one is just D to D minus 1, 10 to the minus 1, and then for n equals 2,

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.280
I tack on next to 100th place, and then the 1000th place.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.720
And so I get a set of real numbers.

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:11.580
If I take it supremum, and I get x, then I say that x is represented by these digits or that x, or that this gives a decimal representation of x.

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:22.900
So that you see this lines up with what you know.

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:33.440
So if I look at 0.2, 500,000, remember this is now the soup of what?

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:39.200
Of a certain set. So let me do for this guy.

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:51.960
So this is 2 over 10, and then now I add the hundreds place plus 5 over 100, and then 2 over 10 plus 5 over 100.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:17:05.600
So this is a set. Remember, plus 0 over 1000 plus, so, and at each next guy, I'm supposed to take this and add on another 0.

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:22.900
So as a set, this is just a set containing two elements, namely two tents, and 25 over 100.

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:31.200
And so this is bigger than that guy, so the supremum is 25 over 100, which equals a fourth.

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:39.900
So all of that to tell you that yes, this definition should, or at least does, ring true with what you were taught.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.360
That 1.25 is equal to 0.25.

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.600
All right.

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:57.680
Okay. So now that we're done with the triangle inequality, we're going to erase this.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:21.620
So

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:40.420
this is the last bit of discussion about the elementary properties of the real numbers.

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.920
Next we'll be talking about sequences of real numbers.

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:52.580
Okay. So, all right. So I have this definition.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:19:08.240
The fundamental theorem about the real numbers is that every real number, at least in this setting, between 0 and 1, can be represented by a set of digits, or it has a decimal representation.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:17.920
In every decimal, if you like, every set of digits corresponds to a decimal representation of a real number.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:22.580
So let me state the second thing I said first.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:37.740
So for every set of digits, D minus J,

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:58.900
and then D minus J, each of these D minus J is in 0 up to 9.

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:26.200
Then there exists unique X in closed intervals 0, 1 such that X is equal to 1.

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:30.360
So with this decimal representation.

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:42.520
So you give me some digits, and I can find a unique real number that has that decimal representation.

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:51.160
Now before I state the second part of the theorem, this says that I give you digits, I get a unique real number.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:57.420
Now you ask about the other direction. If I have a real number, do I get a unique set of digits?

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:16.220
And of course, that is not true necessarily because for example, 1 half, this is equal to 0.5, 0, 0, and so on.

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:22.040
But this is also equal to 0.4, 9, 9, 9, and so on.

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:29.080
Yes, every set of digits gives me a unique real number.

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:35.960
So if I gave you these digits, they would spit out 1 half, and only 1 half, it wouldn't spit out a fourth.

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:49.440
But if you give me a real number, there does not necessarily exist a unique set of digits giving a decimal expansion for that number.

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:54.200
So I can have two different decimal expansions. I have 0.5, I have 0.4, 9, 9, 9.

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:57.380
I will always have at least one, but it's not necessarily unique.

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:13.540
But we can single out one unique choice by requiring that, in some sense, if I were to truncate it, then the decimal expansion would be less than the number I'm looking at, wanting to expand.

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:35.540
So that's the second part of this theorem. Is that for every x and 0, 1, now excluding 0, there exists unique digits.

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:56.200
And as before, these are in 0 up to 9, such that x is such that these give a decimal representation of x.

00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:05.720
And so what singles out of the choice if we're ever coming up against these two things?

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:19.880
And if I truncate the decimal expansion, so I'm not going to write zeros after that, I'm just going to truncate it.

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:31.280
This always is less than x, and this is less than or equal to plus 10 to the minus n.

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:44.800
So this inequality will always hold.

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:58.000
And in fact, so this inequality will always hold. And in fact, x is always bigger than or equal to this side, like no matter what.

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:09.720
If x is given by a decimal representation, so we always have these two, this is less than or equal to, and this is a less than or equal to.

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:16.480
But we single out a unique choice of decimal representation by choosing this to be a strict less than.

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:23.220
So then that forces us to choose this guy over this guy.

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:36.420
So for theorem 2, this would say that the unique representation that satisfies this for 1 half is given by 0.4999.

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:39.860
And for example, for 1 would be just 0.9999.

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:50.060
Because if I take this representation and cut it off, this is actually equal to 1 half and not less than 1 half.

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:58.240
Okay, so that was a lot of discussion about the theorem, but that was for a reason, because I'm not actually going to prove this theorem.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:12.140
It's not entirely difficult. It just uses the least upper bound property of the real numbers, but it's a little clunky to write down.

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:23.580
And what I'd rather do is just use this theorem to prove my answer, the answer to my question up there on whether r is countable or not.

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:29.180
In the textbook, there is a proof of this theorem which you can read.

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:45.540
Okay. Okay. So we're actually going to use this theorem to prove the following theorem due to cantor.

00:25:46.400 --> 00:26:13.020
So we just went from absolute values which maybe was not to shock an aw. Now to this theorem which to me is shock an aw is that following that the interval 0,1 is uncountable.

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:31.620
Okay. All right. So maybe you're asking yourself, well, that showing this is uncountable. And that saying r is uncountable.

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:41.380
So where do we go from this to that? Well, I'll let you think about that, but let's assume this was uncountable and r was countable.

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:59.460
So I'm just going to say this, say why out loud. If this was uncountable and r was countable, then since this is a subset of r, that means this under would be, so let me just write.

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:19.540
So it is this imply. And I'm going to give you kind of a fake proof, but you can actually make this completely rigorous.

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:42.800
Fake proof in the sense that I'm just going to write symbols that imply this. So why is our uncountable then if this is uncountable? Well, the function that takes an element in here just into r, this is clearly by objective.

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:47.860
So just the identity map from 0,1 into r is an injective map.

00:27:50.940 --> 00:28:00.760
So I clearly have that the cardinality of this set is less than or equal to the cardinality of r.

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:13.660
In fact, maybe you can think about it, maybe I'll put it on the assignment, but in fact, one can prove they have the same cardinality, but I have that.

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:19.920
And this is uncountable, therefore, its cardinality is bigger than the natural numbers.

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:29.160
So this should imply that cardinality of the natural numbers is less than cardinality of r.

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:34.140
In other words, r is uncountable.

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:40.720
All right, so let's prove this theorem due to Cantor.

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:49.780
Now this other theorem due to Cantor that the cardinality of the power set is bigger than the cardinality of the set.

00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:55.360
I mean, that was at least a proof.

00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:58.820
That was some crazy shit.

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:03.980
And this is also going to be some pretty crazy and clever shit, too.

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:13.300
So this is what's referred to as Cantor's diagonalization argument or diagonal argument.

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:15.140
It's the following.

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:16.740
So we're going to prove this by contradiction.

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:25.820
So we're going to assume that this is countable.

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:27.320
So it can't be finite.

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:30.280
There's infinitely many of elements in here.

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:41.940
So suppose that in fact it has the cardinality of the natural numbers.

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:47.960
And we're going to arrive at a contradiction.

00:29:49.380 --> 00:30:04.780
So then there exists a function which I'm going to call x from natural numbers into 0, 1, which is bijective.

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:31.460
Now, so let me label this inequality star.

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:38.740
For each n, we write x of n.

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:41.080
So this is an element of 0, 1.

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:41.920
So let me write x of n.

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:42.860
So this is bijective.

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:46.420
So every element in 0, 1 gets mapped on to.

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:52.080
So we write x of n to be in its decimal representation.

00:30:54.320 --> 00:31:02.640
I have two indices now, one for the digit place and the one for which.

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:08.340
Excuse me.

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:13.040
At least I sheltered you from that sneeze by putting my hand over the microphone.

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:14.620
The microphone's still on.

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:26.000
So for each n, we write each x of n in its decimal representation.

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:35.900
Satisfying star.

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:42.960
So each x in here can be written uniquely in a given decimal representation.

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:44.740
Satisfying this inequality here.

00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:55.980
Now what we're going to do is we're going to come up with a real number in the n.

00:31:55.980 --> 00:32:02.560
The interval 0, 1, which x does not map to, which therefore contradicts the fact that x is surjective.

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:08.660
Bijective surjective means that everything has to get mapped on to.

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:09.740
This is on to part.

00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:13.900
Injective means it maps different things to different things.

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:23.880
So what's kind of the idea of finding this element that doesn't get mapped on to?

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:29.260
So.

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:45.940
Let me write down just a few.

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.940
Of these decimal expansions.

00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:00.020
And I may not want to do a fourth one.

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:06.560
And maybe I do.

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:10.820
So this is again discussion.

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:12.040
So I'm going to put this in brackets.

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:17.360
Meaning this is not part of the proof, but this is part of the idea of what's going on.

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:22.180
And where's the diagonal part?

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:29.720
So.

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:34.640
And this should go off in this direction.

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:37.640
And the decimal expansions march off in that direction.

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:46.060
And so somehow this list, if it kept going in that direction, would have to contain every real number between 0 and 1.

00:33:47.440 --> 00:34:04.600
And so what's the idea to come up with a real number between 0 and 1 that is not in this list is we go down the diagonal of the decimal expansions.

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:10.320
And we change each decimal to something else.

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:12.340
Okay, then what it is.

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:18.380
And so therefore, and then I take my element y.

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:22.400
So remember we're trying to find a y.

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:29.800
Not in this list.

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:44.140
And then I would take y to be the real number that I get by changing each of these decimal digits.

00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:44.940
Okay.

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:53.620
So you can imagine if y somehow popped up, let's say it popped up since I don't want to write anymore as x4.

00:34:54.440 --> 00:35:01.620
Then somehow this number would have to be the digit for y, but I changed it.

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:03.500
And therefore it's not the digit of y.

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:03.560
Okay.

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:10.280
So you know, that's it in a nutshell.

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:13.880
If you didn't get that, that's fine.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.380
Let me now write out the details.

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:24.560
So you know, it's a little bit simpler to imagine if, let's say, all of these were 0 and 1.

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:26.760
So instead of being base 10, I was base 2.

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:33.340
Okay. And so instead of if the digit was a 0, I flipped it to 1.

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:41.520
So you can imagine that if y did, and then I form y by flipping the digits.

00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:49.280
Okay. So if this was 0, 0, 1, 1, then y would start off 1, 1, 0, 0.

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:50.080
Okay.

00:35:51.020 --> 00:36:01.320
And therefore if y appeared, say, fourth in line, it would have to be 1 and 0 in the same spot.

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:05.060
Okay. Just by how I've constructed y by flipping it.

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.260
And therefore y can't be in that list.

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:10.520
And therefore this map cannot be surjective.

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:12.780
All right. Which is our contradiction.

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:16.920
So let me make this more precise.

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:25.720
Let Ej, this is going to be 1.

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:40.540
If the jth digit of the jth x of j does not equal 1.

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:41.720
Okay.

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:44.360
2.

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:57.040
If the jth digit of the jth guy in that list or x of j does equal 1.

00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:58.040
Okay.

00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:58.040


00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:18.020
By part 1 of the theorem, previous theorem, there exists a unique y in 0, 1 without 0.

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:22.360
Why? Because some of these digits are non-zero.

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:23.840
It's always either 1 or 2.

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:36.520
Okay. Such that y is equal to e minus 1, e minus 2, and so on.

00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:37.140
Okay.

00:37:40.520 --> 00:38:06.020
So moreover since all of these digits are either 1 or 2, they are certainly non-zero.

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:13.880
So y is given by a decimal expansion where all of these things are non-zero.

00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:26.000
Okay. So that means that for all n, a natural number, if I take a finite decimal expansion,

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:33.260
so I cut this off at e to the minus n, since e to the e minus n plus 1 is either 1 or 2,

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:42.680
that's going to be positive. So that's less than y, and this is always the case that this is less than or equal to.

00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:57.680
Okay. So because all these digits are positive, if I cut it off, if I truncate it, then that number is going to be less than 1.

00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:04.620
Okay. Because I'm missing stuff out in the millions place or whatever, each time for each n.

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:26.680
Okay. And therefore, this decimal expansion is the unique decimal

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:34.680
representation from part 2 of the theorem, okay, that I stated. Right.

00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:39.540
Every element in 0, 1 has a unique representation satisfied in that inequality.

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:46.320
Because all of these digits are positive, this, in fact, is a unique representation of this element y,

00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:51.120
which I've constructed by flipping digits from this map.

00:39:51.120 --> 00:40:14.560
Okay. Now, since x is surjective, it exists an n, a natural number, you know, this n has nothing to do with that n.

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:22.840
And maybe I'll use a different letter m such that y equals x of m.

00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:35.800
Then, let's say I look at e to the minus m. Okay.

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:53.520
So then, this says that the m digit, which is, should be giving me e to the minus m, because this is equal to y.

00:40:53.520 --> 00:41:13.220
Okay. This, remember, is equal to 1 if dm 2, if dm equals 1.

00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:20.020
And in particular, this does not equal dm.

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:29.540
So I have proven that this number does not equal itself. Okay.

00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:40.740
I can never, if I can never have this number, whatever it is, equal to this thing, because I'm always changing it.

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:51.360
If this thing is 1, okay, then this number is 2. If this number is not 1, then this number is 1, and therefore it's not equal to that.

00:41:51.360 --> 00:42:10.960
Okay. And this is a contradiction. Thus, shows that, the set is uncountable.

00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:27.520
Okay. So I hope I explained that well enough. You can also look in the textbook for explanation as well.

00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:34.160
And of course, you can ask me in office hours for more explanation.

00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:48.580
Let me fuel up real quick. Okay. Now we're moving on to a new chapter.

00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:04.200
We're going to get to, now we're going to get to the analysis part.

00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:10.460
So analysis, as I've said before, is a study of limits, real analysis is a study of limits that has to deal with real numbers.

00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:21.840
So let's get to our first notion of a limit, and that is the limit of a sequence of real numbers.

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:33.120
So now we're moving on to sequences and series.

00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:41.040
Okay. So what is the precise definition of a sequence of real numbers?

00:43:45.040 --> 00:44:05.720
A sequence of real numbers is precisely a function x from the natural numbers into r.

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:14.000
Okay. Just a function. It doesn't have to be bijective, surjective, injective, anything. It's just a function from the natural numbers to r.

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:21.000
So that's precisely what a sequence of real numbers is. Now we typically don't think of a sequence as a function.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:47.540
In fact, we don't even use that notation. We denote x of n by x sub n, and the associated sequence by this curly brackets,

00:44:49.180 --> 00:45:01.180
n equals 1 to infinity, or we might not even write the n equals 1 to infinity part, or just start listing them.

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:21.660
Okay. So let me quickly say that although, so again, a sequence unambiguously defined is a function from the natural numbers to real.

00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:26.580
So don't confuse this with a set. Okay. A sequence is not a set.

00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:41.960
Think of a sequence, even though again, it's defined as a function as just a infinite listing of elements of r.

00:45:41.960 --> 00:46:00.380
Okay. The first element, the second element, the third element, and so on. Okay. And they don't have to be different. Okay. So for example, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, that is a perfectly good sequence.

00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:22.760
Okay. In terms of what is the function, this is x of n equals 1 for all n. But again, I will not think of really a sequence as a function just as we never thought about functions as subsets of the Cartesian product of two sets.

00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:36.820
You should really think of these as just a list of real numbers. Okay. And when we refer to them, we'll either write them like that, or with curly brackets around an expression for x sub n.

00:46:43.540 --> 00:47:02.120
So for example, if I were to write this, this means this is the sequence given by 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, and so on. Okay.

00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:05.120
Okay.

00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:32.120


00:47:56.100 --> 00:48:07.500
So here's another definition. So a sequence is bounded if in some sense it doesn't run off to arbitrarily large values.

00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:37.300
So a sequence x of n is bounded if there exists some real number b bigger than or equal to 0 such that for all n in the natural numbers.

00:48:38.460 --> 00:49:02.660
So x of n is less than or equal to b. In absolute value. Okay. So again, for example, if we take a look back at both of those two sequences, 1, 1, 1, and a sequence 1 over n, these are bounded.

00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:25.700
Why? Because every element in this, and I, every, I shouldn't say element, but every entry in this sequence is equal to 1. So it's bounded by 1. And every entry in this sequence is less than or equal to 1. So it's bounded by 1 in absolute values also positive. So they're both bounded.

00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:51.820
Another example is the sequence written minus 1 to the n. So, now, right, equals, although this shouldn't, this doesn't mean anything. I'm just going to write it, right at, we start listing the entries minus 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.

00:49:53.940 --> 00:50:07.980
This is also bounded because the absolute value of minus 1 to the n is 1. So that's bounded by 1 for all n. So what's a non-example?

00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:34.260
So the sequence in, in other words, this is the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on. Now precisely, why is it un, so I should say, this is bounded.

00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:45.260
Now, the other wise I'll refer to X of n as unbounded.

00:50:51.680 --> 00:51:09.220
So why is it unbounded because the entries are getting larger and larger in size? But if I were to ask you to prove this, you would have to show, and this is also a good first exercise, what does it mean to be unbounded?

00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:32.060
So I said this at one point that if you come across a reasonably interesting definition, you should look up or try to come up with examples. And typically, when you do come up with examples, you should come up with non-examples. And what that requires you to do is negate the definition. What does it mean for something to not be that?

00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:44.580
So even though I'm saying that if it's not bounded, I call it unbounded, I haven't actually written a mathematical statement to this effect on what this means.

00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:55.540
So let me make this right here as a remark. So a sequence is unbounded.

00:51:55.540 --> 00:52:11.220
So if it doesn't satisfy that definition, so we need to negate this definition. The definition says this is bounded if there exists a B bigger than or equal to 0 such that this holds for all n.

00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:21.540
Now, when I negate a there exists, that becomes a for all. And when I negate a for all, that becomes a there exists. And then I negate this condition.

00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:42.660
So the sequence is unbounded if for all B bigger than or equal to 0, there exists a natural number in n such that x n in absolute value is bigger than B.

00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:58.800
Now, using this, so this is, if you like, you can take that as a second definition or it's not really a definition since it's just the negation of the first definition.

00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:07.040
So the second definition, why is this set unbounded because of the Archimedean property?

00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:26.660
So now I'm giving you a little short proof on why this sequence is unbounded. Let B be bigger than or equal to 0 by Archimedean property.

00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:40.580
There exists a natural number in such that n is bigger than B, which is exactly what we wanted to prove because in this case, x sub n is n.

00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:17.860
Okay. Now, what does it mean for us to have a limit of a sequence? What does it mean for a real number to be the limit of a sequence?

00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:23.440
What does it mean for a sequence to converge to something?

00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:45.100
So sequence x of n converges to real number x and r if the following condition is satisfied.

00:54:48.300 --> 00:55:08.960
If for every epsilon positive, there exists a natural number of capital M such that for all n bigger than or equal to capital M, x n minus x, absolute value is less than epsilon.

00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:14.500
Now, remember the absolute value is meant to be something like a distance. So what does this statement say?

00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:31.220
This says if I give you a little bit of tolerance, epsilon, and you go far enough out in the sequence, then the distance between that entry in the sequence and x are very close to each other.

00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:42.300
Okay. Let me finish stating the rest of this definition that we'll do a little more discussion.

00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:57.360
If a sequence converges, we say it's convergent.

00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:10.120
Otherwise, we say it's divergent.

00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:24.500
Okay. Let me draw a little picture of what this meant to be.

00:56:26.060 --> 00:56:44.140
The real numbers, you know, it was this, I mean it is this unique ordered field with least upper bound property but when you think about the real numbers, think of it as you've always thought about it as just the real number line.

00:56:44.140 --> 00:57:02.000
So what does this definition mean? It means that a sequence converges to some x if for every epsilon, I can do the following.

00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:31.980
If I give you an epsilon and you go on either side of x, epsilon amount, then you should be able to find a capital M so that if you look at entries in the sequence,

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:37.380
then your sequence x of n for n bigger than or equal to M, they're in this guy.

00:57:38.100 --> 00:57:50.440
So then I should have x of m there, x of m plus 1, x of m plus 2, and in general, x of n should be in there as long as n is bigger than or equal to m.

00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:55.120
So I should be able to do this for every epsilon.

00:57:56.260 --> 00:58:11.980
So for any amount of tolerance epsilon, you should be able to go far enough out in the sequence that all entries in that sequence are within this tolerance of x.

00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:22.440
Okay.

00:58:43.140 --> 00:59:00.680
So, you know, I mean, although this is a picture of what the definition means, how should you, I mean, you've probably gotten plenty of experience with sequences when you were doing calculus.

00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:19.820
But what does this mean? You know, kind of loosely, it means if I look close to x, some little interval containing x, then all of the sequence, all of the elements of the sequence should be eventually in this little interval.

00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:35.380
Okay. Or another way to think about it is that as I go on in the sequence, the entries are getting closer and closer and closer to x.

00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:36.680
Okay.

00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:47.640
Now, the way one makes kind of these last two, you know, intuitive statements precise is via this definition.

00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:54.760
Okay. The closer and closer part is encapsulated in this for all epsilon part.

00:59:55.800 --> 01:00:02.140
And eventually getting closer and closer means for all n bigger than or equal to capital m.

01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:06.000
As long as I go far enough out in the sequence, they're getting close to x.

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:09.400
Okay. So, I hope that's pretty clear.

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:55.340
All right. So, again, we have a definition. We have, and it's reasonably interesting, so we should do examples and then also negate it.

01:00:56.360 --> 01:01:14.700
But before I do either of those, I do want to just prove a very simple fact about convergent sequences, namely that if I have a sequence which converges to x, then x is the only thing that sequence can converge to.

01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:20.220
All right. I cannot have a convergent sequence which converges to two different things.

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:32.300
Like I said, if you go by this intuition that eventually the x sub n's are getting closer and closer and closer to x, well, then there's no way they can be also getting closer to something other than x.

01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:39.820
Okay. So, I just want to prove that real quick and then we'll do examples and a negation of this definition.

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:58.940
So, following theorem. And so, I'm going to state first the theorem that has nothing to do with sequences, but is a nice way if you want to show two things or equal.

01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:21.320
You can show they're smaller than anything. So, the first theorem that I'm going to state is if x and y are in r and for all epsilon positive, x minus y is less than epsilon, then x equals y.

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:29.860
This is not a surprising statement. If I have x and y in the distance between them is arbitrarily small, then they have to be the same thing.

01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:48.420
Okay. So, what's the proof? Suppose x, y is in r and for all epsilon positive, x minus y is less than epsilon.

01:02:48.420 --> 01:03:01.340
So, now I want to prove x equals y. So, let's assume that this does not hold and arrive at a contradiction. So, this is a short proof by contradiction. Suppose x does not equal y.

01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:18.960
Then, remember we proved that the absolute value of something is zero if and only if that thing is equal to zero and it's always non-negative.

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:46.540
So, x not equal to y means the absolute value of x minus y is less than is bigger than zero. Then, by this assumption for epsilon equal to x minus y over two, I get, which implies if I just subtract that over, x minus y is less than zero.

01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:56.700
So, one half is less than zero and that's a very false statement. We've already proven that the absolute value is always non-negative.

01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:05.740
Okay. So, if I have two real numbers that are arbitrarily close to each other, then they have to be the same.

01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:26.220
Okay. I'm going to use this theorem to prove that y put one there. Y limits, and I have not said, that's what we call x, but y, a convergent sequence, can only converge to one thing.

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:49.120
So, here's the statement of the second theorem. If x sub n is a sequence and it converges to x, and it also converges to y, the next equals y.

01:04:49.120 --> 01:05:14.800
So, a convergent sequence can only converge to one thing. Okay. And again, like I said, there should be clear because what's happening is, if I have two things that are not equal and x have been converges to x, that means as long as I go far enough out in the sequence, they're supposed to be here, and this small interval around x.

01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:35.640
Well, if they're supposed to be converging to y, if I go far enough out, they're also supposed to be over here, as long as I go far enough out. But you can't be in two places at once, ever, and so that's what x must equal y.

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:52.720
Okay. Although I suppose that now we're doing all the classes online, so I'm going to record it so you can be two places at once, but at least not here.

01:05:54.440 --> 01:06:20.740
Okay. So, we're going to use this theorem to prove this statement. Suppose, converges to x and y. And I want to verify that for all epsilon positive, the absolute value of x minus y is less than or equal to epsilon.

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:38.820
Okay. Now, remember, if I'm proving something for all epsilon, I have to, that means I do it for arbitrary epsilon. You get points just for saying let epsilon be positive.

01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:47.120
Okay. Now, I want to show the absolute value of x minus y is less than or equal to epsilon. And we're basically going to do the argument that I just erased.

01:06:49.400 --> 01:07:12.760
So, since x of n converges to x, that implies that there exists a natural number m1 such that we're all in bigger than or equal to m1.

01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:31.080
So, x of n minus x is less than epsilon over 2. Why the epsilon over 2? You'll see magic happens. And since x of n converges to y,

01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:52.760
that's this implies that there exists an m2 natural number such that for all n bigger than or equal to m2. So, again, this is a part that says as long as I go far enough out, x of n has to be close to x.

01:07:52.760 --> 01:08:05.020
Now, this is a part that says as long as I go far enough out, x of n has to be close to y. So, that for all n bigger than or equal to m2, x of n minus y is less than epsilon over 2.

01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:34.900
Then, since the sum m1 plus these are both natural numbers, this is bigger than or equal to m1. And m2, this implies now I'm going to use these to any qualities and the triangle inequality.

01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:54.620
Then, if I look at the absolute value of x minus y, this is equal to the absolute value of x minus x of n plus x of n minus x of n, but x of m1 plus m2,

01:08:56.180 --> 01:09:14.520
plus x of m1 plus m2. Now, by the triangle inequality, this is less than or equal to x of n plus m1 plus m2 minus y.

01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:32.840
Now, this is less than epsilon over 2 because m1 plus m2 is bigger than or equal to m1. And for the same reason, since m1 plus m2 is bigger than or equal to m2, this is less than epsilon over 2.

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:47.200
Now, you see why I divided both of those by 2 because when I add them up, I get epsilon. So, I've shown that for every epsilon positive, the absolute value of x minus y is less than epsilon.

01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:04.240
And therefore, by the theorem that I proved a minute ago, x equals y.

01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:19.200
Why did I say that theorem because I want to use notation and I want this notation to be already apparent that it's consistent?

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:23.800
And I'm going to use terminology.

01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:38.040
So, this is not really a new definition, it's just some terminology.

01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:50.040
Let's see.

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:17.460
Now, the fact that I've shown only that there's only one guy that a sequence can converge to is why I get to use the word d. So, not we call x a limit of x of m. It's d limit because there's only one.

01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:31.780
If one exists, n right, x equals limit as n goes to infinity of x of n.

01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:57.040
So, let's pause on negating the definition of what it means for a sequence to be convergent and let's do a couple of examples of convergent sequences proving that they are convergent sequences and computing what they,

01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:04.660
and at least proving that these sequences do converge to the limit that I'm telling you.

01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:12.960
So, for example, let's look at the constant sequence x of n equals 1.

01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:25.800
So, that's the sequence 1, 1, 1, so on. Then I'm just going to write 1 not x of n.

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:35.140
So, limit as n goes to infinity of 1 equals 1. This proof is not very enlightening.

01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:51.740
So, but I'll show you how it goes. So, you're supposed to show what does this mean? This means for every epsilon positive, there exists a natural number capital m such that if I'm bigger than capital m, this minus the limit should be less than epsilon.

01:12:51.740 --> 01:13:02.920
So, let epsilon be positive. I have to now come up with a capital m so that x of n minus x is less than epsilon whenever little n is bigger than or equal to capital m.

01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:29.820
So, I'm going to choose capital m to be 1. I can do that for this sequence. Then, if n is bigger than or equal to m, and I look at the entry in the sequence, well, this is just 1, minus 1 equals 0, and that's less than epsilon.

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:48.760
So, not very enlightening because capital m equals 1 is good enough. So, let's do something a little more. So, how about the limit as n goes to infinity of 1 over n equals 0?

01:13:51.480 --> 01:14:08.220
So, let's do a proof of this. Again, I'm supposed to be proving this epsilon statement in the definition in order to be able to state this.

01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:27.360
So, which is for every epsilon statement, so I start to proof off with let epsilon be positive. Now, I have to tell you how to choose capital m to ensure that little n bigger than or equal to capital m implies x of n minus 0 in this case is less than epsilon.

01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:46.940
So, I will say choose capital m, natural number, such that m is bigger than 1 over epsilon. In fact, I'm not going to write it that way. I'm going to write it this way.

01:14:49.740 --> 01:15:16.880
1 over m is less than epsilon. And why can I do this? Why can I find such a natural number that satisfies this? You can't just insert statements into your proof, choose capital m to satisfy the unicorn property and not clarify why you can choose such a natural number that satisfies the unicorn.

01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:30.240
So, I can do this by the Archimedean property. This is equivalently stating that I can find a natural number m so that m is bigger than 1 over epsilon, what I have written there originally.

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:53.000
So, let me write it this way. Such m exists by the Archimedean property of the natural numbers. I'll say that a few times if I have to clarify why certain natural numbers satisfying certain properties exist.

01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:59.360
And then at one point I'll just stop because it should be clear that I've done it enough times, you know how or why something does exist.

01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:15.520
So, I choose a natural number m so that I have this. Now I need to show you that this number works.

01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:33.740
Let n be bigger than capital m. Then if I look at x sub n minus my proposed limit which is 0, so I look at 1 minus n 0, this is equal to just 1 over n.

01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:43.760
Since little n is bigger than or equal to capital m, this is less than or equal to capital m which is less than epsilon.

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:56.500
And therefore I've proven what I wanted to prove. So, how do these, you know if I just give you a sequence and I ask you to prove that.

01:16:57.240 --> 01:17:13.700
So, this is some discussion. You know how do you come up with these proofs? How should the proof typically look? If I want to prove equals L or x.

01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:25.460
You know what's the proof of that look like? It should always, so the proof should be let epsilon be positive. And then maybe you need to do some explaining.

01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:45.620
And then you'll say choose m so that something. And that such an m exists probably will be explained there.

01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:55.160
Or in the same sentence. And then the next part of the proof should be showing that this capital m works.

01:17:56.280 --> 01:18:13.360
So then if n is bigger than or equal to capital m, then you should show that it works by looking at x sub n minus x doing calculation or inequalities and arriving at this being less than epsilon.

01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:23.260
Which is what you're wanting to prove. You're wanting in the end to verify this definition. Which says for every epsilon you can find a capital m so that I get this.

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:32.340
So in a proof, you are carrying that out. You're saying for epsilon positive, I choose m so that this happens.

01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:54.060
Now, how do you come up with such a capital m? So again, this is just discussion and maybe we won't get to any more examples.

01:18:54.060 --> 01:19:08.220
I'll just finish this discussion. And then we'll call it a day. How do you come up with such a capital m? How did I come up with m? Why did I choose m in this way?

01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:25.900
In the end, you can see it here is that I chose it because if I fiddle around with the thing I want to bound, I ended up with 1 over m, which I can control and make it smaller than epsilon.

01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:55.880
So typically, how do you find capital m? So this is a discussion, I guess, within a discussion. Typically, you'll take x of n minus x, your proposed limit. Maybe I give you a sequence explicitly or maybe it's an expression in volume.

01:19:55.880 --> 01:20:15.000
So you're solving some other sequences. And you fiddle around with it. Maybe you write it differently or add and subtract something or multiply it by 1 in a fancy way. And you'll get some expression typically involving something involving m.

01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:41.500
And as long as this expression involving m is simple enough, then you choose capital m so that this thing is less than epsilon. Now, simple enough, for example, 1 over m, I can choose capital m so that this is less than epsilon by the R-comedy in property.

01:20:42.680 --> 01:21:10.880
If, for example, and that's basically 1 over m or 5 over m or something like that, that kind of exhausts all the simplest ones for now. But if, for example, you ended up with 1 over m squared minus 3m minus plus 100, I would not say this is a simple enough expression to be able to say choose capital m so that this is less than epsilon.

01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:27.880
Without more explanation than what I just gave here. And we'll do some more examples next time to flesh this out a little bit more.

01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:30.860
All right, so we'll stop there.
