00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.340
So let's continue our discussion of sequences of functions.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.720
So we had two different notions of convergence of sequences of functions.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.280
So the first notion was point wise convergence.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:46.520
So we have a sequence of functions fn from some set s to r.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.200
Another function, fixed function s from f from s to r.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:01.720
And then we say f converges to fn converges to f point wise,

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:10.800
because if for every x and s, the sequence of real numbers converges to f of x.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:23.780
So if we're all x and s, the limit as n goes to infinity of fn of x equals f of x.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.580
So I take an x out of s, stick it into fn.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.140
So now I get a sequence of real numbers, and I should get f of x as n goes to infinity.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.000
And then we introduced a stronger notion of convergence of functions,

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.320
which was the following.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:53.140
So we have a sequence going from s to r, function from s to r.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:10.400
Then we said fn converges to f uniformly on s, if somehow across the entire set,

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.960
that fn gets close to s. Any f?

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.100
So here, the statement says if I take us for each fixed x, eventually fn of x,

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.160
so fn evaluated at that point is close to f of x.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:31.440
f evaluated at that point. But uniform convergence says fn is close to f across the entire set.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.900
So if for all epsilon positive, there exists natural number m,

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.960
so that we're all in bigger than or equal to m, we're all x and s,

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:54.380
fn of x minus f of x is less than epsilon.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.240
Now if you write out what this means in terms of epsilon m,

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:07.600
remember this is a limit, so this is a limit of sequences, so this means something in terms of epsilon and m.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.300
This would say for all x and s, for all epsilon positive, there exists an m, so on.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.540
So the x appears at the front of this definition,

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.420
while here for uniform convergence, it appears at the end.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:36.640
That is not just meaningless difference in the way you write the definition,

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:43.720
meaning this is a stronger statement than if the x is appearing here,

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.820
so what am I going on about?

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:55.120
So first off, we proved last time that if I have a sequence of functions,

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:10.100
again from some subset s to r, converging to f uniformly, then this implies fn converges to f point wise.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:24.080
But now what I'm going to prove is that in fact uniform convergence is something stronger than point wise convergence.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:31.260
In other words, this is a one way street. Point wise convergence does not imply uniform convergence.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:48.940
And we were just going to look at a very specific example, which I was going to state as a theorem,

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.840
which is a following.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:04.940
fn of x, b, x to the n, and now we're looking on the unit interval 0, 1.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:23.440
And let f be the function that is 0 if x is in 0, 1, 1, x equals 1.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:45.840
So first off, let me from last time, or you can even just check by looking at the form of fn that fn converges to f point wise.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:57.980
If I take x in this interval here, so not equal to 1, then x is strictly less than 1.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.520
And if I raise it to a high enough power over and over again, that's converging to 0.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:08.240
So it converges to f of x 0. Now at 1, I just get 1 and that clearly converges to 1.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.920
So fn converges to f point wise.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:29.060
And so the claim is that for all, b between 0 and 1, fn converges to f.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.040
And I guess I could include 0. That would just be looking at one point.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:37.640
And not very interesting, but fn converges to f uniformly.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:50.960
And the second is fn does not converge to f uniformly on the whole interval, however.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:07:03.720
So maybe it's best to, again, draw this picture that you're supposed to think about when it comes to uniform convergence.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:22.080
So we have the limiting function fn, I mean f. And then we draw a little epsilon-size collar around the function f.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.860
And then uniform convergence, so this is f.

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:40.240
Uniform convergence says that as long as I go far enough out, the graph of fn should be within this little epsilon collar.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:45.160
So that fn is getting close to f uniformly across the entire set.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:08:01.780
So number two will give us a chance to negate this definition of uniform convergence, which, like I said, you should always.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:16.480
So we're actually doing two things here. We're giving an example of uniform convergence and also a sequence of functions, which does not converge uniformly to this function.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:21.580
So we're doing both an example and non-example, which is the best thing to do for a new definition.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:27.440
So, for the proof of one, let's prove uniform convergence.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:52.460
So let b be in 0,1. Then the limit as n goes to infinity of b to the n is 0, which implies, okay, so now I'm getting ahead of myself.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:08.420
So now we want to prove uniform convergence of fn to f on, I didn't finish this statement, fn to f uniformly on, sorry about that, b.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:17.340
So I have uniform convergence on any smaller interval, other than 0,1.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:31.460
Okay, sorry about that if that looked a little weird. Okay, so then b in converges to 0 as n goes to infinity.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:44.180
Now we want to prove that fn converges to f uniformly on this interval 0b. So let epsilon be positive. We now have to find an m so that fn is close to 0,

00:09:44.180 --> 00:10:05.240
because f is 0 on such an interval. Now since b to the n converges to 0, there exists natural number m such that we're all n bigger than or equal to m.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:26.900
Then b to the n is less than epsilon. Then we're all n bigger than or equal to m. We get, and also for all x, 0b, we get that fn of x minus f of x.

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:46.160
So b is less than 1. So when I stick it into f, I just get 0. This is equal to x to the n minus 0. And absolute value is just x to the n because we're on, we're looking at non-negative x.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:58.220
And now x is n, this interval 0b, so it's less than or equal to b. So x of the n is going to be less than or equal to b to the n. And this is less than epsilon.

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:19.420
So just as when we looked at uniform continuity of a function, it was a statement like for all epsilon, there exists a delta, which just depends on basically the epsilon and the function.

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:34.280
Now for uniform convergence, it looks kind of like pointwise convergence, except now for every epsilon you can find an m, which does not depend on the point x.

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:49.500
So for every epsilon, you can find an m depending only on epsilon and maybe the function little f. But that doesn't depend on x. This n here that I chose m, dependent only on b.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:55.580
Not the point x, which I have to stick into this here.

00:11:55.580 --> 00:12:18.440
Okay. Okay. So now, let's prove number two. So first off, let's negate the definition so that we know what we're talking about.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:35.220
So f n does not converge to f uniformly on a set s if there exists a bat. So every for all becomes there exists.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:49.540
Okay. So if there exists some bad epsilon not positive so that we're all m, natural number, there exists an n bigger than or equal to m.

00:12:50.540 --> 00:13:04.260
And there exists an x in s so that f n of x minus f of x is bigger than or equal to epsilon not.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:21.320
Okay. So, you know, this is the negation but why should we not be surprised that f n does not converge to f uniformly on zero one if you believe this picture.

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:37.360
So let's look at what's going on here. So let me draw now the graph of f.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:46.260
And let's say I take epsilon to be, I don't know, a fourth. Say.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:56.700
Okay. So.

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:09.520
Okay. Now this is what my little epsilon neighborhood of f looks like.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:26.720
Or epsilon tube is, you know, it's right along or for epsilon equals a fourth say. It's, you know, a tube around zero up to x equals one. And then, you know, it's a little area around one.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:43.060
And now if I were to have uniform convergence, then as long as n is very large, f n has to be within this area that I've, that I have here. So, you know, in fact, let me shade it in.

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:53.060
So, for f n large, it has to be within this region that I'm coloring in.

00:14:53.060 --> 00:15:16.680
All right. But now what do we know about x to the n? Well, you know, it starts at zero and ends at one and looks something like that, which means here always it leaves this, you know, epsilon two around f, this epsilon color, I guess.

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:21.680
All right.

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:50.020
epsilon f n leaves the shaded area, which is where it's supposed to stay. So I hope this, you know, intuitive def, you know, explanation is clear. And, and why it shouldn't be too big of a surprise that f n does not converge to f uniformly on zero one. We'll see another reason and little bit why it's impossible for f n to converge to f uniformly when we talk about the interchange of limits.

00:15:50.020 --> 00:16:19.360
But just using the definition we can prove that f n does not converge to f uniformly. So, all right. The negation is for all is that there exists a bad and epsilon zero so that we have all of this. So, you know, the point is to choose epsilon so that this never intersects with this epsilon neighborhood of the function down here.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:34.500
Never intersects with this epsilon neighborhood of just, you know, the point x equals one y equals one. So, let's choose epsilon not to be a fourth.

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:48.560
Okay. So, now we have to prove for all n there exists to n so let m be a natural number.

00:16:52.520 --> 00:17:10.100
Choose n to be m and choose x to be, let's say, one over four to the one over m.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:28.520
Now, this is a number less than one so its mth root is less than one and also positive. Then this f of x equals zero.

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:53.580
So, and f sub m of this x which is just one over four to the one over m now raised to the mth power is one over four which implies that f of m of x minus f of x is equal one fourth which equals epsilon zero.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:59.080
I guess if you like, you can write bigger than or equal to epsilon zero.

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:20.660
Okay. So, yeah, basically if you choose any, so there was nothing special about epsilon zero being one fourth. You choose anything less than one that would do.

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:33.340
Okay. Just, you can check that if I chose one half here, I could then choose this point x where f m is far away from f of x to be one over one half to the one half to the one over m.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:38.300
Okay. Just as long as I don't choose, you know, epsilon zero to be equal to one.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:19:05.140
Okay. So, so we have that example and, you know, we had another sequence of functions we had looked at last time,

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:14.140
which were these functions that looked like little, that looked like tenths. I don't know why I'm making this axis bigger when it should be the other one.

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:35.100
So, there's one, one over n, one over two n, and then way up here two n. So, at this point, and then it's piecewise linear.

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:50.000
So, then it's just a straight line down to here. I'm not going to write down exactly the equation for each piece, but and then zero to one.

00:19:50.960 --> 00:20:05.360
So, this is f n, and we proved that, so last time we proved that f n converges to the function zero point wise.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:28.800
But it does not converge uniformly to zero. Again, what's the point? The point here is that, you know, if I were to draw a little epsilon collar around the function zero, it would look something like this.

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:42.860
And f n would have to be within this little strip for all insufficiently large, but, you know, f n is getting taller and taller, so it always leaves, you know, kind of any strip that I put around the function zero.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:53.140
So, f n does not converge to zero uniformly. We can make a proof out of that, though. So, f n does not converge to zero uniformly.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:21:05.160
So, I should always tell you where I'm talking about, and this should be zero one.

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:23.120
So, why not? Well, we can take any epsilon zero, really. So, let's choose epsilon zero to be one. Let m be a natural number.

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:41.740
So, we should find n and an x, so that this inequality is satisfied. So, let's choose n to be m, x to be 1 over 2 m, this point where I peak, yeah.

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:58.720
Then, f of m of x minus f of x, now, f here is just zero. The limiting function is zero. So, let me not even put f, let me put just zero.

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:12.640
So, f m of 1 over 2 m, which equals 2 m, and this is certainly bigger than or equal to 1, which is epsilon zero.

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:38.180
Okay? Now, and in a little bit, I'll give you a whole host of examples. It seems like I've only given you one example up to this point of functions which converge uniformly to zero to something.

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:49.740
But, in a minute, I'll give you a very useful test to decide when a series involving functions converges uniformly.

00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:09.700
But, before we get to that, let's revisit these three questions that we asked in the last lecture in the context of power series, but now in this more general setting of convergence of functions.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:38.760
So, now what I'm talking about, and this is really, although I'm about to say may sound a bit alarming that we're now in essentially the last week of the class, and we're really getting to the first real part of analysis.

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:58.740
So, I was talking with a professor from Duke one time, and he made this funny observation that somehow in math, and I think this is not just math, but this is a lot of science-based classes, are taught.

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:17.660
But, you know, if you were to translate it into studying a book, it's like you spend a year studying, you know, introductions to a book, and then you spend a year studying middle parts of books, and then you spend another year studying the last parts of books.

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:30.180
So, now here we're starting to get into the middle part of the book of analysis, not the textbook, we're at the end of that, but at least in the grand scheme of things, which is the interchange of limits.

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:35.960
You have two limiting processes that you want to interchange.

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:54.700
Okay, and analysis, you know, first God created the limit, and then man asked, can we interchange limits? And so, what do I mean by that? This is not always, you know, a thing you can do.

00:24:54.700 --> 00:25:13.580
So, and this is, at the very heart of analysis, when can we interchange limits? So, let me give you the simplest example. Let's say we have the following limit.

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:27.020
So, I take the limit as k goes to infinity of the limit as n goes to infinity of n over k, n over k, plus 1. So, that's just a sequence depending on n and k.

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:46.720
Now, as n goes to infinity, what do I get? This is just equal to, like in, you know, multiply the bottom by k to get rid of this one. So, then I just get n over n plus k. Remember, k is fixed. And then I take the limit as n goes to infinity. So, I get 1.

00:25:47.460 --> 00:26:03.520
So, I'm taking the limit as k goes to infinity of this expression. Now, for each k, when I take the limit as n goes to infinity, I get 1. So, I get 1 there. Now, what happens if I interchange the limit?

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:17.660
And now, look at the limit as n goes to infinity of the limit as k goes to infinity of n over k, n over k, plus 1.

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:32.940
Well, now, as k goes to infinity for each n. So, remember, I'm taking the limit as n goes to infinity of this expression, which is formally this expression, what the limits interchange.

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:47.440
This is equal to 0 over 0 plus 1 equals 0. And these two do not equal each other. So, it's not always the case that you can interchange limits.

00:26:51.180 --> 00:27:06.080
That's the simple fact of life. And, you know, to be able to make certain statements, do certain computations, you know, you need to be able to interchange limits.

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:26.380
And, you know, what kind of limits may be taking an infinite sum and integrating, or like we stated in the beginning, you know, power series are, in a sense, a certain limit. There are a limit of partial sums of, there are a limit of polynomials, right?

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:44.860
And then, let's say, differentiation, that's a limit. So, if a natural question, like we said last time, is the derivative of this infinite sum, the infinite sum of the derivative. Those are two limiting processes, processes, which we're asking, can we interchange?

00:27:44.860 --> 00:28:14.840
Okay? So, the three questions, again, that I asked in terms of power series, I'm going to now frame, again, in this general setting. So, if f in from s to r, f from s to r, and f in converges to f, maybe point one, and f is the same.

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:23.240
We have x and y are uniformly. So, let's leave this open ended for now, because these are the only two notions we have of convergence.

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:43.640
And let me make, so suppose fn is from s to r, f is s to r, and fn converges to f point

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:51.400
y is on, or uniformly. And so this sentence is not written very well, and fn is continuous

00:28:51.400 --> 00:29:05.600
for all n, then is f continuous. So suppose we have a sequence of continuous functions

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:13.180
converging to another function f, either point y is or uniformly, is the limiting function

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:16.900
continuous. And I'll explain in a minute why this is a limiting, you know, kind of asking

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:34.260
can we interchange two limits. Second question is suppose fn from a b to r is differentiable

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:52.180
for all n, f from a b to r. And we have that fn converges to f, you know, either point

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:58.760
y is or uniform, we're leaving this open ended for now. And the derivatives also converge,

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:20.120
say to some function g, then is f, differentiable, and is the limit of the derivatives equal

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:33.860
to the derivative of the limit. And then the last question, so this is the third kind

00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:47.360
of main limiting process we've seen in this class, which is integration. Suppose fn

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:08.320
converges to f again, maybe either point y is or uniformly, we're leaving this open

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:21.140
ended for now, does the limit of the integral equal the integral of the limit.

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:40.580
Now, again, I want you to, you know, it's really, I guess, more clear here, the fact that

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:46.960
we're asking about interchanging two limits. So here we have this integration is just a symbol

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:52.320
for taking this limiting process, right, where you take a sequence of partitions of a b with

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:57.820
norm converging to zero, then the integral from a to b of fn, this is defined to be this limit

00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:05.940
of remonsums, right. So this is a limiting process here, although I'm writing it with this simple

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:11.980
notation, so I'm asking it, can I take this limit as n goes to infinity, and can I interchange it

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:20.220
with this limiting process. Now, for continuity, it's kind of maybe a little more hidden on what's

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:27.360
the interchange of limits that you're really looking at. So it looks more like this, so remember,

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:50.560
so for one, we're asking, you know, suppose x is in set s, xn is the sequence converging to x,

00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:11.220
then basically, can we do this? Now, I would like to show that f of x is equal to the limit as n goes

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:22.600
to infinity of f of x of n, so let me actually make this a m, let me use two different, let's use a k.

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:33.100
So if I compute limit as k goes to infinity of f of x of k, I would like to show that equals f of x,

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:38.940
if I'm trying to show that the limit is continuous, assuming the functions that are converging to f are

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:44.140
continuous, if I look at the limit as k goes to infinity, then I'm tempted to do the following that this is

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:55.620
equal to the limit as k goes to infinity of the limit as n goes to infinity of f of x, assuming either

00:33:55.620 --> 00:34:08.400
point-wise convergence or uniform convergence, xk. And now, if I'm, you know, just being a little bit

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:17.920
careless, I interchange limits and write this as the limit as n goes to infinity of the limit as k goes to infinity,

00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:28.680
so here is kind of where I'm asking, can I interchange limits? Again, this is not a proof, this is discussion on what is the

00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:35.300
interchange of limits that I'm looking at for question number one. Question number three is more clear, and then, you know,

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:42.040
for this, once I've done this, you know, different stability will be a little bit clear on what is the, you know,

00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:50.620
interchange of limits I'm looking at. So let's say I was, you know, just doing whatever I like and going through this,

00:34:50.720 --> 00:35:02.060
then I would, you know, interchange these limits. And since each of these f's are continuous, then the limit as k goes to

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:14.180
infinity of fn of x of k, and x of k converges to x, this just gives me fn of x. And so, and since fn again converges to f, in some sense,

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:25.800
this should give me f of x, right? So what I'm asking is, was all this okay? Because at some point, at this point, in particular, I had to interchange a limit.

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:33.300
Yeah? And we've just seen that we can't always do that. We can't always interchange limits and get the same thing.

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:41.240
Here, we got one, when we interchange the limit, we got zero. So it's not always the case that I can interchange limits.

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:51.700
This equality between this limit and the interchange limit is the big question mark. So that's the whole basis for question number one.

00:35:54.700 --> 00:36:06.040
Okay, so I hope that discussion wasn't, was clear enough. Now, the answer to these three questions is, in fact, yes.

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:11.360
But only for uniform convergence.

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:19.780
If f, if all, if the convergence,

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:48.160
and this is the mode of convergence we must have, so that the answer to all of these three questions, which is, you know, will state and prove as theorems is, is our correct.

00:36:51.640 --> 00:37:00.040
Now, you know, the natural question is, what if we have a weaker hypothesis, namely, what if we only assume point wise convergence?

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:13.100
Is the answer to any of these questions, yes. And, well, no. Okay, so the answer to all three of these questions is, no, if we only assume point wise convergence.

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:40.880
So let's go through an example showing that each of these three questions is no.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:49.260
So, if we only assume point wise convergence. So let's look at an example showing one is no.

00:37:49.260 --> 00:38:03.800
So if we only assume point wise convergence, and we basically already have it on the board, fn of x to be x to the n on zero one.

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:12.120
x is n.

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:28.880
Okay, then each of these functions, so, and for all n, fn is a continuous function on zero one.

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:45.700
fn converges to f point wise, but f itself is not a continuous function.

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:54.260
Okay, so this provides an example of a sequence of functions which converges point wise to a function which is not continuous.

00:38:54.260 --> 00:39:03.840
Okay, again, what I was saying there in the answer is that if I have a sequence of functions which converges uniformly to a function f, then that function is continuous.

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:10.000
Here, if we only assume point wise convergence, we may not get a continuous function in the end.

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:16.540
All right, and this is what this example shows. fn of x equals x to the n. These are all continuous functions.

00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:20.460
They converge to a function which is not continuous point wise.

00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:29.300
Okay, and that's, you know, okay, I'll say something else in a minute.

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:31.880
So let's look at example two now.

00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:43.120
Basically, we take the previous example and kind of integrate it to get an example of a sequence of functions with that converges and its derivative converges point wise.

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:57.880
So, we're two take fn of x to be x to the n over n on zero one.

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:03.440
Then, a couple of things.

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:06.860
fn converges to zero.

00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:18.620
fn prime converges to the function f which is the same function from here.

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:29.320
So let me actually make this g.

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.680
Okay, and these are point wise.

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:50.600
So I have a sequence of differentiable functions that converge point wise to something and the derivatives also converge point wise to something.

00:40:50.600 --> 00:41:05.480
And, but, so let's call f equals zero, but g is not equal to f prime.

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:09.040
The derivative of f, the constant function zero is zero.

00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:15.860
g is equal to this function which is zero if x is n zero one and one if x is equal to one.

00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:21.800
So here we see that the derivative of the limit is not the limit of the derivatives.

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:26.160
If we only assume point wise convergence of the functions.

00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:37.020
Now, the last example showing that three does not hold if we only assume point wise convergence is also on the board.

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:39.600
It's the whole point of this one up there.

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:46.080
So, let's go in the next board.

00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:27.040
So, here fn from zero to one to r is the function, this tent function, one over n, one over two n, two n.

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:44.900
It's just piecewise linear so it's zero from one over n to one and it goes up to one over two n, two n and then back down to the origin.

00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:54.500
And so we know that fn converges to zero point wise.

00:42:57.140 --> 00:42:59.520
Now, the integral of zero is just zero.

00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:03.460
Let's look at the integral of fn from zero to one.

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:11.240
The integral of zero one of fn.

00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:26.880
Now, if we were all together, this would be the point where I stop and ask if anybody can remember the area of a triangle, even though we're in this advanced analysis class.

00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:34.060
But I don't get to ask you that. I get to just ask myself that and I know the answer because I'm prepared and only because of that.

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:38.120
This is one half base times the height.

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:55.160
So, remember the integral is an area and I could write down the formula of what this function is and actually integrate it out using the fundamental theorem of calculus.

00:43:55.160 --> 00:44:07.080
But just go with me on this that the integral of fn is just the area of this triangle that has base starting at zero and going to one over n and it peaks at two n.

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:15.240
So, the base is one over n. The height is two n.

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:22.240
So, this equals one for all n. See, this is why I was making it peak.

00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:38.260
So, the integral from zero to one, which is just one for all n, does not converge to the integral of the limit.

00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:50.300
So, in this case, the limit of the integrals is not the integral of the limit.

00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:55.760
If we only, in what's the reason because we only have point wise convergence, right?

00:44:56.380 --> 00:45:01.180
Like I said a minute ago, the answer is yes to all three of these questions if the convergence is uniform.

00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:09.820
And what these three examples are supposed to show you is the answer is no if I only assume point wise convergence, the weaker notion of convergence.

00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:11.760
Okay.

00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:23.440
Okay. So, let's now prove some theorems.

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:31.900
So, this first theorem addresses question one.

00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:39.440
Suppose f in from s to r.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:49.720
F from s to r. F in is continuous, meaning it's continuous at every point in s.

00:45:49.720 --> 00:46:10.160
For all n and f in converges to f uniformly on s.

00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:18.840
Then the conclusion is that f is continuous.

00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:20.800
Okay.

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:20.860
Okay.

00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:29.580
All right. So, the proof.

00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:42.540
I mean, we've done several proofs of like this before, but for some reason, and at least I see in textbooks, for this proof, they always refer to it as an epsilon over three argument.

00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:46.000
And then it's the last time they call it an epsilon over three argument.

00:46:50.240 --> 00:47:01.560
So, we have to show f is continuous at every point in s. So, let c be a point in s. Let epsilon be positive.

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:09.960
We have to find a delta so that for all x minus c less than delta, an absolute value, f of x minus f of c is less than epsilon.

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:22.100
And what we're going to do is we're basically going to replace f by some fm for m large enough, and the fact that we have uniform convergence is what allows us to do that.

00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:25.040
So, let epsilon be positive.

00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:37.340
Since the fn is converged to f uniformly, there exists a natural number m.

00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:55.840
So, that for all n bigger than or equal to m for all y and s, fm of y minus f of y is less than epsilon over three.

00:47:58.120 --> 00:47:58.640
Okay.

00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:16.140
Okay. Now, this f sub capital m, I'm just going to fix it, so it should be n.

00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:25.760
But now, I mean, so this is for all n bigger than or equal to capital m. I really just need one. So, let's look at f sub capital m. That's a continuous function.

00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:51.480
Since f sub capital m is continuous, there exists a delta positive, so that for all x minus, if x is within distance delta to c.

00:48:56.140 --> 00:49:06.880
So, then I get that f sub m of x minus f sub m of c is less than epsilon over three.

00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:26.600
So, then this delta here, so I have been, okay, so I'm doing something what, you know, I stopped doing something which I was doing in all previous lectures when I would say there exists a delta not, choose delta to be this delta not, there exists a m zero, choose m to be this m zero.

00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:36.980
Now, you know, I'm actually saying, I've dropped that and stopped doing that because it should be clear from the context now what I'm choosing delta to be.

00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:55.840
So, then for all x minus c less than delta, so I'm saying that I'm now choosing this delta that came from here which came from f sub capital m. Capital m came from this what I needed here.

00:49:57.940 --> 00:50:24.900
So, now if I look at f of x minus f of c, which I want to show is less than epsilon. Now, if I add and subtract f sub m of x and f sub m of c and use the triangle inequality, this is less than or equal to f of x minus f sub m of x plus f sub m of x minus f sub m of c.

00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:41.540
So, f of c plus f sub m of c minus f of c. Okay, so I just added and subtracted f sub m of x and f of m of c and then use the triangle inequality.

00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:59.540
Now, by this estimate here, since I'm looking at a particular n basically equal to m, I have this is less than epsilon over 3 no matter what y is in this set.

00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:13.240
So, then certainly for x, I will have this is less than epsilon over 3. How I chose delta remember was to guarantee that this would be less than epsilon over 3 as long as x minus c is less than delta.

00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:22.400
And then of course, this one is less than epsilon over 3 again because of this uniform closeness of f m to f.

00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:37.440
And therefore, for all absolute value of x minus c less than delta, I have f of x minus f of c is less than epsilon. And that finishes the proof.

00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:54.960
So, if we have uniform convergence, then the uniform, so you know, a good theorem should be able to be stated in one sentence and what this or at least some sort of simple to an easy way to remember it.

00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:59.140
But this says is the uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous.

00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:08.100
So, the uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous.

00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:20.900
Next, we'll show in a sense the uniform limit of differential functions is continuous.

00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:35.380
So, this, we're going to do kind of a simplest statement of that although one can make stronger statements.

00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:41.800
But in practice, this one suffices really.

00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:50.980
So, I'm going to do a little bit of this.

00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:52.780
I'm going to do a little bit of this.

00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:54.140
I'm going to do a little bit of this.

00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:01.180
So, let's see what would be the short way of saying that.

00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:10.260
The integral of the uniform limit is the limit of the integrals.

00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:20.320
Something like that. That would be the short and sweet way of stating the following theorem which is, so this is answered at three.

00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:21.880
So, we skipped over two for a minute.

00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:35.880
So, let's see what we can do.

00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:40.060
Let's see what we can do.

00:53:40.060 --> 00:53:40.360
So, let's see what we can do.

00:53:40.360 --> 00:54:07.820
We can do a little bit of this.

00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:17.760
It is a continuous function. So, we can ask about the relationship between the integral of f and the limit of the integrals of f in.

00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:33.140
Then, the limit as n goes to infinity, integral from a to b of f in equals the integral from a b to f.

00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:39.020
So, the integral of the uniform limit is the limit of the integrals.

00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:53.560
So, this is just a sequence of numbers and we want to show it converges to this number here.

00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:56.680
So, let's do this the old fashioned way.

00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:08.860
The epsilon be positive since f in converges to f uniformly.

00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:23.120
There exists a natural number m such that we are all in bigger than or equal to m.

00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:25.920
We are all x and a b.

00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:33.180
f in of x minus f of x is less than epsilon.

00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:40.320
Now, basically, what we are going to do is integrate this inequality.

00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:44.860
Remember, integration, unlike differentiation, integration respects inequalities.

00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:58.260
For all n, bigger than or equal to m, meaning I am choosing m as this guy for this proving this limit.

00:55:59.060 --> 00:56:18.400
If I look at the integral from a b of f in minus the integral of a b to f, this is by linearity of the integral of f in minus f, absolute value, by the triangle inequality for integrals which we proved.

00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:23.680
This is less than or equal to the integral from a b of f in minus f.

00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:28.780
And what do we know for all n bigger than or equal to m?

00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:36.680
This function here, f in of x minus f of x in absolute value, is bounded by epsilon.

00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:42.440
Therefore, the integral of this side is going to be less than the integral of the right side.

00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:46.580
I did this wrong. Let's put a b minus a over this.

00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:54.560
So this is less than the integral a b epsilon over b minus a.

00:56:55.780 --> 00:57:05.000
And so then I just pick up this number times the length of the interval, which equals epsilon.

00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:14.420
So for all n bigger than or equal to m, the absolute value of this integral of f of f sub n minus the integral of f is less than epsilon.

00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:22.580
So the integral of the uniform limit is the limit of the integrals.

00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:32.340
So now we'll use this to do the last interchange of limits, theorem that I had in mind.

00:57:32.660 --> 00:57:35.560
So number two.

00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:46.300
So, and again, this is kind of the simplest statement and maybe easiest to prove that one can make stronger statements and prove them.

00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:48.440
But in most cases, this suffices.

00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:54.840
So, suppose f in a b to r.

00:57:54.840 --> 00:58:10.260
So this is continuously differentiable.

00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:12.180
So, we'll call n.

00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:18.540
F and g, these are two functions from a b to r.

00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:29.140
And f in converges to f uniformly on a b.

00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:35.760
And the derivatives converge uniformly to this function g.

00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:43.000
Okay.

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.400
And in fact, I don't even need this.

00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:50.340
You could just say point wise.

00:58:54.120 --> 00:59:02.000
So, only need uniform convergence of the derivatives if I'm assuming everything is continuously differentiable.

00:59:02.420 --> 00:59:05.460
If I'm assuming the sequences are continuously differentiable.

00:59:05.460 --> 00:59:14.740
Then f is differentiable.

00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:17.600
In fact, continuously differentiable.

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.600
Meaning the derivative is continuous.

00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:33.500
And the derivative of f is equal to g.

00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:42.120
Meaning that the uniform limit of the derivatives converges to the derivative of f.

00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:44.300
Okay.

00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:53.800
So, again, what this says is the uniform limit of, or at least in essence, in spirit is not exactly what it says,

00:59:53.820 --> 00:59:59.960
but it says the uniform limit of continuously differentiable functions is differentiable.

01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:01.560
Okay.

01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:07.460
And at the derivative of the uniform limit is the limit of,

01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:13.940
is, so, the derivative of the uniform limit is the uniform limit of the derivatives.

01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:15.160
Okay.

01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:22.600
So, to prove this, we use the fundamental theorem of calculus.

01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:30.740
So, let x be a point in a b.

01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:45.320
And by the fundamental theorem of calculus, if I want f in of x, by not want, but take f in of x minus f in of a,

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:50.420
this is equal to the integral from a to x of f in prime.

01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:54.800
Right. The integral of the derivative gives me back the function evaluated at the end points.

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:12.020
And therefore, since I know point-wise convergence, these two numbers converge point-wise to f of x and f of a, respectively.

01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:20.500
So, f of x minus f of a equals the limit as n goes to infinity of f of n of x minus f in of a.

01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:35.100
And this is equal to, just by the previous expression, the limit as n goes to infinity of the integral from a to x of f prime.

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:38.520
Now, f in prime, sorry.

01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:45.460
Now, these f in primes are converging to g, this function g uniformly.

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:49.340
And therefore, the integrals converge. Right. That's what we just proved.

01:01:51.720 --> 01:02:01.020
So, this equals the integral of the limit. And therefore, so we started off with f of x minus f of a.

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:04.120
And we showed it's equal to the integral from a to x of g.

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:12.180
So, f of x equals f of a plus the integral from a to x of g.

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:23.980
But now, again, by the fundamental theorem of calculus, this implies that f is differentiable.

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:32.940
And the derivative of f of x, the derivative of f is equal to the derivative.

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:39.520
So, remember, f of a, that's just the constant equals the derivative of this function, which is g.

01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:41.760
Okay.

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:55.460
I think we have just enough time to prove one more.

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:01.720
Pretty good theorem.

01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:08.280
Pretty good. It's very good.

01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:27.520
And, you know, it was, and then we'll use it in our next lecture to discuss, you know, or at least conclude some answers that we originally asked about power series.

01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:35.080
So, this theorem is due to the godfather, Vierstras.

01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:40.900
I don't know. Did I refer to him as a godfather or Riemann as a godfather?

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:44.240
Anyways, I think it was Vierstras that I refer to as godfather.

01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:47.100
Proof the following theorem.

01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:58.840
You know, when can you guarantee uniform convergence for at least series of functions, which are, you know, limits of partial sum, so limits of functions.

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:10.460
And you prove this, you know, basically so he could come up with a whole host of examples for continuous functions, which are nowhere differentiable.

01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:24.060
We kind of gave a proof of this theorem when we looked at that example, or we were talking about different ability, but we didn't state it as a theorem there.

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:50.660
So, let's take a sequence of functions, Fj from S to R, and suppose there exists a sequence, Mj, such that two things hold.

01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:52.960
So, these are a sequence of positive numbers.

01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:03.600
So, I don't know why I just erased that.

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:14.180
So, we have a sequence of functions from S to R, and a sequence of positive numbers, so that these numbers dominate the Fj's.

01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:31.580
So, and two, they're summable. So, sum from J equals 1 to infinity.

01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:40.920
So, is convergent.

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:59.320
And then the conclusion, and since I've been using numbers for conclusions and letters for hypotheses, let's go back to that.

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:05.820
Then we have two conclusions. The first one is pretty obvious for all X and S.

01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:25.440
This series, where I just take X and stick it into F's object, this converges absolutely.

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:44.380
And the second is, if I define now the function to be the sum of these series, then the partial sums converge to F uniformly.

01:06:44.380 --> 01:07:08.420
It converges to F uniformly as n goes to infinity on S.

01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:29.240
So, if I have a sequence of functions, bound to each one bounded by some number M sub J positive number, and, or, or, not negative number, at least, and the series involving the M sub J's are convergent, then the series of the F sub J's converges uniformly.

01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:50.920
That's a conclusion. So, in our example of that continuous, nowhere, differentiable functions, each of these F sub J's were cosine of 160 J X over 4 to the J.

01:07:52.360 --> 01:08:03.780
So, before we prove this theorem, we can combine all of the, what we've done so far to state the following.

01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:31.220
Now, function F of X equals sum from J equals 1 to infinity, and I can make it something else, but let's say sine of 40 K over 2 to the K X is continuous on, let's say, 0, 1 for now.

01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:56.160
Or, let's say, on R. Why is that? Each of these F sub, I'm really butchering this, trying to go fast, each of these functions, this is 2 to the J, not 2.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:15.520
Each of these functions is bounded by 1 over 2 to the J, and 1 over 2 to the J is sumable. So, then by this theorem, this convergence, so this function here, is the uniform limit of the partial sums.

01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:27.860
The partial sums are just, you know, a finite sum involving sine, so their continuous functions. So, F is the uniform limit of continuous functions, and is therefore continuous.

01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:40.280
So, we could have used this theorem to prove that function, we looked at back in different stability, it was continuous, but we didn't have uniform convergence and all that back then.

01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:56.060
So, we just proved it by hand, but, you know, using this, so this theorem, you know, gives you a big class of sequences of functions which converge uniformly to some function.

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:25.240
So, 1, so let's prove this quickly. So, 1 follows from, what is it following? It follows from the assumption A, B, in the comparison test.

01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:49.200
If I take an x and s, F sub J of x is bounded by M sub J, and M sub J is sumable, this series converges, so by the comparison test, the sum with absolute values here for each fixed x converges, and that's absolute convergence.

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:59.860
So, now let's show that the partial sums converge to the limit uniformly.

01:11:01.980 --> 01:11:27.760
So, let epsilon be positive since this sum converges, there exists an M natural number, so that remember we have this koshi criterion for

01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:34.320
n, I guess we don't have to have, so that what?

01:11:38.460 --> 01:12:04.300
Sum from n equals M plus 1, infinity of M sub J, so J, which is equal to, I chose a poor letter, so this is the same.

01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:23.160
So, this M here should not, let's change this to an n. So, this is less than epsilon, so the point is that the tail is small, the sum from J equals M plus 1 to infinity of M sub J is less than epsilon.

01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:52.720
Then for all n, bigger than or equal to this capital N, for all x and s, if I look at the limit, which is F of x, this is sum of the series minus sum from J equals 1 to N, this is equal to, now F of x is equal to the whole sum,

01:12:52.720 --> 01:13:14.820
so minus this first part, this is equal to sum from J equals N plus 1 to infinity of F sub J of x, and by the triangle inequality, which does hold for convergent series, this is less than or equal to sum from J equals N plus 1 to infinity of,

01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:44.800
F sub J of x, and by assumption A, this is less than or equal to sum from J equals N plus 1 to infinity of M sub J, and since N is bigger than or equal to,

01:13:44.800 --> 01:14:02.420
and I have this is less than or equal to sum from J equals capital N plus 1 to infinity of M sub J, and this thing, we chose capital N so that that's less than epsilon, and that's the end.

01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:14.020
So we chose, again, this N was chosen depending only on this series, it didn't depend on any x at any, you know, it didn't depend on the point x and s, all right?

01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:41.920
So I had to go through that kind of quickly because I'm up against the time crunch, but the point is for this theorem is that if I have a sequence of functions that are bounded by, you know, these numbers M sub J, so this is, I was going so fast I didn't even label it correctly, this is called the buyer's straws M test,

01:14:42.660 --> 01:14:58.480
because you see M here. If I have a sequence of functions bounded by some numbers M sub J, and those M sub J's are summable, then what it says is that the series of the functions converges uniformly.

01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:02.560
All right, so we'll stop there.
