00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.940
OK, let me just tell you first about the list of topics.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.460
So basically, the list of topics is simple.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.320
It's everything.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.920
So I mean, everything we've seen in class so far

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.600
is on the exam.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.800
But let me just remind you of the main topics that we've seen.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.920
So first of all, we learned about vectors, how to use them.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.000
And dot product.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.220
So at this point, you should probably

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.560
know that the dot product of two vectors

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.640
is obtained by summing products of components.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.400
And geometrically, it's the length of A times the length of B

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.440
times the cosine of the angle between them.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:37.580
And in particular, we can use dot product to measure angles

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.140
by solving for cosine theta in this equality.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.300
And most importantly, to detect whether two vectors are

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.400
perpendicular to each other.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.780
Two vectors are perpendicular when

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:56.880
their dot product is 0.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.440
Any questions about that?

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.860
Is everyone reasonably happy with dot product by now?

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.540
I see a stand silence.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.780
Nobody happy with dot product so far?

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:20.580
OK.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:26.260
OK.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.460
So if you want to look at, on practice 1A,

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.680
a good example of a typical problem with dot product

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.900
would be problem 1.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.620
And let's see.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.180
We are going to go over the practice exam

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.960
when I'm done writing this list of topics.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.860
I think probably we actually will skip this problem,

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.100
because I think most of you know how to do it.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.280
And if not, then you should run for help from me or from you,

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.040
a resident instructor to figure out how to do it.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.620
So the second topic that we saw was cross product.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.700
So when you have two vectors in space,

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.160
you can just form a cross product by computing

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:23.660
this determinant.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.860
So implicitly, we should also know about determinants.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.560
By that I mean two by two and three by three.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.180
Don't hover reading on larger ones,

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.540
even if you're interested.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.020
There won't be on the test.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.280
And applications of cross product

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.900
are not on the test.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.400
So for example, finding the area

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.660
of a triangle or a parallelogram in space.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.280
So if you have a triangle in space

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.980
with sides A and B,

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.340
then its area is one half of the length of a cross B.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.060
Because the length of a cross B

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.980
is length A, length B, sine theta,

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.840
which is the same as the area of a parallelogram

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:20.860
formed by these two vectors.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.600
And the other application of cross product

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.620
is to find a vector that's perpendicular to two given vectors.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.820
So in particular, to find the vector that's normal to a plane

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.520
and then find the equation of a plane.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.520
So another application is finding the normal vector

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.040
to a plane

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:05.080
and using that finding the equation of a plane.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.920
So basically, remember to find the equation of a plane,

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.680
A x plus B y plus C z equals D,

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.840
what you need is the normal vector to the plane.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.920
And the components of the normal vector

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.180
are exactly the coefficients that go into this.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:36.140
And we've seen an argument for why that happens to be the case.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.160
So to find a normal vector to a plane,

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.300
typically what we'll do is we'll take two vectors

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.060
that lie in the plane and we'll take the cross product

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.460
and the cross product will automatically be perpendicular to both of them.

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.220
So we are going to see an example of that

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.900
when we look at problem 5 on practice 1A.

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.500
I think we'll try to do that one.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.860
So another application, well, let me just mention it as a topic

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:17.980
that goes along with this one.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.000
So we've seen also about equations of lines

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:34.140
and how to find where a line intersects a plane.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.640
So just to refresh your memories,

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.360
the equation of a line, well, we'll be looking at parametric equations

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.480
to know the paradigm equation of a line,

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.340
we need to know a point on the line,

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.040
and we need to know a vector that's parallel to the line.

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:05.120
And if we know a point on the line and a vector along the line,

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.580
then we can express the parametric equations

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:13.840
for the motion of a point that's moving on the line,

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.400
moving, actually starting at this point, at time 0,

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:26.960
and moving with velocity V.

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.740
So to put things in symbolic form,

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.380
you'll get a position of that point by starting with a position

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:49.980
at time 0 and adding t times the vector V.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.080
So that gives you x, y, and z in terms of t.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.280
And that's how we represent lines.

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:04.200
Okay, so we'll look at problem 5 in a bit,

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:08.660
but any general questions about these topics?

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.040
No.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.100
Oh, do you have a question?

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.720
Do we have to know Taylor's series?

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.180
That's a good question.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.580
No, not on the exam.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:25.460
Okay.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:37.280
Okay, so Taylor's series is something you should be aware of,

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.300
generally speaking, it will be useful for you in real life,

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.820
at least if you do, you know, probably not when, you know,

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:43.900
not when you go to the supermarket,

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.300
but if you solve engineering problems, you will need Taylor's series.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.420
Okay, so it would be good not to forget them entirely,

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:55.360
but on the 18 or two exams, they probably won't be there.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:57.960
Okay.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.340
Let me continue with more topics.

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:06.300
And then we can see if you can think of other topics that

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.360
should or should not be on the exam.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:18.940
So third topic would be matrices linear systems,

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:24.820
inverting matrices.

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.920
So I know that most of you have calculators that can invert matrices,

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:40.220
but still you're expected at this point to know how to do it by hand.

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:45.500
If you've looked at the practice tests, both of them have a problem that asks you to invert a matrix,

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:46.800
or at least do part of that.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:52.540
And so it's very likely that tomorrow there will be a problem like that as well.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.720
Okay, in general, when a kind of problem is on both practice tests,

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.960
it's a good indication that it might be there also on the actual exam.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.920
Unfortunately, not with the same matrix, so you can't learn the answer by heart.

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:14.860
Okay, so another thing that we've learnt

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:21.440
about matrices, so I should say this is going to be problem-free

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:30.440
on the test and we're on the practice test, on the actual test too, I think, actually.

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:36.720
And anyway, so we'll come back to it later.

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:39.240
But so a couple of things that you should remember,

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:44.680
so if you have a system of the form AX equals B, then there's two cases.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:51.640
If a determinant of A is not zero, then that means you can compute the inverse matrix,

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:56.000
and you can just solve by taking A inverse times B.

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:02.540
And the other case is when the determinant of A is zero,

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:10.880
and then there's either no solution or there's infinitely many solutions.

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:21.200
And if, so in particular, if you know that there's a solution, for example,

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:24.700
if B is zero, there's always an obvious solution, AX equals zero,

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.800
then you will actually have infinitely many.

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:32.960
In general, we don't really know how to tell whether it's no solution or infinitely many.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Okay, questions about that?

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:47.780
Yes?

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:49.940
What do we have to look at?

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:55.520
Where do we have to know how to rotate vectors and so on?

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:03.640
Not in general, but you might still want to remember how to rotate a vector in the plane by 90 degrees,

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:07.320
because that's been useful when we've done problems about parametric equations,

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.260
which is what I'm coming to next.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:14.880
But so what we've seen about rotation matrices, that was a homework part B problem,

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:19.960
you're not supposed to remember by heart everything that was in part B of a homework.

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:24.240
Okay, it's a good idea to have some vague knowledge,

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:28.700
because it's useful culture, I would say, useful background for later on your lives.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:34.440
But no, I won't ask you by heart to know what is the formula for rotation matrix.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:44.560
Okay, and then we come to last but not least,

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:49.800
the problem of finding parametric equations.

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:04.840
And in particular, possibly by decomposing the position vector into a sum of simpler vectors.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:13.320
So you've seen quite an evil example of that on the last problem set with this picture of that.

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:17.600
Maybe by now you've had some nightmares about.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:25.680
Okay, so anyway, the one on the exam will certainly be easier than that.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:30.780
Okay, but as you've seen, whatever.

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:41.420
I mean, you should know basically how to analyze a motion that's being described to you

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:47.320
and express it in terms of vectors and then figure out what the parametric equation will be.

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:52.620
Now, again, it won't be as complicated on the exam as the one on the problem set.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.420
But there's a couple of those on the practice exams,

00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:00.020
and that gives you an idea of what's realistically expected of you.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:08.460
And now, once we have parametric equations for motion,

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:13.880
so that means when we know how to find the position vector as a function of a parameter,

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:19.980
maybe of time, then we've seen also about velocity and acceleration,

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:29.320
which are the vectors obtained by taking the first and second derivatives of the position vector.

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:43.040
And so one topic that I will add in there as well is somehow how to prove things about motions

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:46.380
by differentiating vectors identities.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:59.840
So, one example of that, for example, is when we try to look at Kepler's law in class last time,

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.020
we looked at Kepler's second law of planetary motion,

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:09.600
and we reduced it to a calculation about the derivative of the cross-product R cross V.

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:14.200
So now, on the exam, you don't need to know the details of Kepler's law,

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:18.140
but you need to be able to manipulate vector quantities a bit in the way that we did.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:28.340
And so, on practice exam 1A, you have actually an RG of problems on this topic,

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:33.060
because you have problems 2, 4, and 6, all about parametric motions.

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:40.140
Probably 2 more over will not be free-distinct problems about parametric motions.

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:44.140
But maybe a couple of them.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:49.840
Okay, so I think that's basically the list of topics.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.440
Anybody spot something that I've forgotten to put on the exam or questions about something that should or should not be there?

00:15:58.700 --> 00:15:59.240
Okay, you go first.

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:12.220
How about parametrizing weird trigonometric functions?

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.100
I'm not sure what you mean by that.

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:26.780
Well, so parametric curves will be, you know, you need to know how to parametrize motions,

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.960
and that involves a little bit of trigonometrics.

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:33.880
You know, when we've seen these problems about rotating wheels, say the cycloid, for example, and so on,

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:36.160
there's a bit of cosine and sine and so on.

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:38.780
I think not much more than that.

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.240
You won't need obscure trigonometric identities.

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:44.680
Okay, you're next.

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:50.420
Any proofs on the exam are just like problems.

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:54.440
Well, a problem can ask you to show things.

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:57.460
It's not going to be a complicated proof.

00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:59.420
Okay, if there's proofs, they're going to be fairly easy.

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:05.580
If you look at practice 1A, the last problem does have a little bit of proof.

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.820
You know, 6B says show that blah, blah, blah.

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:12.460
But as you will see, it's not a difficult kind of proof.

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:16.100
Okay, so I'm about the same.

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:17.400
Yes?

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:28.920
Are there equations of 3D shapes that we should know at this point?

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:33.060
So, well, we should know definitely a lot about equations of planes and lines.

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:42.040
And you should probably know that a sphere center that the origin is the set of points where, you know, distance to the center is equal to the radius of a sphere.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.140
We don't need more at this point.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:49.520
Okay, as the semester goes on, we'll start seeing cones and things like that.

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:57.380
But at this point, planes, lines, and, you know, maybe you need to know about circles and spheres, but nothing beyond that.

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:01.080
More questions?

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:03.480
Yes?

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:14.680
So, if there's a formula that you have proved in the homework, then yes, you can assume it on the test.

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:25.840
Maybe you want to write on your test that, you know, this is a formula you've seen in homework, just so that we know that you remember it from homework and not from, you know, looking over your neighbor's shoulder or whatever.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.840
But yes, it's okay to use things that you know generally speaking.

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:36.580
That being said, you know, for example, there's a, probably there will be a linear system to solve.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:41.100
It will say on the exam you're supposed to solve that using matrices, not by elimination.

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:50.800
Okay, so there's things like that, you know, if the exam, if the problem says, you know, solve by using vector methods or things like that, then try to use, you know, at least a vector somewhere.

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:55.460
But in general, you're allowed to use things that you know.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:58.600
Yes?

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:08.300
Will we need to go from parametric equations to x, y equations?

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:15.660
Well, let's say only if it's very easy, okay?

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:21.860
If I give you parametric curve, sine T, comma, sine T, then you should be able to observe that it's on the line y equals x.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:24.700
Not beyond that.

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:27.120
Okay.

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:28.920
Yes?

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:33.200
Do we have to use, sorry?

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:42.500
Yes. I don't know if you will have to use it, but certainly you should know about a little bit about the unit tension vector.

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:52.100
So just remember, the main thing to know is that the unit tension vector is velocity divided by speed.

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:59.380
I mean, there's not much more to it when you think about it.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:04.940
Yes?

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:15.020
Ah, Kepler's law. Well, you're allowed to use it if it helps you if you find a way to squeeze it in.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:22.000
You don't have to know Kepler's law in detail. You just have to know how to reproduce the general steps.

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:30.140
So if I tell you across this constant, you might be expected to know what to do with that.

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:35.680
But I would say, you don't need to know Kepler's law.

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:42.280
You need to know the kind of stuff that we saw when we derived it, such as how to take the derivative of a dot product or a cross product.

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:43.700
That's basically the answer.

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:55.880
Okay. I don't see any questions anymore. So you're raising your hand.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:02.400
Yes?

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.740
How to calculate the distance between two lines and distance between two planes?

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:10.440
Well, you've seen, probably recently, that it's quite painful to do in general.

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:13.800
And no, I don't think that will be on the exam by itself.

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:17.860
You need to know how to compute the distance between two points.

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:19.200
That certainly you need to know.

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:23.940
And also, maybe, you know, how to find the component of a vector in a certain direction.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:29.620
Okay. And that's about it, I would say.

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:31.740
I mean, you know, the more you know about things, the better.

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:38.060
But, you know, things that come up on top of these are the problem sets.

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:42.440
So, you know, the problem sets are interesting things, but they're usually not needed on the exams.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:53.400
Okay. If you have more questions than you're not raising your hand, high enough for me to see it.

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:59.780
Okay. So, let's try to go a bit over this practice exam 1a.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:04.760
Hopefully, everybody has it. If you don't have it, hopefully your neighbor has it.

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:08.620
If you don't have it, your neighbor doesn't have it, then please raise your hand.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:09.920
I have a couple of.

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.940
Okay. Okay.

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:53.460
So, oh, see, more people need it over there.

00:22:53.620 --> 00:23:01.080
Well, okay. I mean, if your neighbor has it, then just follow and then for now.

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.640
But, okay, I think there's a few people behind you over there.

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:08.280
Okay. I'll stop handing them out now. If you really need one, it's on the website.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.300
Or it will be here at the end of class.

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:16.060
Okay. So, let's see.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:26.840
Well. So, I think we are going to just skip problems 1 and 2,

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:30.680
because they are pretty straightforward and I hope that you know how to do them.

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:34.140
If, I mean, I don't know.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.880
Okay. Let's see. How many of you have no problem with problem 1?

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:43.840
Okay. Oh. How many of you have trouble with problem 1?

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:48.120
Okay. How many of you haven't raised your hands?

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:53.880
Okay. How many of you have trouble with problem 2?

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.340
Okay. So, I think, well, if you have questions about those, maybe you should just come see me at the end,

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:02.660
because that's probably more efficient that way.

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:06.000
So, I'm going to start right away with problem 3, actually.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.560
Okay. So, problem 3 says we have a matrix given to us.

00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:24.720
1, 3, 2, 2, 0, minus 1, 1, 1, 0.

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:31.080
And it tells us the determinant of A is 2 and A inverse equals something,

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:35.040
but we are missing two values, A and B, and we are supposed to find them.

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:42.920
Okay. So, that means we need to do the steps of the algorithm to find the inverse of A.

00:24:42.920 --> 00:25:00.940
Okay. So, we are told that the A inverse is 1 half of 1 minus 1,

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:07.980
minus 2, 5, 2, 2, minus 6, and here there's two unknown values.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:16.980
So, remember to invert a matrix, first we compute the minus, then we flip some signs to get the cofactors,

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:20.400
then we transpose, and finally we divide by the determinant.

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:26.720
Okay. So, let's try to be smart about this. Do we need to compute all 9 minus?

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:32.700
No. We only need to compute two of them, right? So, which minus do we need to compute?

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:42.000
Here and here, or here and here. Yeah, that looks better because remember we're going to transpose things,

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:48.280
so these two guys will end up here. Okay. So, I claim we should compute these two minors.

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:54.440
And we'll see if that's good enough. You know, if you start doing others and you find that they don't end up in the right place,

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:59.360
then just do more. But you don't need to spend your time computing all 9 of them.

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:05.460
You know, if you're wide about not doing it right, then of course you can maybe compute one or two more to double check your answers.

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:14.240
But let's just do those that we think are needed. So, the matrix of minus,

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:23.580
so the one that goes in the middle position is obtained by deleting this row and that column.

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:32.720
And we're left with a determinant of 3 to 1 0. 3 times 0 minus 1 times 2 should be minus 2.

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:43.460
Then the one for the lower left corner, we delete the last row and the first column.

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:52.580
We're left with 3 to 0 minus 1. 3 times minus 1 is negative 3 minus 0. We're still left with negative 3.

00:26:56.420 --> 00:27:02.320
Okay. Is that step clear for everyone? Good.

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:09.600
Then we need to go to co-factors. That means we need to change signs. Okay.

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:23.160
So the rule is, we change signs in basically these four places.

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:29.800
So that means we'll be left with positive 2 and negative 3.

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.000
Then we take the transpose.

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:47.060
That means, well, these two, so the first column will copy into the first row.

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:52.400
So this guy we still don't know, but here we'll have 2 and here we'll have minus 3.

00:27:54.100 --> 00:28:01.640
And finally, we have to divide by the determinant of a.

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:08.260
And here, well, we are actually told that determinant of a is 2.

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:12.440
So we'll divide by 2. But there's already a 1 half here. So actually it's done for us.

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:21.940
Okay. So the values that we'll put up there are going to be 2 and negative 3.

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:34.360
Now, let's see how we use that to solve a linear system.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.580
So if we have to solve a linear system, a x equals b.

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:50.080
So then, well, the matrix is invertible.

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:55.600
The determinant is not 0. So we can certainly write x equals a inverse b.

00:28:56.780 --> 00:29:02.000
So we have to multiply, oh, does that 1 half? 1, 2, negative 3,

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:12.180
minus 1, minus 2, 5, 2, 2, minus 6 times b is 1, negative 2, 1.

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:19.620
Well, so remember to do a matrix multiplication, you take the rows in here, the columns in here,

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:21.160
and you do dot products. Okay.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:26.840
So the first entry will be 1 times 1 plus 2 times minus 2 plus minus 3 times 1.

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:30.620
1 minus 4 minus 3 should be negative 6.

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:35.380
Except I still have, of course, a 1 half in front.

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:43.820
Then minus 1 plus 4 plus 5 should be 8.

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:50.440
2 minus 4 minus 6 should be negative 8.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:54.500
So that will simplify to minus 3 for minus 4.

00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.980
Any questions about that?

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:09.680
Okay. So now we come to part c, which is the harder part of this problem.

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:18.400
So it says, let's take this matrix a, and let's replace the 2 in the upper right corner by some other number c.

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:27.420
So that means we look at 1, 3, c to 0 minus 1, 1, 1, 0.

00:30:29.1000 --> 00:30:32.460
And, well, let's call that m.

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:39.220
And first asks you to find a value of c for which this matrix is not invertible.

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:40.740
Okay.

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:44.480
So m is not invertible.

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:52.900
Exactly when the determinant of m is 0.

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:54.440
So let's compute the determinant.

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:14.460
Well, we should do 1 times that smaller determinant, which is 0 minus negative 1 is 1 times 1.

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:21.800
Minus 3 times that determinant, which is 0 plus 1 is 1.

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:29.220
And then we have plus c times the lower left determinant, which is 2 times 1 minus 0 is 2.

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:35.780
Okay. So that gives us 1 minus 2 plus 2c.

00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:43.800
So I want minus 3 is negative 2 plus 2c that's 0 1 c equals 1.

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:48.600
Okay. So for c equals 1, this matrix is not invertible.

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:50.780
For other values, it is invertible.

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:58.120
Okay. So it goes on to say, well, let's look at this value of c.

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:00.720
And let's look at the system m x equals 0.

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:05.940
Okay. So I'm going to put that value 1 in there.

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:09.160
Okay.

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:23.280
Okay. So now if we look at m x equals 0, well, this has either no solution or infinitely many solutions.

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.240
But here there's an obvious solution.

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:28.640
Namely, x equals 0 is a solution.

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:32.380
Okay. Maybe let me rewrite it more geometrically.

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:49.260
That's x plus 3y plus z equals 0 to x minus z equals 0 and x plus y equals 0.

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:53.240
Okay. So you see we have an obvious solution, 0, 0, 0.

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:56.280
But we have more solutions. How do we find more solutions?

00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:02.120
Well, x, y, z is a solution if it's in all three of these planes.

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:05.460
That's a way to think about it.

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:15.300
So probably we're actually in this situation where in fact we have three planes

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:24.120
that are all passing for the origin and all parallel to a same line.

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:25.920
And so that would be the line of solutions.

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:31.780
So to find it, actually we can think of this as follows.

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:39.160
So the first observation is that actually in this situation we don't need all three equations.

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:45.460
Okay. The fact that the system has infinitely many solutions means that actually one of the equations is redundant.

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:53.420
So if you look at it for long enough, you see for example, if you multiply three times this equation

00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:56.560
and you subtract that one, then you will get the first equation.

00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:04.300
Three times x plus y minus 2x minus z will be x plus 3y plus z.

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:07.600
Now we don't actually need to see that to solve the problem.

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:11.640
I'm just showing you that's what happens when you have a matrix with determinant 0.

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:15.880
One of the equations somehow is, you know, a duplicate of the others.

00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:19.240
We don't actually need to figure out how exactly.

00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:28.140
But so what that means is really we want to solve, let's say start with two of the equations.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:47.200
So to find the solution, we can observe that the first equation says actually that x, y, z dot product with one three one equals zero.

00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:56.700
And the second equation says x, y, z dot product with two zero negative one is zero.

00:34:57.060 --> 00:35:05.520
And the third equation, if we really want to keep it, says we should be also having this.

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:15.000
Now these equations, now if we're done like this, they're just saying we want an x, y, z that's perpendicular to these vectors.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.120
So let's forget this one. And let's just look at these two.

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:26.780
They're saying we want a vector that's perpendicular to these two given vectors.

00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:29.920
How do we find that? We do the cross product.

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:49.480
So to find x, y, z perpendicular to one three one and two zero one two zero negative one, we take the cross product.

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:58.200
And that will give us something. Well, let me just give you the answer.

00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:02.240
I'm sure you know how to do cross products by now. I don't have the answer here.

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:03.380
So I guess I have to do it.

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:20.580
Okay. One three one two zero negative one that should be negative three minus one minus two probably positive three.

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:29.720
And then negative six. Okay, so that's a solution. And any multiple of that is a solution.

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:34.080
So if you like, you know, neatly simplified answers, you could say negative one one negative two.

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:37.940
If you like larger numbers, you can multiply that by a million. That's also a solution.

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:50.760
Okay. Any questions about that? Yes.

00:36:55.400 --> 00:37:01.020
That's correct. If you pick, you know, if you pick these two guys instead, you will get the same solution.

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:08.460
Well, up to a multiple could be that if you do the cross product of these two guys, you actually get something that's, you know, a multipolar.

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:18.200
Actually, I think if you do the cross product of the first and third one, you will get actually minus one one minus two, you know, the smaller one.

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:26.280
But it doesn't matter. I mean, it's really in the same direction. This is all because a plane has actually normal vectors of all sizes.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:40.160
Yes. I don't think so because see. Okay, so an important thing to remember about cross product is we compute the minus, but then we put a minus sign on the second component.

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:48.300
Okay, so the coefficient of J in here, the second component, you do one times minus one minus two times one. That's negative free indeed.

00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:53.980
But then you actually change that to a positive free. Yes.

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:16.160
So, do we have to do we have to.

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:17.700
So, I think that's a good thing.

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:27.820
Oh, by so solving by elimination. Well, if it says that you have to use vector methods, then you should use vector methods.

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:34.300
Okay. If it says you should use vectors and matrices, then you're expected to do it that way. Yes.

00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:47.340
So, it depends what the problem is asking. Okay, question is, is it enough to find the components of a vector or do we have to find the equation of a line?

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:54.020
Here it says find one solution using vector operations. So, we have found one solution.

00:38:54.020 --> 00:39:02.940
If you wanted to find the line, then it would be all the things that are proportional to this. So, it would be maybe minus free, free, free, minus 60.

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:05.440
All the multiples of that vector.

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:19.040
We do because zero zero zero is an obvious solution. Yeah. Okay. Yes. So, maybe I should. Okay, I'll write that on the board. You had another question.

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:26.040
So, the reason you took the bus by this is because you're not going to be able to find the answer.

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:34.520
Not quite. Okay, so let me explain first how we get all the solutions and how, why I did that cross product.

00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:37.520
I see that's a topic.

00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:21.120
Okay, so, first of all, why did I take that cross product again? So, I took that cross product because I looked at my free equations and I observed that my free equations can be reformulated in terms of these dot products.

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:28.320
Okay, saying that x, y, z is actually perpendicular to this guy and this guy's are the normal vectors to the planes.

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:33.120
Remember to be in all free planes, it needs to be perpendicular to the normal vectors.

00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:47.540
So, that's how we got here. And now, if we want something that's perpendicular to a bunch of given vectors, well, to be perpendicular to two vectors, an easy way to find one is to take that cross product.

00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:51.760
And if you take any two of them, you will get something that's the same up to scaling.

00:40:52.580 --> 00:41:07.900
So, now, what it means geometrically is that, well, we have our free planes and they're all parallel. They all actually contain the same line.

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:16.960
And we know that's actually really the case because they all pass for the origin. If you pass for the origin because the constant terms are just zero.

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:28.400
So, what happens is that the normal vectors to these planes, in fact, all perpendicular to that line.

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:42.160
Okay, the normal vectors are actually all, say, this line is vertical, the normal vectors are all going to be horizontal.

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:46.380
Well, it's kind of hard to do.

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:53.880
And so, by taking the cross product between two of the normal vectors, we found this direction.

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:57.240
So, now, to find actually all the solutions.

00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:13.480
So, what we know so far is that we have this direction, minus free, free, minus six, that is going to be parallel to the length of intersections.

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:19.780
So, let me draw it here, for example, in a free, free, minus six.

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:33.540
And so, now, we have one particular solution, zero, zero, zero.

00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:38.640
Actually, we have found another one too, which is minus free, free, minus six.

00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:58.160
But anyway, so now, the line of solutions has parametric equation, x equals minus free T, y equals free T, z equals negative 60.

00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:02.020
Or, you know, anything proportional to that.

00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:07.260
Okay, so that's how we would find all the solutions if we wanted them.

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.320
All right.

00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:22.940
It's almost time, so I think I need to jump ahead to other problems.

00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:29.000
So, let's see, problem four, I think problem four you can probably find for yourselves.

00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:32.860
It's a reasonably straightforward parametric equation's problem.

00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:39.320
You just have to find, you know, the coordinates of that point P, and for that, it's very simple trick.

00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:44.660
Problem five, find the area of a space triangle, sounds like a cross product.

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:48.220
Find the equation of a plane, also sounds like a cross product.

00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:55.120
Okay, and find the intersection of this plane with a line, means we find first the parity equation of a line,

00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:58.760
and then we plug that into the equation of a plane to get where they intersect.

00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:01.120
Okay, does that sound reasonable?

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:03.960
Okay, who's this parade about problem five?

00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:07.840
Okay, let me repeat problem five.

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:22.420
So, first part, we have to find the area of a triangle, and the way to do that is to just do one half of the length of a cross product between,

00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:31.780
you know, so if we have three points, P zero, P one, P two, then maybe we can form vectors, P zero, P one, and P zero, P two.

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:42.280
And if we take the cross product and take the length of that and divide by two, that will give us the area of a triangle.

00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:58.160
Okay, so here turns out that this guy is one one two, if I look at the solutions, so you will end up with square root of six over two.

00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:06.960
The second one is that thing you have for the equation of a plane.

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:12.900
Well, containing these three points.

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:22.240
Well, first of all, we know that the normal vector to the plane is going to be given by this cross product again.

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:39.960
Okay, so that means that the equation of a plane will be of a form x plus y plus two z equals something.

00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:45.460
Okay, just the coefficients here come from the normal vector.

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:51.800
And to find what goes on the right hand side, we just plug in any of the points.

00:45:52.020 --> 00:46:04.420
So if we plug in P zero, which is two, P zero is two, one, zero, then two plus one seems like it's free.

00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:09.120
And if you want to double check your answer, you can take P one and P two and check that you also get free.

00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:11.280
It's a good way to check your answer.

00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:31.380
And then the third part, so we have a line parallel to the vector V equals one, one, one, for over point s, which is minus one zero zero.

00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:34.040
That means you can find its parametric equation.

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:39.220
Okay, so x will be, starts at minus one, increases at rate one.

00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:42.160
Why starts at zero, increases at rate one.

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:45.020
Z starts at zero, increases at rate one.

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:47.780
You plug these into the plane equation.

00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:49.660
And that will tell you where they intersect.

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:52.380
Is that clear?

00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:53.460
Okay.

00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:55.240
Okay.

00:46:55.240 --> 00:47:00.580
And now in the last one minute, on that side I have one minute.

00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:04.320
Let me just say very quickly.

00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:10.000
Do you want to hear about problem six anyway very quickly?

00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:10.780


00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:11.100
Okay.

00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:17.380
So problem six.

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:21.300
So it's one of these like vector calculations.

00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:28.980
So it says we have a position vector r and it asks you how do we find the derivative of r dot r?

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:33.800
Well, remember we have the product rule for taking the derivative.

00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:34.420


00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:38.440
Uv prime is U prime V plus Uv prime also applies for dot product.

00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:45.580
So that's dr dt dot r plus r dot dr dt.

00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:48.040
And these are both the same thing.

00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:54.160
So you get two r dot dr dt, but dr dt is V.

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:55.620
That's the velocity vector.

00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:58.660
Okay. Hopefully you've seen things like that.

00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:04.780
Now it says show that if r has constant length, then r on V are perpendicular.

00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:12.660
So all you need to write basically is we assume r length r is constant.

00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:17.140
That's what it says. r has constant length.

00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:19.780
Well, how do we get to say something?

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:21.160
We probably want to reduce to that.

00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:26.860
Well, if r is constant in length, then r dot r is also constant.

00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:38.880
And so that means d by dt of r dot r is zero.

00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:40.640
That's what it means to be constant.

00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:45.640
And so that means r dot V is zero.

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:49.180
That means r is perpendicular to the.

00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:53.600
Okay. That's a proof.

00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:55.940
It's not very, it's not a scary proof.

00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:01.540
And then the last question of the exam says,

00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:07.140
let's continue to assume that r has constant length.

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:10.300
And let's try to find r dot a.

00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:14.560
So if there's acceleration, then probably we should bring it in somewhere.

00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:16.240
Maybe by taking a derivative of something.

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:17.320
Okay.

00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:21.420
So if we know that r dot V equals zero,

00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:23.720
let's take the derivative of that.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:24.760
That's still zero.

00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:39.340
But now using the product rule, well, dR dt is V dot V plus r dot dV dt is going to be zero.

00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:42.640
So that means that you're asked about r dot a,

00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:45.920
well, that's equal to minus V dot V.

00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:48.760
Okay. And that's it.
