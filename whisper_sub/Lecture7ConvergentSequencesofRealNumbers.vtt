WEBVTT

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:22.720
Okay. So, last time we were talking about sequences. And I introduced the notion of a limit

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:29.860
of a sequence. So we say that x n converges to x if for all epsilon positive there exists

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.800
an m, a natural number such that for all little n bigger than or equal to capital m, we

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:43.400
have x of n minus x is less than epsilon. So what this definition says is that given

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.280
any little bit of tolerance as long as I go far enough out in the sequence, the entries

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.600
are getting within that tolerance to x. Okay. And when we, when x n converges to x, we'll

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.900
write x is equal to the limit as n goes to infinity of x sub n or using this notation

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:12.320
x sub n arrow x. Okay. And so I said before that if you ever have a reasonably complicated

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.560
or interesting definition you should try to come up with examples and negate it. So,

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.040
the end of last time we saw a few examples of at least one example of a convergent sequence.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.600
Let's negate this definition because then we'll also come up with an example of a sequence

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:39.640
which is not converged. And so the negation of this definition is that x n

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:54.660
converges to x. What does this mean? So this is the actual negation part. If there exists

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.740
an epsilon positive. So whenever we negate a for all it becomes there exists and whenever

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.260
we negate there exists it becomes for all. So there exists some bad epsilon zero positive.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:24.620
Such that for all natural numbers n there exists an n bigger than or equal to m such that x

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:33.380
n minus x is bigger than or equal to this bad epsilon not in distance. Okay. So we have a

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.720
picture that goes along with convergence. We can have a picture that goes along with a

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:47.680
sequence not converging to x. So this means if I go out within this bad epsilon not and if I go

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:58.580
arbitrarily out in the sequence I can always find an element x of n which is not in that interval.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:28.560
Okay. And we use this negation to prove a certain sequence does not converge to x. But let's go

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.560
to the limit. So again how does the proof go? You have to verify the definition of the limit. I

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:42.600
mean there's nothing else that we have to use right now. So let epsilon be positive. And now

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:51.140
off to the side over here I'm going to do a little bit of work to show you how exactly in practice

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:58.200
one would find such a capital M or choose a capital M to get that 1 over n squared plus 30 n plus

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:06.460
1 would be less than epsilon for n bigger than or equal to capital M. So typically how this works

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:13.460
is unlike in calculus where you have some inequality that you want to get and then you solve for n.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:21.380
And analysis what's great is that you can replace that thing you want to make small by something

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:30.920
simpler and then solve that inequality. What do I mean? So I want what I want to do. I want to find

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:40.480
M so that if this bigger than or equal to M then so I'm saying the limit is zero so I want to show

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:51.880
1 over n squared plus 30 n plus 1 is less than epsilon. Okay. Now I could try to solve this

00:04:51.880 --> 00:05:01.080
inequality for n but this is a quadratic function and imagine I put 20 there so I can't exactly

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:10.080
solve exactly for n to guarantee this but what's great about analysis is that I just I don't have to

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:19.300
work that hard. I could start with this thing which I want to bound by epsilon replace it by

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.720
something bigger and then find capital M so that that bigger thing is less than epsilon. So what do

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:35.220
I mean? So let's start with this thing 1 over n squared plus 30 n plus 1. So this one is only

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:46.460
making things bigger. I'm going to do this very slowly. So this is less than or equal to this

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:54.800
because for this I've just added one to the denominator and 1 over n squared plus 30 n this

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.260
certainly looks a little bit simpler to solve for n less than epsilon but I can make it even simpler

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.880
by dropping the n squared because n squared is positive so that's only making the bottom bigger.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:12.700
Okay. So I have 1 over 30 n and this is certainly less than or equal to 1 over n.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:24.320
All right so what does this computation show? This shows that if 1 over n is less than epsilon

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:31.300
then this implies that 1 over n squared plus 30 n plus 1 is less than epsilon.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:38.940
Okay. All right if this thing is less than epsilon then by this string of inequalities this

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.940
thing will be less than epsilon. So we choose capital M so that we get this.

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.700
Okay. Now when we actually write the proof it'll look something like this but the you know

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:56.120
actual style of the proof is a little bit different and if you didn't see this it would just

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:02.280
seem like I pulled this capital M out of nowhere but this is the thinking that goes behind it.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.980
Let epsilon be positive. Now I'll tell you how to choose capital M.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.180
Choose M, a natural number.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:17.700
So that so we wanted for all n bigger than or equal to capital M 1 over n is less than epsilon.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:24.380
So this will certainly be true if n is bigger than or equal to M capital M so that 1 over

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:32.680
capital M is less than epsilon. And the reason we can choose capital M like this again

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:37.420
whereas it's coming from it's coming from the Archimedean property of the real numbers.

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:44.980
Okay so we've chosen capital M now we need to show that this capital M works

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:58.580
in for all n bigger than or equal to capital M. If I look at 1 over n squared plus 30 n plus

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:08.740
1 minus 0 my proposed limit this is equal to 1 over n squared plus 1 and this is less than or

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:18.880
equal to if I drop n squared and 1 30 n which is less than or equal to 1 over n which is less than or equal to 1 over capital M which is less than epsilon.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:21.280
Okay.

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:46.860
Okay so if something of a non-example let's show that the sequence minus 1 to the n

00:08:49.180 --> 00:09:03.040
dnc does not converge not democratic national committee does not converge so this is just a sequence minus 1 1 minus 1

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:18.860
and so on. Okay so we have to show it does not converge meaning for every x and r we'll show that x

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:23.540
proof so

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:48.040
let x be an r and what do we want to show minus 1 to the n does not converge

00:09:48.040 --> 00:10:02.620
okay to x okay and we'll use this definition so this definition means we need to find a bad epsilon not.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:18.020
Okay and here's the kind of thinking that goes along with this there's 1 there's minus 1 this sequence just keeps alternating right so so intuitively there's no one

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:32.560
in the way that every element of the sequence can be getting or every entry and the sequence can be getting close to some single x so what's the idea the idea is that the distance between these two guys is always 2.

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:47.700
Okay so somehow the distance between every entry or basically some entry has to be within distance.

00:10:47.700 --> 00:11:13.000
If it's if this is within distance 1 say to a given x then this will be greater than or equal to 1 in distance to x okay so you can imagine x is over here minus 1 is within distance 1 to x but then 1 would be greater than distance 1 to x okay so our bad epsilon not what's going to be 1 as we'll see.

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:28.320
Let epsilon not equals 1 that's our bad epsilon so now we have to show for all capital M and natural number there exists a little n bigger than or equal to capital M so that we have that inequality so.

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:57.900
Let M be a natural number then what do we see so then this says there exist an n greater than or equal to capital M and I will show that n is in fact either capital M or capital M plus 1

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:20.700
then 2 which is the distance between minus 1 to the m and minus 1 to the m plus 1 is less than or equal to now using the triangle inequality I add and subtract x and then use the triangle inequality.

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:50.560
So I have the sum of two numbers is bigger than or equal to 2 and the only way that can happen is if one of these numbers is bigger than or equal to 1 if both of these numbers are less than 1 then the sum is less than 2 and I would have 2 is less than 2 that's not possible so one of these numbers has to be bigger than or equal to 1

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:18.220
and therefore I could take n equal to capital M if this is bigger than or equal to 1 or if this is bigger than or equal to 1 I take a little n to be capital M plus 1.

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:20.740
So that's the end of that.

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:40.620
All right so that's good for examples for now. Let's prove a general theorem about convergent sequences namely that if I have a convergent sequence then it's bounded.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:18.480
And let me just give you a quick reminder of what being bounded means for a sequence i.e. exists some number such that fall in x n is less than or equal to capital B.

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:31.780
Now as beginning students of math what types of questions should we start asking ourselves.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:51.600
So one of the types or a type of question that we should ask when we come across a theorem that is a one way street meaning if something happens and something else happens it does the converse hold.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:58.020
So namely if I assume x sub n as a bounded sequence does this imply that x n is convergent.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:13.980
So if somebody ever hear the words does a converse hold that's what they mean. Now for this statement this is false. If x n is bounded implies x n is convergent that's false because we have an example right there of a bounded sequence.

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:25.160
This sequence here minus one to the end is bounded since I mean in absolute value this sequence one for all n so we could take B equals one.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:30.140
So minus one to the end is a bounded sequence which is not convergent so the converse is not hold.

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:41.700
So let's prove the theorem and let me draw a little picture to go along with it of kind of what's going on.

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:53.840
So here is zero let's imagine let me make this picture a little bit bigger before I go into the proof.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:08.920
So let x be the limit so this is not the proof yet this is just a more discussion.

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:28.140
So if this x sub n is converging to x then let's say I go out distance one to x then all of the x sub n's eventually have to land in this strip here.

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:53.320
So x sub n in bigger than or equal to some capital M. So I know that they're all within distance one to x so in absolute value they'd be bounded by let's say for this picture it'd be x plus one but if this was over there capital it would be the absolute value of x plus one.

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:59.760
So that takes care of all x sub n's within bigger than or equal to M and then there's only finite limit.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:21.480
Guys to deal with maybe there's a bigger one out here x of m minus one to deal with and that's how we define our number is by the absolute value of x plus one plus the absolute value of these finite limit.

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:25.360
So that's how many and then that would be something that's bigger than or equal to every element in the sequence.

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:38.760
So how does that's the picture that goes with it how do we write how do we take that picture to prove.

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:58.720
So, it's close x and converges to x that's our assumption and there exists a natural number m such that we're all in bigger than or equal to capital M.

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:13.320
x of n minus x is within distance one or x of n is within distance one to x then we're all in bigger than or equal to capital M.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:31.920
If we look at the absolute value of x sub n add and subtract x and now use the triangle inequality this is less than or equal to absolute value of x sub n minus x plus the absolute value of x equals one plus x.

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:43.080
So, for all entries in the sequence past this point capital M they're bounded in absolute value by one plus x that's just a number.

00:18:44.920 --> 00:19:00.540
So, then we just have to take care of the one up to capital M minus one guys we just have to find a number bigger than those guys in this number and we'll have found a B.

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:18.680
So, then let's take B to be x of 1 plus x of 2 plus x of capital M minus 1 plus this.

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:39.160
For all n and natural number the absolute value of x of n is less than or equal to B.

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:52.640
Because if n is less than capital M then it's absolute value is bounded by one of these it's absolute value is equal to one of these and therefore less than or equal to one of these plus some non negative numbers.

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:58.540
And if n is bigger than or equal to capital M then we have this bound that we use.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:06.760
And this number is certainly less than or equal to capital B again because it's this number plus a sum of non negative numbers.

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:31.140
Now, in general there's no like easy like easily checkable criterion for a sequence to converge.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.580
All we can do is verify the definition.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:50.120
But there are some sequences which are you can easily check or figure out if they converge just by telling if they're bounded those are what are called monotone sequences.

00:20:50.120 --> 00:21:02.740
So, this is in some sense the class of sequences that does kind of satisfy the converse of that theorem I stated a minute ago.

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:29.440
So, sequence x of n is monotone increasing if for all natural numbers little n.

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:34.020
And x of n is less than or equal to x of n plus one.

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:44.880
So, this means that x of one is less than or equal to x of two is less than or equal to x of three and so on.

00:21:54.220 --> 00:22:04.220
Sequences monotone decreasing if we have the other inequality.

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:06.520
So, things are getting smaller.

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:11.260
X of n is bigger than or equal to x of n plus one.

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:41.100
And if we have a sequence which is monotone increasing or monotone decreasing.

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:46.100
So, it's one or the other.

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:55.080
Say x n is monotone or monotonic.

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:11.080
So, it's simple enough to come up with examples of sequences which are monotone increasing monotone decreasing or neither.

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:21.700
So, one over n. So, this is just one, one half, third, fourth.

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:26.460
This is monotone decreasing.

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:35.800
And if I take minus this sequence then I get that reverse is basically all of the inequalities.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.820
And I get a monotone increasing one.

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:42.740
So, then this is minus one, minus a half, minus a third, minus a fourth.

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:46.420
Monotone increasing.

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:52.740
And then something that's not is we've already come across that minus one to the n.

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:57.040
And so.

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:15.920
And so, the theorem about monotone sequences is that there is a simpler criterion than the definition for determining when they're convergent or if you like.

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:19.160
They satisfy the converse of this theorem up here.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:44.180
So, monotonic sequence is convergent if and only if it is bounded.

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:47.880
So, we proved a minute ago that convergent sequences are bounded.

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.860
So, for monotonic sequences, converse holds.

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:55.640
So, let's do the proof of this.

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:59.820
I'm going to do the proof for monotone increasing sequences.

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:05.760
And as an exercise, I'll leave it to you to do the proof for monotone decreasing sequences.

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:19.200
So, suppose X of n is a monotone increasing sequence.

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:28.820
So, there's two directions to prove convergence if and only if bounded.

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:35.020
So, we have one direction meaning convergence implies bounded.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:44.420
This is just the previous theorem where we proved that every convergent sequence is bounded, not just monotonic sequences.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.480
So, the meat is in proving the converse direction.

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:54.580
And in fact, we'll be able to pick out what the limit is of this sequence.

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:08.600
So, suppose X of n is bounded.

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:26.980
Then if I look at the set of entries, so not the sequence, but if I look at the set of values that this sequence takes, so X of n is a natural number.

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:30.640
This is now a set, subset of the real numbers.

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:36.560
This is a bounded set.

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:50.860
Meaning it's bounded above and below.

00:26:50.860 --> 00:27:01.520
Because there exists some capital B so that X of n is an absolute value less than or equal to capital B for all n, so that means X of n is between B and minus B.

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:02.580
Okay?

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:09.880
So, let's picture again that goes with this.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:13.160
So, we have these X of n's.

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.880
X of 2, X of 3.

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:18.900
We know that they cannot go past a certain B.

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:27.040
And they're steadily increasing, but they can't keep strictly.

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:40.580
They can't increase without bound, so not only that, they're bounded by some number.

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:45.360
X, which I'll define to be the supremum of this set.

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:50.660
And these guys are just getting in essence, so this is a picture, let me know.

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:53.820
Let me try to explain to you what's going on.

00:27:53.820 --> 00:28:03.980
If X is the soup of this set of entries, then what do I know about X of n?

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:11.140
I mean X is that if I go a little bit to the left of X, so let me draw this again.

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:16.600
Okay, so let me back up a minute here.

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:26.360
So, since this set is bounded in R, it has a supremum in R.

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:37.600
And what I claim is that this supremum is in fact the limit of this sequence.

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:38.460
Okay?

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:40.500
This is a supremum of a set.

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:43.040
I'm saying it's the limit of the sequence.

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:45.780
So what's the thinking here?

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:56.000
So X is the supremum of all the entries in X of n, so nothing's ever going to be bigger than some tolerance X plus epsilon,

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.200
so we just need to worry about what's to the left of it.

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:06.700
And we need to find a capital number M so that all the X of n's are in this interval here.

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:07.560
Okay?

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:26.520
Because we're trying to show that the X of n's converge to X, the supremum of this guy.

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:30.880
So let's walk through this by this picture.

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:32.380
So X is the supremum.

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:38.560
Nothing's bigger than X, so all of the X of n's are to the left of X plus epsilon.

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:41.320
So now we just need to worry about X minus epsilon.

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:50.080
Now, since X is the supremum of this set, X minus epsilon can't be an upper bound for the set of entries of X of n.

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:58.180
So that means there has to exist some X of n so that it's bigger than X minus epsilon.

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:04.520
But now this is where we use the fact that this is a monotone increasing sequence.

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:14.580
Because then if n is bigger than or equal to capital M, then X of n is strictly to the right of X of m, or it's equal to X of n.

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:22.600
And still less than or equal to X because X is the supremum of all the entries.

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:27.560
So then for n bigger than or equal to capital M, they all have to lie in this interval.

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:32.040
And that's why the sequence converges to the supremum of this set.

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:39.000
So we're using in a crucial way the fact that this sequence is monotonic increasing.

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:43.760
So it proves this claim. Let epsilon be positive.

00:30:51.760 --> 00:31:08.700
Then since X minus epsilon is not an upper bound for this set X of n, there exists an M not natural number.

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:17.860
So that X of n minus epsilon is less than X of m not is less than or equal to X.

00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:24.780
And we'll choose M to be this M not.

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:37.980
Then for all n bigger than or equal to m, we have X of n minus epsilon, which is less than X of m not.

00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:45.940
And because n is bigger than or equal to capital M, and this is a monotone increasing sequence, X of m not is less than or equal to X of n.

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:59.140
And because X is the supremum of the set of all entries of the sequence, this is less than or equal to X, which is less than X plus epsilon.

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:03.980
Or to summarize so there should not be X of n. That should be X minus epsilon.

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:10.780
Or X minus epsilon is less than X of n is less than X plus epsilon.

00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:15.380
And that's the same as showing the absolute value of X of n minus X is less than X of n.

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:30.420
Now what's the change for monotone decreasing is that we'll be able to identify the limit of the sequence as being the imp, the infimum of this set.

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:34.380
But I'll leave that to you as an exercise.

00:32:57.140 --> 00:33:04.360
So let's use this real quick to prove the limit of a little bit more interesting sequence than the first one.

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:27.820
Now one over this one, which is reasonably interesting, I guess, but typically in math we just don't prove theorems for the sake of proving theorems.

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:34.360
Typically there's some concrete reason we do things.

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:42.160
There's some concrete sequence we're trying to prove converges or has a certain property or doesn't have a certain property.

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:52.880
And the basic one is, if you like, a geometric sequence.

00:33:52.880 --> 00:34:13.500
So if C is a positive number between 0 and 1, then we'll prove that this sequence, C to the n, is convergent and it converges to 0.

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:33.240
And we'll prove if C is bigger than 1, then the sequence C to the n is unbounded, in particular, can't converge.

00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:48.600
So let's go in reverse order, let's prove that if C is bigger than 1, then this thing is unbounded.

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:52.680
It doesn't require 1, but it's shorter than 1, and we can go ahead and do it.

00:34:53.140 --> 00:35:00.360
And we'll use this fact that we proved, I think in the first lecture or first or second lecture, using induction.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.540
So what does it mean to show something is unbounded?

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:08.320
Again, we get to use our negation skills.

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:28.320
It means that, so what do we want to show, for all B, bigger than or equal to 0, there exist an n, a natural number, so that C to the n is bigger than B.

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:45.480
Okay, now how are we going to find this n? This seems like a complicated thing.

00:35:50.220 --> 00:36:01.900
So let's replace it by something simpler. Again, this is analysis, which means we get to use our wits and try to replace complicated things by simpler things and work with the simpler things.

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:10.020
So let me do a little bit of, again, this is off to the side, kind of how would one thing through this?

00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:28.920
If you look at C to the n, remember we have this inequality from infinite time ago that 1, that as long as X is bigger than or equal to minus 1, then I get 1 plus X to the n is bigger than 1 plus n times X.

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:32.460
Okay, for all natural numbers n.

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:58.900
Okay, so that means C to the n, which is equal to 1 plus C minus 1 to the n, so this is my X is bigger than or equal to 1 plus n times C minus 1, which is bigger than or equal to n times C minus 1.

00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:06.180
You see? So if I want to make this big, it suffices to make this big.

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:10.180
Okay? So that's what I'll do.

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:24.820
So let n be a natural number such that n is bigger than b over C minus 1.

00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:27.700
Okay?

00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:39.700
Then now this we did off to the side, we'll just put in the proof now.

00:37:41.940 --> 00:38:01.920
And C to the n equals 1 plus 1 minus C to the n is bigger than or equal to 1 plus n times C minus 1, which is bigger than or equal to n times C minus 1, which is bigger than b over C minus 1 times C minus 1 equals b.

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:15.620
Okay? Okay, so now let's prove the first claim that if C is between 0 and 1, then the limit is n goes to infinity of C to the n equals 0.

00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:28.040
So first I want to prove the following claim that we in fact have a decreasing sequence, which is bounded below by 0.

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:45.900
So claim for all n, 0 is less than C to the n is less than, I should say, C to the n plus 1 is less than C to the n.

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:47.480
Okay?

00:38:53.300 --> 00:39:05.540
So the proof of this claim is a very simple induction argument. So we'll do this by induction. So we have the base case n equals 1.

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:22.880
So we are assuming that C is between 0 and 1. And if I multiply through by C, I conclude that 0 is less than C squared is less than C.

00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:32.800
And that's the n equals 1 case. And the inductive step is essentially the same proof.

00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:42.860
Suppose 0 is less than C to the n plus 1 is less than C to the n.

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:57.120
Then multiplying through by C, we get that 0 is less than C to the n plus 2 is less than C to the n plus 1, which is n equals n plus 1.

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:07.500
Okay? Here we're using this fact here. Okay? That C is positive so it doesn't flip the inequalities. So I can multiply through and preserve the inequalities.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:25.820
Okay? So this shows that this sequence is monotone decreasing and it's bounded below by 0. And in fact bounded because,

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:42.660
because, because, C to the n in absolute value, these are all positive. It's equal to C to the n. And,

00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:51.600
C to the n is less than C to the n minus 1, which is less than C to the n minus 2, so on and so on, which is less than C.

00:40:53.640 --> 00:41:04.300
So it's bounded. I guess I could have built that into this inequality and proved that as well, but that's okay.

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:27.220
So it has a limit. So by the previous theorem, as a limit, and I'll call it L. And now what I want to show is that L is 0.

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:48.780
And how we'll do that is one of these analysis tricks where, not really tricks, but rather than show that L is directly equal to 0, we'll show that the absolute value of L is less than epsilon for every epsilon positive.

00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:51.400
And therefore it has to be 0, because it's just a fixed number.

00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:03.180
So let epsilon be positive. Again, we're going to show that the absolute value of L, which is just a fixed number, is less than epsilon.

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:07.260
And therefore capital L has to be 0.

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:33.520
Then there exists, since this sequence converges, an m, a natural number, such that for all n bigger than or equal to capital m, C to the n minus L is less than 1 minus C times epsilon over 2.

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:49.220
Now, maybe you're wondering why I chose, why didn't I just use epsilon here? Well, in the end, it's just going to come out to this being less than epsilon and absolute value.

00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:55.420
Otherwise, I would have come out with less than epsilon times some number, and I did away with that number by choosing a different number here.

00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:09.500
So, now we compute that if I look at 1 minus C times the absolute value of L, this is equal to L minus C times L.

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:29.340
And this is less than or equal to L minus C to the capital m plus plus 1 plus C to the n plus 1 minus C to the L.

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:45.460
And by the triangle inequality, this is less than or equal to L minus C to the n plus 1 plus C to the n plus 1 minus C to the L, so I can pull out a C, which is positive, so I can get L.

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:55.820
Now, m plus 1 is bigger than m, so it satisfies this inequality, and so does this one.

00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:07.480
And therefore, this is less than epsilon over 2 times 1 minus C plus C times epsilon over 2 times 1 minus C.

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:20.660
And this is less than, so C is less than 1, so this whole thing is less than epsilon over 2 times 1 minus C plus another epsilon over 2, so I get epsilon over 2 times 1 minus C.

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:41.960
And thus, the absolute value of L is less than epsilon. And since epsilon was arbitrary, that implies the absolute value of L is equal to 0, i.e. L is equal to 0.

00:44:51.660 --> 00:45:11.460
So that's a very concrete application of some of these theorems we've been proving, which is really the only real reason one proves theorems is you typically have a concrete example of something in mind that you want to study.

00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:23.060
But in order to study it often requires some general machinery, i.e. theorems.

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:40.920
So now we'll talk a little bit about sequences obtained from other sequences.

00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:54.240
So these are called sub sequences obtained from a single sequence.

00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:59.040
So what do I mean by this? Let me give you the precise definition.

00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:23.180
So we start off with a sequence and an increasing sequence of integers in sub k.

00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:36.860
So let me just say what this means rather than write out the word and then say what it means.

00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:52.940
So this is the sequence of natural numbers, which are strictly increasing.

00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:15.260
So the index is not n, but the index is k.

00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:33.580
Subsequence of the original sequence, x sub n.

00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:40.580
So how should you view sub sequences of a sequence?

00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:49.600
You should think that I line up all the entries of x of my original sequence, x sub n.

00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:55.820
And then I just start picking entries out of this sequence.

00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:02.100
But every time I make a choice, I have to move to the right and make another choice.

00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:10.380
That's what I was just saying there expresses this condition that this sequence of natural numbers is increasing.

00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:12.860
So I pick an entry in the sequence.

00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:17.720
That's going to be my first guy, the first element of my new sub sequence.

00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:23.800
And then I move to the right and maybe I pick the next one, maybe I pick one three down.

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:29.140
I pick that one and then I move to the right of that one and pick a new one.

00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:32.300
And then I move to the right of that one and pick another one.

00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:37.380
So if you want to generate a sub sequence from an original sequence,

00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:40.320
how do you think about this?

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:43.080
Again, line them all up. Start picking entries.

00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:47.860
But every time you pick an entry, you have to move to the right and pick in order to pick your next entry.

00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:54.860
So let me give you some examples and non-examples.

00:48:55.980 --> 00:49:07.220
So for example, if our original sequence is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and so on,

00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:18.060
what would be examples of some sub sequences, the odd numbers, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and so on,

00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:21.300
you see how I'm taking the original sequence.

00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:27.620
So this is x sub n. I'm just picking entries from the original sequence.

00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:30.660
But every time I pick an entry, I move to the right and pick a new one.

00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:33.680
So pick one. Now I get to choose anything to the right of that.

00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:37.260
I pick three. Now I have to choose anything to the right of that.

00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:45.460
So in the language of this definition, the increasing sequence of integers is just the odd integers.

00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:51.820
So 2k minus 1. So here, x sub n is equal to just n.

00:49:56.460 --> 00:50:06.160
I could pick another sub sequence would be the sequence of even numbers, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.

00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:09.760
This is a sub sequence of this original sequence.

00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:13.620
Here, the increasing sequence of integers is 2k.

00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:30.420
I could pick the sub sequence could be the sequence of prime numbers, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13.

00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:39.560
And the increasing, yeah, so I don't have a general formula for that.

00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:49.120
Good luck finding one. But we'll just write this as kth prime number.

00:50:57.560 --> 00:51:02.420
Now what would not be an example? So these are examples of sub sequences.

00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:11.420
Not examples of sub sequences would be, for example, the sequence 1, 1, 1, 1.

00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:14.660
This is not a sub sequence of this original sequence.

00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:19.160
Remember, I have a sequence of natural numbers which is increasing.

00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:29.720
And x sub n sub k means that this new sequence is obtained from the old one by picking entries,

00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:35.020
by picking an entry, moving to the right, picking the next entry, moving to the right, and picking the next entry.

00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:42.480
Here, in order to get this sequence from this one, I just stay on the first entry and keep picking it.

00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:46.520
But that's not how a sub sequence is defined.

00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:53.760
So here, if you like, this would mean n sub k is equal to 1.

00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:59.480
This is not a strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers.

00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:09.320
Or 1, 1, 3, 3, 5, and so on. That's also not.

00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:20.540
So these are not sub sequences of the original sequence given here.

00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:28.380
So I hope that's clear.

00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:50.720
Now, I'm not saying, I want to emphasize this, I'm not saying that the number you pick each time has to be different from the number you picked before, meaning the value.

00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:59.100
You couldn't have 1, 1, 1, 1 as a sub sequence of this guy because 1 is only in the first entry.

00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:09.420
You can't keep picking 1 entry. You have to pick an entry and move to the next entry or 1 after that and pick that entry to obtain your sequence.

00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:16.960
But that doesn't necessarily mean that those actual numbers in those entries have to be different.

00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:39.160
So for example, if I look at the sequence, minus 1, 1, 1, 1, meaning x of n is equal to minus 1 to the n then a perfectly good sub sequence is given by minus 1, minus 1,

00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:44.980
minus 1, minus 1, where, OK, so it looks like I'm just picking one of the entries,

00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:45.840
but really I'm not.

00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:50.960
Here, the increasing sequence, so what I'm doing here to get this new sequence,

00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:55.040
I picked the first entry, then I picked the third, then I picked the fifth,

00:53:55.340 --> 00:54:00.260
then I picked the seventh, so n sub k equals 2k minus 1.

00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:05.140
All right, so all the actual numbers appearing in the sequence are the same,

00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:11.000
but I'm actually picking different entries from the original sequence,

00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:13.660
all right, where they appear.

00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:24.300
So this is also fine, so it's 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, and this is nk equals 2 times k.

00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:33.200
So these are all good sub sequences, so these were sub sequences of the original sequence.

00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:37.020
These are sub sequences of this sequence.

00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:14.460
All right, so from a given sequence, we obtain a new, we can obtain new sequences

00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:18.200
from this original sequence in this way.

00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:26.080
So a natural question is to ask, how does going from a sequence to a sub sequence,

00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:34.560
not react, but behave with respect to limits?

00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:40.880
If the original sequence converges to a limit, does a sub sequence, or does every sub sequence

00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:42.560
converge to that limit as well?

00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:49.760
And this shouldn't come as a surprise that it does, because all of the elements of the sequence

00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:53.400
are getting close, all the entries of the sequence are getting close to a given number.

00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:58.080
And a sub sequence is just, if you like, picking certain ones along the way.

00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:03.720
So certainly, if I'm in a sub sequence then, as long as I'm far enough out in the sub sequence,

00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:05.720
I'll be close to that limit as well.

00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:14.140
All right, so if you didn't get all that rambling, I'll go ahead and state the theorem and prove it.

00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:44.140
If xn is a sequence which converges to x, and x of n is of k,

00:56:44.140 --> 00:57:02.620
is a sub sequence of x of n, then the sub sequence converges to x as well.

00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:12.200
Limit as k goes to infinity of x of n sub k equals x.

00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:40.300
All right, so let me just start off by making a simple observation based on the fact that this increasing

00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:44.840
sequence, that the n sub k's are an increasing sequence of natural numbers.

00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:57.220
Since n sub 1 is bigger than or equal to 1 is less than n sub 2 is less than n sub 3.

00:57:58.100 --> 00:58:07.940
So on, this implies that we're all k, natural number, n sub k is bigger than or equal to k.

00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:09.360
All right?

00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:17.760
So this is not so hard to believe because n sub 1 has to be at least bigger than 1.

00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:23.140
n sub 2 has to be at least bigger than n sub 1, so it's either n sub 1 plus 1 or bigger.

00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:33.220
And therefore, you get by a simple induction argument, which I'll leave to you, you can prove that for all k, a natural number, n sub k is bigger than or equal to k.

00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:35.920
The induct on k.

00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:38.740
All right?

00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:44.480
So we want to prove that this sequence converges to x.

00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:47.360
And we're going to do that using the only means we have.

00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:53.340
So this is just some arbitrary sub sequence of x sub n. All we have is the definition to use.

00:58:55.900 --> 00:58:57.480
So we're going to now prove this.

00:58:57.700 --> 00:59:00.520
So we have to show for all epsilon positive, blah, blah, blah.

00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:04.000
So the first thing we have to do is let epsilon be positive.

00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:07.160
Now we'll use the fact that x sub n converges to x.

00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:12.360
sub x sub n converges to x.

00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:21.900
There exists a natural number, n, not, such that for all n, bigger than or equal to n, not.

00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:31.740
x sub n minus x.

00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:33.700
Absolute value is less than epsilon.

00:59:34.660 --> 00:59:37.860
Okay? This m sub not will choose for our sub sequence.

00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:42.980
Choose m to equal m sub not.

00:59:44.940 --> 00:59:51.880
So now we need to show that this capital m works for our sub sequence, meaning if k is bigger than or equal to capital m, then we have to show that this capital m works for our sub sequence.

00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:56.760
x sub n sub k minus x is an absolute value, less than epsilon.

00:59:57.220 --> 00:59:59.720
But this just follows from this fact, right?

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:14.880
So if k is bigger than or equal to m, this implies by this inequality, n sub k is bigger than or equal to m, which remember is equal to m sub not.

01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:16.540
So n sub k is some integer.

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:19.740
So natural number, bigger than or equal to m sub not.

01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:28.820
So that implies by this inequality that x sub n sub k minus x is an absolute value, is less than epsilon.

01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:31.500
Okay?
