00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.120
We'll continue our discussion of the Riemann integral.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:22.100
So let me just recall a few bits of notation from last time,

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.980
and then also the main result that we proved at the end of last

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:25.400
class.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.600
So we had partitions, which are just finite sets.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.700
So here is less than b, and we're looking at an interval a, b.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.040
Partitions, they're just finite sets of a, b.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:59.940
And then we also had tags, which were finite sets as well,

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:14.920
with c1 between x0 and x1, which is less than or equal to xc2,

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.840
which is less than or equal to x2, and so on.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:29.720
And we call these tag partitions.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.040
And we also had the norm of a partition.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.260
This is the max.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.200
So we think of partitions as breaking up the interval a, b,

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.580
up into smaller subintervals, x0 to x1.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.360
I'm going to give a different piece of chalk.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.460
This one is going psychodelecony.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.980
And then the xc1s are just points chosen in these smaller subintervals.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.520
The norm of a partition is the length of the largest subinterval.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:35.040
And then we had the Riemann sum associated to a partition tag partition,

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:45.040
xc, which is the sum from j equals 1 to n, f of xcj,

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.780
xj minus xj minus 1.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.460
So this is just some notation from last time.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.900
And then what did we prove?

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.840
Proved the following theorem, which is the existence for the Riemann integral,

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:16.560
which is the following that for all continuous functions on a, b,

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:26.440
there exists a unique number, which we denote, integral a, b, f,

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:37.500
with the property that, with the following property,

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.260
that if I take any sequence of tag partitions with norm going to 0,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.240
so this is the partitions are getting finer and finer.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:04:04.020
We're all sequence of tag partitions with norm going to 0.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:17.760
So we have that the associated Riemann sums, this sequence converges.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:29.260
So this is now a sequence of real numbers, and equals this number integral a, b, f.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.600
No matter what sequence of tag partitions I take with norm converging to 0,

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.100
the Riemann sums converge to this number, which we call the Riemann integral of f.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:48.620
And that, I think, the very last thing we proved was that the Riemann integral is linear.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:58.120
The integral of the sum is the sum of the integrals, and if I multiply a continuous function by a scalar,

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.180
then the scalar pulls out.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.340
So now we're going to discuss some properties of the Riemann integral.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:35.000
So the next is that, in some sense, the area of the union, if you like,

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:43.100
is the sum of the areas, if we think of the integral as being the area underneath the curve.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:53.260
So this next property is the additivity of the Riemann integral, which states the following.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:13.080
If f is in C, a, b, and I take a point between C and b, then the integral from a to b of f is equal to the integral from a to c.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:19.160
So, the integral of f plus the integral from c to b of f.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.040
Okay?

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.180
So, prove it again.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.920
All we know about these numbers is that they satisfy this property.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:42.000
So, what we'll do is we'll take a sequence of tag partitions of a c converging to this integral,

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:50.340
and a sequence of tag partitions from c to b converging to this integral when I stick them into the Riemann sums.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:07:00.000
But then when I take the union of those tag partitions, I get a partition of a b, and which will approach the integral of a b.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.480
That's the basic intuition.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:17.460
And of course, what was I saying a minute ago about the area of the union being some of the areas?

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:28.460
Well, again, like I said, if we think of the Riemann integral as being the area underneath the curve, then this says that the area from a to b,

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:34.240
underneath the curve is equal to the area underneath the curve from a to c plus the area underneath the curve from c to b.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:35.400


00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:38.580
Okay?

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:50.600
So, let's take, let's write notation here.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:08:06.940
Let's take two partitions, let's be a sequence of partitions.

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:29.220
So, a sequence of tag partitions, I should say, of a c such that norm of this partition goes to zero.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:41.700
So, this is a now partition of a c, and then we'll take another sequence of tag partitions of c b.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:09:01.920
And for those watching at home, wondering what these letters are, that's the Greek eta, that's the Greek zeta.

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:28.620
So, we have sequence of partitions of a c, these are the y and eta, and then we also have a sequence of partitions of c b such that the norm of these guys goes to zero as well as our ghost infinity.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:40.440
Okay? So, now if I have a partition of a c in a partition of c b, if I take their union, then I will get a partition of a b.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.460
This will be the union of these guys.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:15.540
So, it's easy to see that this is now a sequence of tag partitions of a b.

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:37.740
And moreover, so what is the norm of this new tag partition?

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:44.940
So, let's see what is the maximum length of these sub-intervals, well, it's just going to be the maximum of the norms of y and z.

00:10:44.940 --> 00:11:02.720
So, note that the norm of x, so bar, this is equal to the maximum of the norm of y,

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:18.320
and the norm of z are, and since both of these converges to zero, the maximum of them also converges to zero.

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:39.520
Okay? So, now we just put this all together. So, by this theorem, what do we know?

00:11:39.520 --> 00:12:06.180
Well, we know that the Riemann sum associated to this converges to the integral a b of f, the Riemann sum associated to this sequence of tag partitions converges to a c f.

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:19.700
And then this sequence of Riemann sums associated to these tag partitions converges to c b f.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:30.580
Okay? And now we just use the fact that taking a Riemann sum is, island is additive, right?

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:48.620
Okay? Since the Riemann sum associated to this partition, which is just a union of these partitions is equal to

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:19.660
this implies taking the limit as R goes to infinity, the left hand side as I wrote down here converges to a b f, and then the right hand side does some, the limit of the sum is the sum of the limits.

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:30.860
So, this converges to a c f, and then the right thing here converges to the second thing here converges to the integral from c to b f.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:45.900
Okay? And that's it. So, really, the fact that the integral is additive follows from the simple fact that kind of Riemann sums are additive.

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:57.480
Okay? And the fact that limits respect algebraic operations, the limit of the sum is the sum of the limits.

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:21.820
Okay? All right. So, the Riemann integral is additive. This is, and also linear.

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:40.260
So, we see that the Riemann integral is something that respects kind of algebraic operations with respect to the real numbers, namely adding and scalar multiplication.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:15:01.060
And it sort of respects, I guess, what you could say topological considerations, or not really topological, but this additive property is a very natural property.

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:12.140
So, what am I getting at here? So, now one could ask, how does the integral interact with any quality? So, this is something we ask about all limits, right?

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:21.100
Our least limits of sequences that we saw, you know, if one sequence lies below another one, taking limits respects that.

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:35.320
Okay? Of course, that's not true for the derivative. I can have two functions, one bigger than the other, and the second derivative in the derivative of the smaller one be bigger than the derivative of the first one.

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:54.140
But so, one can ask the question, let's suppose I have two functions, one smaller than the other. What is the relationship between the integrals?

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:20.680
Suppose F and G are now two continuous functions, one AB.

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:46.880
So, then the first part of the theorem is that if we're all x and AB, F of x is less than or equal to G of x, then integral from AB of F is less than or equal to the integral from AB of G.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:17:05.800
And this is kind of understandable. Again, if we think of the integral as being a theory of the area underneath the curve, if I have one function sitting above another function, then the area should be bigger than the area of the smaller one underneath the curve, which sits below the first one.

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:24.300
And now, the Riemann integral is a limit of sums, in some sense, a limit of certain sums involving F, and what?

00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:39.120
So, we do have this relationship involving sums and absolute values with the triangle inequality, which says the absolute value of the sum is less than or equal to the sum of the absolute values.

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:58.140
And if you think of the integral as being essentially in a limit of sums, or if you like a continuous sum, then you should expect that the absolute value of the integral is less than or equal to the integral of the absolute value, and that's indeed what we have.

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:10.180
So, second is the absolute value of the integral from AB of F is less than or equal to the integral from AB of the absolute value of F.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:18.060
So, like this is the triangle inequality for integrals.

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:41.420
So, we'll prove one using again the main property we have about Riemann integrals, that they satisfy this property, and then we'll deduce two directly from number one.

00:18:52.900 --> 00:19:15.620
So, let's take a sequence of tag partitions with norms converging to zero, then for all R, if we take the Riemann sum,

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:24.840
and then we'll take the sum of the property with respect to F of this tag partition.

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:30.040
This is equal to j equals 1 to n. This is just the definition.

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:39.480
R here is just indexing the sequence of tag partitions.

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:44.240
I should say this doesn't have to end at some single number.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:49.560
In fact, I can't in common with all of these tag partitions.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:20:06.220
So, here in a var is just a number of partition points that we have in our partition X superscript R.

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:21.360
And since we're assuming F of X is less than or equal to g of X for all X and AB, this is less than or equal to sum from d equals 1 to n of R g of cj of R.

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:44.620
And what is this last thing? This last thing is just equal to the Riemann sum of g with respect to this tag partition X and Xc.

00:20:44.620 --> 00:21:13.800
So, we started off with the Riemann sum associated to F, and we showed that's less than or equal to just kind of summarizing here that this Riemann sum is less than or equal to this Riemann sum.

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:29.760
So, now if I take the limit as R goes to infinity, this on the left hand side approaches the integral from AB.

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:44.080
And since limits respect inequalities, I get this, which is what we wanted to prove.

00:21:51.880 --> 00:22:00.260
And from number two, I mean for number two, we get from number one, essentially quite quickly.

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:22.000
So, since plus or minus F is less than or equal to the absolute value of F, we get that plus or minus, so integral plus or minus F is less than or equal to integral from AB of the absolute value.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:50.960
Now, scalar multiplication we proved last time pulls out. So, that means plus or minus the integral of F is less than or equal to the integral of the absolute value of F, which is the same as, so for the minus sign, this tells me this inequality.

00:22:50.960 --> 00:23:14.220
And for the plus sign, I get that inequality, but that's equivalent to saying that the absolute value of the integral of F is less than or equal to the integral of the absolute value.

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:15.640
Okay?

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:38.200
Okay, and that's the proof of the theorem. Let me make a small remark here. So, and this will be an exercise on the homework to prove this is the following.

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:58.080
Well, we know that taking limits respects inequalities, but not necessarily strict inequalities. So, I can have two sequences, one strictly less than the other for all N, and then as N goes to infinity, their limits could in fact equal each other.

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:09.260
So, for example, if I take the first sequence to be zero, the second sequence to be one over N, one over N is always bigger than zero, yet they both converge to zero.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:27.180
So, taking limits does not respect strict inequality. However, in this setting, which is very nice, I mean, it's actually an extremely important.

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:44.540
The property of the integral is that this limiting process that we do to take integrals, in fact does, it's not just any old limiting process, it actually does respect strict inequality.

00:24:44.540 --> 00:25:04.920
So, what am I saying? Is that we can prove something a little bit stronger, and that's, which I'll say in its kind of reduced form here, if I take a continuous function, and it's positive.

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:20.000
Then, we already know that the integral of F is going to be non-negative by what we just proved, but in fact, the integral of F is positive.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:33.540
And again, so this is also kind of important from a psychological standpoint, if we're thinking of the integral as being a theory of the area underneath the curve.

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:41.300
So, what this states is that, and again, I'm not going to prove this, this will be on the assignment.

00:25:53.540 --> 00:26:02.280
Again, so this coincides with our intuition of what a theory of the area underneath the curve should be.

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:11.740
So, this says if a continuous function is positive, so like the picture I drew, then the integral, which we interpret again as the area underneath the curve, is positive.

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:19.580
So, that matches what our desire for this to be a theory of the area underneath the curve should be.

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:23.980
But, okay.

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:46.140
And so, you know, we have, if you like, I mean, we could approve this from, you know, basic considerations in what the definition of the integral is.

00:26:46.140 --> 00:27:03.900
But, we have the following theorem that, for all alpha and r, or I could just say the following.

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:17.620
Well, let me not state it this way.

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:30.000
Okay, so, okay.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.040
I'm going to give you a little off script here, but it's okay.

00:27:39.1000 --> 00:27:43.140
So, we actually haven't computed a single integral yet.

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:53.420
Really, it's tough to, with this definition, and a minute, you know, we'll prove the fundamental theorem of calculus and be able to do it very easily.

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:58.380
But, let me first prove at least, you know, the most basic integral.

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:05.840
So, integral from a, b of the function 1 equals b minus a.

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:05.840


00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:18.780
So, what's the proof?

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:24.740
Take a sequence of partitions with norms converging to zero, and we just look at the reman sum.

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:36.500
And for 1, this will be quite easy to compute what the reman sums are.

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:44.720
So, this is a sequence of partitions with norm converging to zero.

00:28:46.360 --> 00:29:00.140
Then, if I look at associated reman sums, this is equal to j equals 1, 2, n of r.

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:09.000
No matter what xc is, I just get 1, and then times the length of the interval, the sub-interval.

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:14.580
Now, this is a telescoping sum, right?

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:28.360
You know, meaning this is equal to x1 minus x0 plus x2 minus x1 plus up until xn minus xn minus 1.

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:37.280
So, all I pick up is not x1, but x0 and xn.

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:48.480
So, this is equal to xj of r, sorry, of r minus x0 of r.

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:51.320
And this is the last point in the partition.

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:53.120
This is the first point in the partition.

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:57.900
And as always, for partitions, the last point is b, the first point is a.

00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:01.960
So, this is equal to b minus a.

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:08.720
And now, this thing on the left-hand side is equal to b minus a.

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:25.840
So, this tells me that the interval, which is equal to this limit of reman sums, is equal to b minus a.

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:37.060
And then the assignment for this, I guess, when you see this last week, was to essentially compute the integral for the integral from a, b of x dx.

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.240
Okay.

00:30:49.060 --> 00:31:00.780
And so, we get from this theorem and this theorem following bound kind of for the area.

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:04.700
So, let me draw a picture so that this is not so surprising.

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:08.600
Let's say I have a function from a, b.

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:14.640
There's the function f.

00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:20.880
And so, that was supposed to go through this point.

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.220
So, let's make that a little bit.

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:31.060
Okay.

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:34.180
I suppose I don't need these parts, but.

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:37.940


00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:49.420
Let's say I have, so for a continuous function, it always achieves a minimum and maximum.

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:52.820
And at least for this picture, the minimum occurs here, the maximum occurs here.

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:59.840
Now, what's the comparison about areas from this picture?

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:08.660
Well, the area underneath the curve of f will be bigger than or equal to the area underneath the curve of the constant function,

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:11.560
equal to little m sub f.

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:15.180
And that's just b times a times m sub f.

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:23.400
Again, by intuition, but this is also seen from the theorem we just proved along with the linearity of the reman integral, which we've already proved.

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:33.400
And the integral of f, the area underneath this curve, is also less than or equal to the area underneath the curve where f achieves a maximum.

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:40.540
It's the 12th week of class, and I still haven't brought color chalk, so.

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:45.540
Hopefully that was clear enough without me having to color stuff in.

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:49.080
So, the theorem is the following.

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:58.700
If f, again, we're working with continuous functions because that's all we can integrate or are going to integrate in this section.

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:05.200
And I have these two numbers, the.

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:16.100
m of f x, which we know is, in fact, a min, meaning there exists a point in here.

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:19.780
So, in fact, I'm going to write min.

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:24.480
We know that by the min max theorem, that for every continuous function it achieves its minimum.

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:30.960
And max.

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:51.800
Then, as I was saying a minute ago, the area underneath the curve m, little m of f, which is this smaller square, is less than or equal to the area underneath the curve of f.

00:33:51.800 --> 00:34:16.520
So, little m of f times b minus a, the area underneath the minimum, is less than or equal to the area underneath the curve of f, which is less than or equal to the area underneath the curve of the taller line, capital m of f.

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:27.380
So, how do we prove this? Well, we just used these previous two theorems, right?

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:57.360
Since, little m of f is less than or equal to capital m of f. So, since little m of f is less than or equal to f of x, which is less than or equal to capital m of f for all x and a b, we can apply that theorem up there to get that the integral of b.

00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:04.140
So, this is just a little m of f. Again, this is just a fixed number, is less than or equal to the integral of from a b of f.

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:19.340
And now, again, these are just fixed numbers. So, by what we proved here that the integral from a to b of 1 is b minus a. And the fact that scalars pull out.

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:36.160
So, this number here can come out. And this is just m of f times the integral from a b of 1. So, this is little m of f times b minus a. And over here, this is capital m of f times b minus a.

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:39.220
Okay? Okay? And that's the proof.

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:58.540
So, now let me make a few comments about some conventions, really.

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:07.860
So, we've been talking about, at least I've been talking about you're not here, so we haven't been talking at all.

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:26.540
So, we've been talking about the integral from a b to f when a is less than b. But, I'm going to use, I'm just going to set down some kind of convention,

00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:45.480
or you could say this is really notation, that when I write down this symbol, integral a to a of f, this is really just another way of writing 0.

00:36:45.480 --> 00:37:11.100
And another is that if in fact b is less than a, then the integral from a b to f. So, remember, we've been talking about the integrals from over intervals, or where the number on the bottom is less than the number on the top.

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:34.240
So, whenever I write this symbol with the bigger number on the bottom and the smaller number on the top, you should read this as minus the integral of with this being, you know, the right in the right place, meaning this number here is less than this number here.

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:56.820
And so, one, again, these are really just notations, that if I write this, this is a fancy way of writing 0. When I write this, you should, this means minus the integral with the right numbers on top and bottom, meaning the smaller numbers on the bottom, the bigger numbers on the top.

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:24.880
And so, maybe you ask, so this is, so why, why do I define that to be 0? Well, if you like one is consistent with the fact that for all continuous functions,

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:34.560
if I take the integral from a to b with b bigger than a, and I take the limit as b goes to a, this equals 0.

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:41.760
And 2 is then consistent with number 1 and then additivity.

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:11.740
With additivity at number 1, because then by number 1, I get that the, so additivity will tell me that the integral from a to a of f is equal to the integral from a b to f plus the integral from b to f.

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:30.400
So, if the integral from a to a of f, here assuming b is less than a, and so if by 1, this is 0, then to be consistent with additivity, this would force the integral from a b to f to b minus the integral from b of f.

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:56.900
So, both of these conventions, if you like, are consistent with the properties of the Riemann integral, namely that the limit as b goes to a of the area underneath this curve, as the base gets smaller and smaller is 0.

00:39:56.900 --> 00:40:05.220
And then from, if I assume this, then additivity tells me that the integral from a b has to be minus the integral from b to a of f.

00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:05.940
Okay?

00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:05.940


00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:29.420
So, now we computed successfully one integral. And of course, when you took calculus, that was not all you could do.

00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:42.520
So, calculus is what it is because of the hero of the story, which is fundamental theorem of calculus, which is what we'll prove now.

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:52.960
So, theorem, so fundamental theorem of calculus, which states the following.

00:40:55.440 --> 00:41:07.060
So, the first statement is if I have a function, big f, so first off, let little f be continuous function.

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:32.160
So, the first statement is if, basically, had a compute, integrals, if capital F integral from a b to R, is differentiable everywhere on a b.

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:49.280
And f prime equals little f, then the integral from a b of little f equals f of b minus f of a.

00:41:49.280 --> 00:42:01.240
Okay? Another way of stating this is that the integral from a b of capital F prime is equal to f of b minus f of a.

00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:14.420
And then the second part, so the first part is about computing integrals. The second part is about solving differential equations, basically.

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:43.100
So, the function, g of x equals the integral from a to x of f. So, for each x and a b, so I stick it in as a.

00:42:43.100 --> 00:43:12.020
So, the upper limit on this integral, this function is differentiable on a b. And it satisfies the simplest differential equation, which is g prime equals f and g of a equals zero.

00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:27.020
Okay? So, this is a fundamental theorem of calculus, the first part, being about how do you compute integrals? The second, how do you compute solutions to a differential equation, namely?

00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:45.820
How do I find the solution to the problem, g prime equals little f, so little f is the given, I want to find a function g that satisfies g prime equals little f with initial condition capital g of a equals zero. That's given by this function here, where I take little f and I integrate it from a to x.

00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:56.440
Okay? So, that's how I interpret the fundamental theorem of calculus the first about solving integrals, the second about solving differential equations.

00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:20.380
Alright, so this is the hero of calculus, the Batman of the story. And I said at one point that the mean value theorem is the Alfred of this story, and therefore it should play a decisive role in proving.

00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:34.620
The theorem. Alright.

00:44:48.040 --> 00:45:01.080
So, we're going to connect these two things, so in order to even get at this guy, let's, we have to take a partition, a sequence of partitions converging with norm converging to zero.

00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:30.540
So, let's take a sequence of tag partitions, I keep forgetting to write tag and say the word tag, but you should hear that, even though I don't say it.

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:55.160
So, let's take a sequence of partitions, so this is actually completely correct.

00:45:55.660 --> 00:46:15.840
So, no tags yet, no points chosen in between with norm converging to zero. And then I'm going to choose a special tag for each r, so that in the limit I get this equality between the integral of f and capital F of b minus F, capital F of a.

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:39.360
Alright, so here comes Alfred by the mean value theorem, so on, so we have this sub interval x of j minus 1 and x of j.

00:46:41.420 --> 00:47:06.400
So, by the mean value theorem, there exists for each j, there exists a point in between these two guys, such that.

00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:23.080
By take f of x of j, r, minus F, so capital F, remember this is function that's differentiable and whose derivative gives me little f.

00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:44.960
This is equal to capital F prime of xc j of r times xj minus xj minus 1. And by assumption the derivative of capital F is equal to little f.

00:47:44.960 --> 00:48:01.020
So, I'm going to replace this F prime with little f. So now, these axes I will take as my tag, my sequence of tags.

00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:25.540
I'm going to start by this relation here. Then, what do we conclude? If I look at the remonsum for f associated to now,

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:50.900
this sequence of tags where now the axes are exactly these axes that satisfy this relation, this is equal to, as before, some from j equals 1 to r of f of xgc sub j.

00:48:54.280 --> 00:49:15.360
Now, by how these axes were chosen, remember they were chosen to satisfy this relation here, star by the mean value theorem. So, this is equal to the sum from j equals 1 to n sub r of f of x of j minus f of x of j minus 1.

00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:40.500
And again, this is a telescoping sum. And so, all I pick up is when j equals n sub n of r, the last point, and when j equals 0. So, this is equal to f of the last point minus f of the first point.

00:49:43.280 --> 00:50:02.540
Now, for partition, this is always b, and this is always a, so this is f of b minus f of a. So, every one of these remonsums for this sequence of tag partitions gives me f of b minus f of a.

00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:24.740
So, then I get, take the limit, and I get the integral. And therefore, the integral from a, b to f, which is, the limit as r goes to infinity of s of f equals, and we just computed this is always equal to f of b minus f of a.

00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:46.220
So, we took a sequence of, just a recap, we took a sequence of partitions with norms converging to 0, and we chose special tags using the mean value theorem.

00:50:46.220 --> 00:51:04.360
So, by the mean value theorem on each one of these sub intervals, capital F evaluated at the right and point minus f evaluated at the left end point is equal to f, which is the derivative of capital F evaluated at some point in between times the length of the interval.

00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:23.680
So, now if we take the remonsum associated to this sequence of tag partitions, where these exceeds are defined by this condition, then we can actually compute this remonsum, and it just gives me f of b minus f of a no matter what r is.

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:32.880
So, then when I take the limit as r goes to infinity, the left side goes to the integral, but it's always equal to capital F of b minus f of a.

00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:39.000
So, that proves number one.

00:51:53.300 --> 00:52:00.160
So, for number two, what do we want to show? We want to show this function.

00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:17.680
So, first off, it's by convention g of a, which is the integral from a to a of f, this is 0. So, I don't have to check the second condition, I just need to check that this function is differentiable, and the derivative of that function is little f.

00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:47.500
So, let's see b in a b. So, what do we want to show? We want to show the derivative of capital g is equal to little f. So, we would like to show that the limit as x goes to c of the integral from a to x of f minus integral from a to c.

00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:17.020
So, we're going to do this by the books, by the book, I guess. When I say it, so that's kind of a bad pun, I guess. I don't know, but meaning an epsilon delta proof for this limit.

00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:30.320
So, let epsilon be positive. The delta that we pick in the end depends on, and we'll use crucially the fact that f is continuous at c.

00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:51.740
So, since f is continuous at c, there exists a delta 0 positive such that what?

00:53:51.740 --> 00:54:06.340
t minus c less than delta 0 implies that f of t minus f of c is less than epsilon. Let's give ourselves a little room over 2.

00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:23.480
Choose delta to be this delta 0. Remember, we have to show for every epsilon, there exists a delta so that if x minus c is less than delta, then this minus this and absolute value is less than epsilon.

00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:32.360
I'm now saying choose delta to be this delta 0, where this delta 0 is ensuring this right here.

00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:48.200
As long as t minus e is less than delta 0. Now, because of sine conventions, we'll do two cases.

00:54:48.200 --> 00:55:03.620
So, not really, I'm just going to do one case. So, suppose that x is between c and c plus delta.

00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:18.980
So, we want to also show, we also need to be able to do the case that x is between c minus delta and c that would cover the whole range of absolute value of x minus c is less than delta, but bigger than 0.

00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:34.420
So, I'm just going to do this case. So, now we want to show that if x is in here, then this thing minus this thing in absolute value is less than epsilon.

00:55:37.240 --> 00:56:03.660
So, first off, I would like to note that if t is in this interval, c to x, then that tells me that, so the absolute value of t minus c, which is equal to t minus c, this is less than or equal to x minus c.

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:33.040
So, let me just draw a picture so that this is pretty clear. This length is delta. If I take any t in between, then this distance from t to c is also going to be less than delta.

00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:54.720
So, that's all I've written down. Thus, by now compute the difference quotient minus the proposed limit.

00:56:55.260 --> 00:57:12.720
So, I'm going to get 1 over x minus c times the integral minus the integral from a c of f minus f of c. This is the thing I want to show is less than epsilon.

00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:24.460
Now, by additivity, the integral from a to x, since x is, well, the integral from a to x of f is equal to the integral from a to c plus the integral from c to x.

00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:38.300
So, this is equal to 1 over x minus c integral from c to x of f minus f of c.

00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:58.480
Now, this is just a fixed number. And therefore, I'm going to do a little trick minus the integral from, so, in fact, let me do this.

00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:03.020
Let me throw in some integration variables so that this becomes clear.

00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:18.260
So, this is f of t dt minus the integral of f of t dt. I've been using the notation where I just don't write down the integration variable, but let me do that here.

00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:22.740
f of t dt minus f of c.

00:58:26.900 --> 00:58:41.040
Now, this is equal to minus f of c over x minus c integral from c to x of 1 dt.

00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:48.620
Because the integral from c to x of the constant 1 gives me x minus c that cancels with this guy.

00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:51.880
Now, f of c is just a number. It's just a fixed number.

00:58:52.260 --> 00:59:11.020
So, I can bring this inside the integral and then use the linearity of the integral to, in fact, rewrite all of this as 1 over the absolute value of x minus c integral from c to x of f of t minus c to x.

00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:16.240
f of c dt in absolute value.

00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:27.600
Now, 1 over x minus c, this is positive because x is bigger than c. So, I can pull this out just like that.

00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:41.660
Now, what do I know? For t in between this, between c and x, the absolute value of t minus c is less than delta, 0.

00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:54.520
So, by what I have here, as long as I'm in this interval c x, I'm going to have this inequality hold.

00:59:57.880 --> 01:00:08.860
So, before I do that, let me first apply the triangle inequality for integrals. This is less than or equal to the integral from c to x of f of t minus f of c.

01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:22.760
So, by the second thing that I've underlined for t in this interval c to x, this thing here is always less than epsilon over 2.

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:37.600
So, by what we know about integrals respecting inequalities, this is going to be less than or equal to 1 over integral x minus c integral c to x, epsilon over 2 dt.

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:48.020
And now, this is just equal to, so this is a number, it comes out. So, I get 1 integral from c to x of 1, so I get x minus c.

01:00:48.740 --> 01:01:01.800
So, times the integral of 1, so x minus c. And that cancels less than epsilon.

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:17.160
And so, this was for x between c and c plus delta. The argument for c between c and c minus delta is essentially the same, just with minor sign changes.

01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:46.540
So, similarly, c minus delta less than c implies that the integral from a to x of f minus integral a to c of f over x minus c minus f of c is less than epsilon.

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:53.720
So, we've done x between c minus delta and c, x between c and c plus delta.

01:01:53.720 --> 01:02:20.180
So, which implies that if, then, which is what we wanted to prove.

01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:46.800
Okay? Okay. So, we've concluded the proof of the Batman of the story. And this gives us not only a way of computing integrals, but useful way of

01:02:50.000 --> 01:03:07.720
computing. If you like shifting the burden or shifting the blame, whenever we do compute the integral of certain products, so what I'm talking about is the integration by parts, which I can't remember if I said it was first or second, I think it was second.

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:24.900
Okay. First, most useful thing from analysis is the triangle inequality, the second being integration by parts. And a close third being the koshi, koshi Schwartz inequality, which in conjunction with integration by parts is quite a

01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:45.320
lot. Most research current research papers are based on these two things, right? And using them in a very clever way. So, integration by parts is, suppose f and g are

01:03:48.540 --> 01:04:11.860
continuously differentiable. What that means is that the derivatives exist on a, b, and they're also continuous. So, if I, you hear me say continuously, differentiable in the future, that means that the function has a derivative that's continuous.

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:30.820
Then the integral from a, b of f prime times g. So, the one with the burden, because remember different ability is kind of a miracle. So, miracles always come with some sort of burden.

01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:45.060
This is equal to f of b times g of b minus f of a times g of a minus the integral from a to b. And now we shift that burden to g times g prime.

01:04:50.300 --> 01:05:04.420
Okay? So, let me put a parentheses around that so you can, let's do it this way, g prime f. All right? So, I can take that derivative and put it on g. And what's the proof? The proof is just the fundamental

01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:29.320
theorem of calculus and the product rule. Since the derivative of f times g is equal to f prime times g plus g prime times f, we get by the fundamental theorem of calculus, the integral from a, b of, let's say the right hand side.

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:58.800
So, this is f prime g plus g prime f is equal to the integral from a to b of f times g prime. So, by the fundamental theorem of calculus. And now the integral of the derivative is the function evaluated at the end point. So, that's f of b times g of b minus f of a times g of a.

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:24.280
Okay? So, that's integration by parts, which is a consequence of, you know, the product rule.

01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:46.780
The quotient rule is something, it's just really the product rule in disguise, kind of, so we don't get really anything new from there. But we also remember have the chain rule, which then results in the change of variables formula.

01:06:46.780 --> 01:07:10.140
So, theorem, let b from a, b to c, d, b, continuously differentiable.

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:38.880
So, this means the function is continuous and its derivative is also continuous with the property that the derivative is positive on a, b of a equals c, b of b equals d.

01:07:43.580 --> 01:08:07.660
So, you can think of phi as being a change of variables from c, d to a, b. Then the integral from c to d of f of u, d, u is equal to integral from a to b.

01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:33.100
So, this means the function is the function of a, b of a, b of a, f of phi of x, a prime of x, d x. So, maybe instead of change of variables, so this is change of variables, a, k, a, u substitution.

01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:48.900
Where you set u equal to phi of x, then d u is equal to phi prime of x, d x. And again, the proof of this just follows from the fundamental theorem of calculus and the chain rule.

01:08:55.360 --> 01:09:11.300
So, let f be a function from a, b to r such that f prime equals little f. We can always find one by the second part of the fundamental theorem of calculus.

01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:41.100
We can always solve that differential, this differential equation, up to a constant. Then, if I look at the function, f of phi of x, and I take its derivative with respect to x by the chain rule, this is equal to f prime of phi of x times phi prime of x, which equals f of phi of x, p prime of x.

01:09:43.560 --> 01:10:11.080
So, then when I integrate that, integral from a, b of phi of x, f of phi of x, p prime of x, d x, this is equal to the integral from a, b of f of phi of x, p prime of x, d x.

01:10:14.780 --> 01:10:24.680
Now, by part one of the fundamental theorem of calculus, this is equal to, the integral of the derivative is this thing evaluated at the end point.

01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:42.940
So, f of phi of b minus f of phi of a, this is equal to f of d minus f of c, because phi of b equals d, phi of c, phi of a equals c, and phi of b equals d.

01:10:42.940 --> 01:11:05.600
But, again, by the fundamental theorem of calculus, since capital F is, when you differentiate it, gives me little F, this is equal to the integral from c to d of f prime of u, which is equal to f of u, d u.

01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:10.700
Again, so we just applied the fundamental theorem of calculus really three times.

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:23.080
First to find a function whose derivative is little F, then we use the chain rule to conclude that the derivative of capital F of phi equals this thing, which is the thing we're integrating on the right-hand side.

01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:45.900
So, that when we integrate that, that's equal to the integral of a derivative, and therefore we just pick up the end points, f of d minus f of c. But, because capital F is equal to, is an any derivative of little F, meaning it's derivative is little F, it's also, this number here is also equal to this integral here, which is this guy.

01:11:47.620 --> 01:12:01.120
And so then we get the change of variables form. So, I think we'll stop there, and next time we'll do a quick application of the most second most useful thing on Earth, which is integration by parts.

01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:05.240
And then we'll move on to sequences of functions.
