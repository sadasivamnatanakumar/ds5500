00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:19.240
So let's continue our discussion of series.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.400
So last time we proved the comparison test at the end of last

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.860
time.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.000
So this was the comparison test.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:41.180
So which is a statement about series with non-negative terms,

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.400
with one being smaller than the other.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.680
And one of two things, or two things are true.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.340
If I have x in and y in, non-negative with y in bigger than or

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.060
equal to x in, then the conclusion is if the bigger series

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:08.520
converges, this implies that the smaller series converges.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.720
And the second statement is if the smaller series diverges,

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.820
then the larger series diverges.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.640
And we also proved not using the comparison test, but for

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:40.800
the p series that the series won, sum from n equals 1 to infinity of

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.520
1 over n to the p, this converges.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.580
I mean, we did use a comparison test for one direction, I guess.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.040
So 1 over n to the p converges if and only if p is bigger than 1.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.100
So this converging implied p has to be bigger than 1 by the

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.020
comparison test in what we know about the harmonic series 1 over n,

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.380
sum of 1 over n.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:14.620
OK, so typically in applications, you use these two theorems together to

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.380
say something about series that don't look so simple.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:32.660
So for example, if I look at the series 1 over n squared plus 20, 20 in,

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.120
n equals 1 to infinity.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.360
So one could ask, oh, does this converge diverge?

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.900
Well, this is a series with non-negative terms.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.940
And remember, I mean, the bigger thing has to converge to give you,

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.260
to imply that the smaller thing converges and if the smaller thing diverges,

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.020
then the bigger thing diverges.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.580
So don't get the inequalities mixed up.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:13.160
So I have 1 over n squared plus 20 in, this 20, 20 times n is just making

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.060
things bigger on the bottom and therefore smaller overall.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.300
So this is less than or equal to 1 over n squared.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:32.020
And since this converges, this implies by the comparison test that

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:39.580
sum from n equals 1 to infinity of 1 over n squared plus 20, 20 in,

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.000
also converges.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.360
Now, a mistake I'm sure we've all made at some point is mixing up the inequality

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.360
and not getting quite the right answer.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:06.520
So for example, it is also true that 1 over n squared plus 20, 20 in,

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:15.140
is certainly less than or equal to 1 over 20, 1 over 20, 20 times n,

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.540
which is also less than or equal to 1 over n.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:37.700
And so you're tempted to say since this diverges, implies the other series diverges.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:50.520
But this is not right, because the inequality is wrong.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.260
Remember, if you want to apply the comparison test, you either have to have a bigger

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.780
series which converges or a smaller series which diverges.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.780
Here we came up with a bigger series which diverges, which gives us no information at all.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.360
It's if we have a bigger series like 1 over n squared that we know converges,

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.800
then do we get information about the original series?

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:28.700
OK, so let's do another well-known test, or at least test you should remember from

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.740
calculus, so called ratio test.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:40.740
So what is the statement of this?

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:50.260
So suppose x n does not equal zero for all n.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:06:04.080
And this limit, l equals limit as n goes to infinity of x, z, n plus 1 over x, z, n,

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.380
and absolute value exists.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:29.000
This, then, if l is less than 1, this implies that the series x n converges absolutely.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:40.160
And if l is bigger than 1, then the series diverges.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.900
Now what about l equals 1?

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.840
There's no information for l equals 1.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.980
Meaning you could have a series so that this l equals 1.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.860
And you could have a series where it diverges, and you could also have a series where l equals

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.120
1 and the series converges.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:30.380
So for example, x n equals 1 over n, for example, or even worse, let's say 1, for all n.

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:47.280
But we know that the series 1 diverges, because the individual terms do not converge to zero.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:48.360
They're just 1 the whole time.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:49.540
OK?

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:56.140
But for x n equals, let's say, 1 over n squared.

00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:09.920
So the one we just saw a minute ago implies l, which is the limit as n goes to infinity of n plus 1 squared over n squared equals the limit.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:23.260
And as n goes to infinity dividing through 1 plus 1 over n squared, and this equals 1 plus 0 squared equals 1.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:24.520
OK?

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:41.300
So for this series, the root or the ratio gives this l is 1, and this series converges.

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:49.180
So again, for the case that l equals 1, we have no information.

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:54.120
We can't say anything based on the theorem gives us no information.

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:19.120
So all right, we're going to prove this theorem basically by, so we're not exactly going to use a comparison test, but we are still going to compare this series satisfying.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:25.920
One of these two assumptions to a series we know, which is namely the ratio test for number 1.

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:31.400
So first off, let's get number 2 out of the way.

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:45.200
So let's suppose l is bigger than 1.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:55.180
Let alpha be a number between 1 and l.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.060
Actually, we don't even need to do that.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:12.620
So here's 1.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:23.440
So since xn plus 1 over xn, absolute value, converges to l.

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:28.420
There exists an integer m0.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:43.480
So that's a natural number, so that for all n, bigger than or equal to m0, xn plus 1 over xn, absolute value is bigger than or equal to.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:56.140
So here you can write 1 as, this is equal to l plus minus l minus 1.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.740
So think of this as being epsilon in the definition of convergence.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:11.200
And so this is over here, l plus l minus 1.

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:22.740
So by the definition of convergence for all n sufficiently large, xn plus 1 over xn, an absolute value has to be in this interval, so it has to be bigger than or equal to 1.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:41.640
Which implies that for all n bigger than or equal to m0, xn plus 1 is bigger than or equal to xn.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:12:01.800
And so I could write this as saying that xn is less than or equal to xn plus 1 is less than or equal to xn plus 2.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:03.820
And so on.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:24.920
But this implies that these xn's cannot converge to 0 is end to infinity, because for all n bigger than or equal to m0, they're increasing.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:36.000
And the only way for an increasing sequence, which is not negative, to converge to 0 is for them all to be 0, and we're assuming they're not 0.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:36.760
OK.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.400
OK, so that proves 2.

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:48.940
Let's prove 1.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.360
So suppose l is now less than 1.

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:08.160
And now let alpha be a number between l and 1.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:14.060
So I just want to give myself a little bit of room to work, as you'll see in just a second.

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:32.020
So by the same reasoning as before, so here's l alpha 1 alpha I can write as l plus alpha minus l.

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:35.000
So I should think of this as kind of an epsilon.

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:56.400
Then since xn plus 1 over xn and absolute value converges to l, which is less than alpha, it exists in m0 natural number.

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:12.240
So that, well, n bigger than or equal to m0, xn plus 1 over xn and absolute value is less than or equal to alpha.

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:25.120
OK, so here I have alpha just a little bit bigger than l, and if I draw, so this is l minus alpha minus l.

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:38.960
So since I have this sequence here converging to l for all insufficiently large, this should be in this interval, meaning this should be less than or equal to alpha.

00:14:40.420 --> 00:15:04.620
OK, then for all n bigger than or equal to m0, so let me just write this slightly differently x sub n plus 1 is less than or equal to alpha times the absolute value of x sub n.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.260
Now, let's see what this means.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:24.760
For all n bigger than or equal to m sub 0, let's say I look at the absolute value of x sub n.

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:45.000
So now this n has nothing to do with these n, it's just that the absolute value of x sub n is less than or equal to x.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:52.000
So maybe I'm off by...

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:02.200
OK, so let's increase that by 1.

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.820
Well, OK, so let's not be confusing here.

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:15.240
Let's make this l. Let's make that l.

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:23.940
So for all l bigger than or equal to m0 plus 1, so think of l as playing the role of being in plus 1.

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:33.720
This is less than or equal to l x to the l minus 1, which is less than or equal to x to the l minus 2.

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:44.540
Now with a square, so what I have here is now alpha times alpha x to the l minus 2.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:57.280
And now let's drop again by 1.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:05.340
And I can do this as long as this quantity here is bigger than or equal to m.

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:09.500
So I get this is...

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:22.820
If I keep doing that, this is less than or equal to alpha to the l minus m0 next to the m0.

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:26.040
OK?

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:33.040
OK.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:36.360


00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:49.680
So let's shift the things.

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:56.680
Yeah.

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:07.380
OK, so...

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.560
All right.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:15.040
Now we're going to use this to bound the partial sums of the x of n.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:17.960
So...

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:23.180
It would be a natural number.

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:32.480
And if we look at partial sum, sum from n equals 1 to m of x of n,

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:52.580
this is equal to sum n equals 1 to m0 x n plus sum from n equals m0 plus 1 to m x sub.

00:18:53.320 --> 00:19:01.840
Now let me just change dummy variables for signing for the indexing this.

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:11.900
So this is equal to the sum from n equals 1 to m0 of x n.

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:18.360
And now this, I'm going to use this inequality here.

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:20.340
So...

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:21.420
OK, this is kind of a mess.

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:48.700
So this is the inequality that I get from this.

00:19:49.540 --> 00:20:00.640
Remember, alpha is less than 1 plus...

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:14.640
OK, so...

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:21.520
And so this is equal to m times l equals m0 plus 1 to m.

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:22.660
OK, everything's fine.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:29.640
Times alpha to the l minus m0 plus 1.

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:37.400
OK, so all I did here was replace this absolute value of x of the of x of l.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:43.180
L is just a dummy variable for indexing these guys using this inequality here.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:57.780
So sorry, I kind of messed that up a little bit, but the important thing is that we have this inequality which somehow tells you this series is not that far from being a geometric series,

00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:59.380
at least when l is big enough.

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:06.040
OK, so then when we take an arbitrary partial sums, we split it up into two parts.

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:18.500
The stuff that comes up to this integer m sub 0, which we don't care about, that's just a fixed number, plus this part that we care about, which is after this fixed number m0.

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:26.320
And we use this inequality to replace this by x sub m0 plus 1, alpha to the l minus m0 plus 1.

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:30.540
OK, the thing to remember is that little m is the thing that's changing.

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:35.220
OK, so we're trying to bound this independent of little m.

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:40.100
OK, capital m some 0, that's just something fixed, that could be a thousand.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:54.620
All right, so this is equal to sum from n equals 1 to m0 xn plus x sub m0 plus 1.

00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:04.440
And now if I change the variable again, so l starts at m0 plus 1 and ends at m.

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:08.740
So this is now a sum if I go.

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:16.820
So now for the second sum, n is equal to l minus m0 plus 1.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:29.740
So now n starts at 0 and ends at m minus m0 plus 1, alpha to the n.

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:34.800
OK, again, m is the thing that's changing here.

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:38.300
And we're trying to bound this independently of little m.

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:41.880
But now we're in good shape because this looks like a geometric series.

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:44.120
Alpha remember is less than 1.

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:57.740
So this is less than or equal to sum from n equals 1 to m0 x sub n plus x sub m0 plus 1 times.

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:09.460
Now instead of just being a sum from 0 up to m minus m0 plus 1, why not throw all of it in there.

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:26.380
And this is equal to n equals 0 xn plus x m0 plus 1 times 1 over 1 minus alpha.

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:29.800
Remember, alpha is a number that we fixed to be less than 1.

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:39.420
If you try to do what we did before and not kind of fix alpha just a little bit to the left of 1 and try to do everything with 1,

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:43.260
you would have wound up with 1 to the n here.

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.040
And that wouldn't have finished the proof.

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.100
That wouldn't have closed the proof.

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:50.840
But given yourself a little bit of room, which is why we fixed this alpha.

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:57.740
Now this number here is independent of little m.

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:04.960
That's the whole point.

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:34.940
So what have we proven that for all natural numbers, little m, the nth partial sum is less than or equal to a fixed number given by sum from n.

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:49.320
And therefore, this sequence of partial sums is bounded.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:25:00.200
And therefore converges.

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:32.580
So kind of the simplest application of this is maybe a series that looks familiar.

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:40.000
So for all x. So this is I guess a theorem slash example.

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:48.180
But for all x and r, the series x to the n over n factorial and equals 0 to infinity.

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:57.260
Converges absolutely here.

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:01.700
Zero factorial is of course one.

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:07.760
And you just use the ratio test.

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:08.020
That's right.

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:20.780
Of the x to the n plus 1 or the n plus first term over x to the n.

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:22.540
So absolute value.

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:39.960
And this equals the limit as n goes to infinity of n plus 1 factorial is equal to n plus 1 times n factorial.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:45.780
So this cancels with that n factorial and I get x over n plus 1.

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:51.800
Limit as n goes to infinity of just this fixed number over n plus 1 equals 0.

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.540
And this is certainly less than 1.

00:26:56.340 --> 00:27:00.980
And therefore by the ratio test, this series converges absolutely.

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:16.980
So you know, I got a little hung up on exactly the indexes and matching them up precisely.

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:27.500
But the important thing to take home from this proof was that when this ratio is less than 1,

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:40.960
then this series behaves very much like a geometric series for, as the terms get very, as you go far enough out in the terms.

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:51.540
And this idea of just trying to relate the series to a simple series that you know a lot about.

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:58.080
I mean, basically the only series that you know everything about, namely even how to sum it.

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:07.320
This is how you get this test. And this is also even simpler how you get the next test, which is the root test.

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:23.820
So it's a root test.

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:52.820
Let's take a series and suppose this L, this limit, L equals the limit as n goes to infinity of x sub n to the 1 over n exists.

00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:05.180
Then two conclusions just kind of just like in ratio tests.

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:21.820
If L is less than 1, then this implies that the series converges absolutely.

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:43.380
And if L is bigger than 1, then this series converges, no, the series diverges.

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:55.300
And again, just like in the ratio test, no information for L equals 1.

00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:06.400
You take the same series that we looked at before.

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:18.300
Let's see, did I leave it up there? Yes. So xn x of n equals 1 for all n. This limit here, L, exists.

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:30.080
It's equal to 1 and that series diverges. If you look at 1 over n squared and I take this limit, I again get 1, but that series converges.

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:35.000
So for L equals 1, we get no information.

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:57.640
So let's, and in this case, it's even clear how we're relating the series to a geometric series.

00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:09.080
So let's, in my notes, I proved two first both times. So perhaps I should have written it 1, 2.

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:17.960
I'll know for the future. So suppose L is bigger than 1.

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:24.900
Now we're going to show that this series diverges again by showing that the terms do not converge to 0.

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:41.220
So it's the same idea as before. Here's L, here's 1. So for all n sufficiently large, x to be n to the 1 over n has to be inside this interval.

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:54.220
And since x to the n, x sub n to the 1 over n converges to L, which is bigger than 1.

00:31:54.220 --> 00:32:21.880
So it implies there exists an engine to n 0 such that for all n bigger than or equal to n 0, x sub n to the 1 over n is bigger than 1, which implies, for all n bigger than or equal to n 0, x sub n in absolute value is bigger than by just taking in powers of both sides is bigger than 1.

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:33.560
Now since all of the absolute values of x sub n is bigger than 1, this implies that this cannot converge to 0.

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:47.580
So remember, I mean, let me remove this absolute value.

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:59.220
So x sub n cannot converge to 0. Why? I mean, we could go back to the basic definition of convergence of what it means for a sequence to converge to a real number x.

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:13.060
And what it doesn't mean, or what it means for it to not converge to x. So x n does not converge to 0 if there exists a bad epsilon so that x sub n is outside of that interval.

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:23.140
So x sub n is outside of that interval if I go far enough out.

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:48.240
And we certainly have that here. Or you could use this bigger than 1 in fact implies that the limb soup of x sub n is bigger than 1.

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:57.980
Because if I have two sequences, one bigger than the other, then the limb soup of the bigger one is bigger than or equal to the limb soup of the other one, which is 1.

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:17.380
And you're doing in this week's assignment that x n converges to 0 if and only if the limb soup of the absolute values of x n converges to 0.

00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:26.220
And this is not. It's bigger than or equal to 1. So we'll leave that there.

00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:46.220
Okay, so now for the other case that L is less than 1.

00:34:46.220 --> 00:35:00.080
Suppose L is less than 1, then let alpha be the number between L and 1.

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:13.300
Again, since this converges to L, which is less than alpha, for all n sufficiently large, this has to be less than alpha.

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:17.480
So there exists an integer.

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:45.060
I have x to the n to the 1 over n is less than alpha, which implies that for all n, bigger than or equal to m0, x to the n, an absolute value is less than alpha to the n.

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:59.460
Okay, so here again, we're seeing this series, if it satisfies these hypotheses, is very much acting like a geometric series. Remember, alpha is less than 1.

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:15.300
Then for every natural number, little m, if we look at the mth partial sum of the absolute value, say n equals 1.

00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:23.040
This is, we split it up again into a part that we don't really care about.

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:38.360
Plus an interesting part. Remember, little m is the thing that's changing. This should look like a little m compared to m0.

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:59.760
And this is less than or equal to sum from n equals 1 to m0, x of n. Again, this is just a fixed number. Plus, now we can put this inequality, n equals m0 plus 1, m alpha to the n.

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:21.080
And this is less than or equal to sum from n equals m0. I'm going to go kind of fast here because I'm running out of space on the board here. Maybe I'll write this out in just a minute, but why this is true.

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:31.320
And this part here is less than or equal to 1 over 1 minus alpha. Because what do I do? This sum is a finite sum.

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:46.740
And it's certainly bigger than if I make the lower bound smaller and the upper bound larger.

00:37:49.440 --> 00:38:04.020
And this is just the impth partial sum corresponding to a geometric series with non-negative terms, alpha to the n. And so that's less than or equal to sum from n equals 0 to infinity of alpha to the n, which equals 1 over 1 minus alpha.

00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:22.420
So that's how we got this term. And therefore, the partial sums corresponding to the absolute values is bounded. And therefore, that series with the absolute values converges and we have absolute convergence.

00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:42.320
Alright, so now let me state a theorem about alternating series. It is not, I prefer not to call it an alternating series test because there's nothing really to test.

00:38:42.320 --> 00:39:10.940
I mean, at least with the ratio and root test, you have to compute a limit, which might require some work to do. And therefore, at least to me, that's kind of a real thing that you have to do a little work to test whether a series converges.

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:28.080
And for alternating series, the test is you look at it. And that's it. You don't compute anything. You look at it. So I prefer not to call this theorem about alternating series and alternating series test.

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:47.660
So the theorem is for alternating series. And statement is the following.

00:39:50.760 --> 00:40:04.700
Let x sub n be a monotone decreasing sequence

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:27.820
converging to zero. So because this thing is monotone decreasing and converging to zero, it's all, so let me put this in parentheses.

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:36.240
For xn is bigger than or equal to zero for all n.

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:51.060
I cannot have a monotone decreasing sequence converging to zero if one of the xn is less than zero because they keep getting smaller.

00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:18.960
This is it. This is not all of the hypotheses. You don't have to compute anything. Then the series minus one to the n, xn equals, let's, of course, you know, we don't have to start at one in particular.

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:28.500
But at least for this statement, let's make it precise. Some from n equals one to infinity of minus one to the n, x of n converges.

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:44.800
And we can just say convergence, not necessarily absolute convergence because again, if we look at minus one to the n, one over n, which is one over n is a monotone decreasing sequence converging to zero, that converges but not absolutely.

00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:57.280
And if we have x sub n equal one over n squared, again, one over n squared is a monotone decreasing sequence converging to zero, that would converge absolutely.

00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:59.320
So we just have a statement about convergence.

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:29.300
So how we're going to do this is we are, it's kind of like how we proved convergence for p-series in that we're going to show that a certain number of convergence converges.

00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:38.960
Subsequence of partial sums converges and then we're going to use that to show that the full sequence of partial sums converge.

00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:51.460
Let me state this is claim one.

00:42:51.460 --> 00:43:03.400
So the subsequence of partial sums is sub two k.

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:09.680
So this is just a sum from n equals one to two k.

00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:20.600
I'm going to show this converges.

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:35.640
So again, just to complete s of m, this is the nth partial sum is the sum from n equals one to m.

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:54.720
So how we're going to do this is we're going to show that these partial sums are in fact monotone decreasing and bounded from below.

00:43:54.720 --> 00:44:08.100
So monotone decreasing basically because these guys are monotone decreasing and bounded from below by the same reason.

00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:12.440
So let's show that.

00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:26.960
Okay, a natural number. If I look at s2k.

00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:53.020
So this is the sum.

00:44:53.020 --> 00:45:19.640
So this is the sum of n equals two k.

00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:30.560
Now, this sequence is monotone decreasing.

00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:34.540
So x of two is going to be smaller than x of one.

00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:38.900
x of four is going to be less than x of three.

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:45.620
x of two k minus two k minus one is less than zero.

00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:52.520
So since this is monotone decreasing, this is bigger than or equal to.

00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:04.300
So what I just said has nothing to do with this inequality I'm writing here yet.

00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:18.460
So I kept everything here and now I add x of two k plus two minus x of two k plus one.

00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:26.460
Okay, so what I was saying was that the x of n's are monotone decreasing.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:33.140
This term is right after this term. So it's smaller than this term.

00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:37.960
So this term here is less than or equal to zero.

00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:49.800
Okay, and therefore this thing plus itself plus something that's negative is less than or equal to this thing.

00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:51.280
Okay.

00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:04.680
Now, what is this thing on the right hand side? This is just.

00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:24.560
x two k minus plus x two k minus x two k plus one plus x of two k plus one.

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:32.180
And this is the k plus one two k plus one partial sum.

00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:35.620
All right.

00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:56.740
This series is monotone decreasing.

00:47:58.020 --> 00:47:58.540
Okay.

00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:16.780
So to show that this sub sequence of partial sums converges, we just have to show that this sub sequence is bounded, right, or bounded below.

00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:22.540
If it's monotone decreasing, it's already bounded above by something.

00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:24.400
So we just need to show it's bounded from below.

00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:41.760
Now, for okay, a natural number, let's look at s of two k and group term slightly differently.

00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:50.440
Okay. So this is equal now to, I'm going to write it as minus x one plus x.

00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:17.640
So three.

00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:28.000
Okay.

00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:37.260
Okay. So this is minus two plus x of two k.

00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:40.680
Okay. Okay.

00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:46.340
Okay. So this is equal to minus.

00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:50.300
So again, the x of n's are monotone decreasing.

00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:56.120
All right. So, except three is smaller than except two.

00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:57.400
So this is non-negative.

00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:05.280
This is also non-negative because x sub five is smaller than x sub four.

00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:08.640
So one and so on. So this is also non-negative.

00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:18.320
So s of two k is bigger than or equal to minus x of one plus non-negative term.

00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:23.560
So two k and remember, x sub n's.

00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:25.960
These are monotone decreasing, converging to zero.

00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:27.860
And therefore, they're all non-negative.

00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:31.760
So this is bigger than or equal to minus x of one.

00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:32.900
Okay.

00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:43.080
Thus, what do we get?

00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:51.540
So for all natural numbers k, I have minus x one is less than or equal to s of two k.

00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:57.400
And because these are monotone decreasing, this is always less than or equal to s k equals one.

00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:08.220
All right. And this is a, so if you like s of two is just minus x of one plus x of two.

00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:14.360
So this sequence of numbers is bounded between this real number and this real number.

00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:15.380
And therefore, it's bounded.

00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:18.600
And since it's monotone decreasing, it has to have a limit.

00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:39.180
So s of two k converges.

00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:48.960
Let's call this limit something.

00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:51.580
Let's call it s.

00:51:55.120 --> 00:52:02.220
All right. We'll show that the sequence of partial sums converge to s now.

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:06.940
We just showed this for a longer sequence of, a longer sub sequence of partial sums.

00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:09.700
So let's show it converges to s along the full sequence.

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:32.080
So this is, if you like, claim two, which is that the full sequence of partial sums converges to s.

00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:42.840
All right. And we're going to do this by brute force using epsilon m argument.

00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:51.220
So remember to show something, a limit of something equals s means for all epsilon, there exists a capital m.

00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:58.140
So that for all n bigger than or equal to capital m, s of m minus s, an absolute value is less than epsilon.

00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:00.280
Okay. So let epsilon be positive.

00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:19.860
So two k converges to s, there exists n and zero, natural number, so that all k bigger than or equal to m zero.

00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:28.020
So s of two k minus s, an absolute value is less than epsilon.

00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:39.060
Now, we haven't used it all in this proof that the x n's really converged to zero.

00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:41.160
We did use that they were not negative at one point.

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:46.960
But now this is where we'll use a converges to zero because here's the intuition.

00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:51.920
The s of two k's are converging to something.

00:53:52.920 --> 00:54:00.100
So now I just have to look at the odd ones. I've shown all the even partial sums converge to s.

00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:05.180
So if I can show the odd partial sums also converge to s, then essentially I'm done.

00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:09.040
What's the difference between an even partial sum and an odd partial sum?

00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:15.860
Well, it's just x to the two k plus x sub two k plus one, which is converging to zero.

00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:19.160
So they don't differ by much.

00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:24.460
And that's essentially the whole argument right there.

00:54:24.460 --> 00:54:35.580
So since x n's converged to zero, there exists natural number m sub one.

00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:45.980
So that for all n bigger than or equal to m sub one, x of n is less than epsilon over two.

00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:47.780
I should put an epsilon over two here.

00:54:54.800 --> 00:55:04.440
Choose m to be the maximum of two numbers, two m zero plus one, m m one.

00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:07.200
So you'll see why I made these choices in just a minute.

00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:15.500
So suppose m is bigger than or equal to m.

00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:21.120
We now want to show that s sub m minus s is less than epsilon in absolute value.

00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:36.040
So there's two cases. If m is even, then m over two is bigger than or equal to capital m over two,

00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:42.040
which is the max of these, if I divide by two, that's certainly bigger than or equal to m zero.

00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:55.000
And therefore, I use this first inequality, s sub m minus s, which is equal to s two times m over two minus s.

00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:59.960
Now m over two is an integer bigger than or equal to m sub zero.

00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:05.360
So I can use this inequality, s less than epsilon over two, which is less than epsilon.

00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:13.740
And now we do odd.

00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:30.500
So again, m is bigger than or equal to capital m.

00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:33.900
And there's two cases. m even and m odd, if m is odd.

00:56:35.820 --> 00:56:42.860
But k be this integer now. Since m is odd, m minus one is even divided by two, that's an integer.

00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:56.000
And so this is so m equals two k plus one.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:11.940
And since m is bigger than or equal to m zero, this implies a couple of things.

00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:21.940
This implies that this integer, so m, this implies that two k plus one is bigger than or equal to two.

00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:31.300
So m is just equal to two k plus one, so that's bigger than or equal to m, which is bigger than or equal to two m sub zero plus one.

00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:38.920
And therefore k, this integer here is bigger than m zero.

00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:52.040
Also m is bigger than or equal to m sub one as well.

00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:56.440
I mean m is bigger than or equal to m and m is bigger than or equal to the max of these two things.

00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:57.900
So it's bigger than or equal to m one.

00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:10.800
Then if I look at s of m minus s, this is equal to s of m.

00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:24.540
So the mth partial sum is equal to the m minus first partial sum plus the next term minus s.

00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:34.320
Now m minus one in terms of the integer k is equal to two times k.

00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:44.380
And now I'm going to take this s and group it with this guy.

00:58:56.640 --> 00:59:07.340
And so since k is bigger than or equal to m sub zero, we can use this inequality here after we do the triangle inequality.

00:59:07.340 --> 00:59:12.440
So this is less than or equal to s two k minus s plus the absolute value of this thing.

00:59:15.660 --> 00:59:29.140
So again, since k is bigger than or equal to m sub zero, I can use this inequality to get this is less than epsilon over two plus this guy.

00:59:29.140 --> 00:59:37.120
And since m is bigger than or equal to m, which is bigger than or equal to m sub one, I can use this inequality.

00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:42.900
And this is less than epsilon.

00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:51.780
So we've done the case of m even or m odd m bigger than or equal to m.

00:59:52.080 --> 01:00:01.780
So in summary, we've shown that if m is bigger than or equal to m, s of m minus s is less than epsilon.

01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:06.960
And therefore the s of m's converge to s.

01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:10.940
And I don't think I have enough time to do this next term.

01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:13.020
So we'll stop there.
