00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.040
So let's continue our discussion of continuity, which we began

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:28.880
last time, which I defined last time, and I wrote again here.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.300
Which intuitively says that if you want to be that if x is

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:44.560
sufficiently close to number c, then f of x will be very close to f of c.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.580
So it connects how the function behaves near a point to how a function behaves at the point.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.920
And last time we gave an example of a function which is continuous everywhere,

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:07.080
namely the function f of x equals a x plus b.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.440
And one that was not continuous at a point c.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:20.020
And we ended with, let me just recall the question I asked last time, if f is a function,

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:31.160
let's say that its whole domain is r. Does there exist a point where it's continuous?

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:53.540
Okay. Okay. Now I could answer this question now just using the definition, but I'll answer it in a minute after we prove

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.780
following theorem, which is an analog of this theorem that we proved here for limits.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:11.380
Right? We showed that if you have a subset s of r, a cluster point of s, so this is where you take limits.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:19.560
And then the limit as x goes to c of f of x equals l, if and only if for every sequence converging to c,

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:29.640
we have f of x n, which is a new sequence converges to l. So this connects limits of functions to limits of sequences.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.840
Limits along sequences, if you like. We're going to prove an analog of this theorem now for the notion of continuity.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:48.620
But you know, there's kind of a, and these two definitions certainly look, if you look at the definition of limit and the definition of continuity,

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:56.280
they certainly, this one certainly looks like the definition of limit where now the limit has to be f of c, the function evaluated at that point.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:08.800
And it essentially is, but we do have a kind of degenerate case where c here is not required to be a cluster point of s. It's just any point of s.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:19.540
And we'll have two cases c as a cluster point of s and c is not a cluster point of s. And you'll see that when c is not a cluster point of s,

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:39.800
we'll have kind of a silly situation for talking about continuity. So this is the following theorem, which has three parts. So suppose s is the subset of r, c is an element of s.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:04:03.920
F is a function from s to r. So the first part is, if c is not a cluster point of s, then f is continuous at c.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:15.860
So if we're looking at continuity at a point, kind of the only interesting points to look at are cluster points of the set s. Otherwise, no matter what function it is, it will be continuous at such a point.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:30.540
The second is that now, let's suppose we're in the more interesting case that c is a cluster point of s. Suppose c is a cluster point of s.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:45.180
Then, which is essentially the only thing that's missing from this definition and the definition for limit.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:58.800
Then, f is continuous at c. And this is born out in the theorem. If and only if the limit as x goes to c of f of x equals f of c.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:14.440
And the third part of this theorem, which is now the analog of this theorem we proved here for limits, is the following.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:43.900
F is continuous at c. If and only if for every sequence x n of elements of s, such that x of n converges to c.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:04.160
So, again, if c is not a cluster point of the set, then every function is going to be continuous at that point.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:11.940
So, this is kind of a, so c is not a cluster point of s. This is kind of a silly case to look at.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:20.200
Okay. All right. So, let's prove the first theorem. I mean, the first part of this theorem.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:34.800
So, what's the intuition? Remember continuity is a connection between f near a point and the function at the point.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:48.100
Now, if the only points near c is c, then f of x equals f of c for x near c because x can only be c. And therefore, that will be less than epsilon.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:07:02.000
So, you know, when we're at a point that's not a cluster point, it kind of removes the near part and we're just looking at f at c and comparing f to itself at c.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:17.680
So, let's suppose f is not a cluster point. So, we want to prove continuity. So, that's a for all epsilon delta arguments. So, let epsilon be positive.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:38.540
Since c is not a cluster point of s, what does this mean? So, remember, to be a cluster point of a set s means for all delta positive there exists.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:08:04.980
So, let me recall what it means to be a cluster point over here on the side. So, c is a cluster point of s. This means for all delta positive, the set x minus delta x plus delta intersect.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:26.400
So, c intersect s, takeaway c is non-empty. So, since c is not a cluster point, that means for exists some delta zero. So, that this interval is disjoint from s, takeaway c.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:54.180
Such that c minus delta zero, c plus delta zero intersect s, takeaway c equals the empty set. Now, if I include c in this intersection, so another way of stating this is that the only thing since c is an element of s,

00:08:54.180 --> 00:09:16.680
the only thing that's in this intersection is c. So, this here is the rigorous way of saying there's nothing in s near c except for c itself.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:31.920
And therefore, there's nothing to compare to f of c. So, we'll choose delta to be this one because then there's nothing, there's no x in s in this interval other than c. And then f of c minus f of c is zero.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:57.500
So, choose delta to be delta zero. Then if x minus, so now we want to say that this delta works. So, if x is an s, and x minus c is less than delta, that implies x equals c.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:16.180
Because the only thing in this interval that's coming from s is c. And therefore, f of x minus f of c, this is equal to f of c minus f of c equals zero, which is less than epsilon.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:27.500
So, this is a really degenerate case of when you're trying to see if a function's continuous at a certain point.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:44.440
So, let's now move to the more interesting part that c is a cluster point.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:11:06.040
So, suppose c is a cluster point of s. And we want to show f is continuous at c if and only f the limit of f of x goes to c of f of x equals f of c.

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:17.540
So, going this direction is really quite easy. So, we're going to go this direction and you should be able to prove this direction just from what I write down here.

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:41.780
So, suppose the limit as x goes to c of f of x equals f of c. I mean this whole argument is kind of silly because the definitions are just so close except for the, you know, now c is a cluster point, so that's not missing from either definition.

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:48.540
But the only difference is this guy, you only look at x and c, but not at c.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:57.660
So, suppose the limit as x goes to c of f of x equals f of c. Now, we want to show that f of x is continuous at c.

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:24.020
So, let epsilon be positive since we have this, there exists a delta positive such that if x is in s

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:38.960
and the absolute value of x minus c is bigger than 0 is less than delta 0 than f of x minus f of c is less than epsilon.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:59.180
And we'll just choose delta to be this delta 0. If x minus c is less than delta 0, then there are two cases. Either x is equal to c or x is not equal to z.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.540
So, let's write it this way.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:30.640
If x equals c, then clearly f of x minus f of c equals f of c minus f of c equals 0 is less than epsilon.

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:53.280
And if x not equals c, then that's certainly bigger than 0, but we're still assuming it's less than delta, which remembers this delta 0 coming from the fact that the limit as x goes to c of f of x, kind of missed that there.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:14:12.980
It tells me that this is less than epsilon. So, it's just follows immediately, like from the definitions. There's not much to it.

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:31.060
So, now let's prove the third part of this theorem, which is an analog of that theorem we have over there for limits.

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:51.140
So, let's prove this direction. Let's suppose f is continuous at c. And now we want to prove this statement about sequences.

00:14:51.140 --> 00:15:02.300
So, let me also prove the opposite direction, not have to label it. So, let me put a star. This star is going to be the right hand side of this statement.

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:23.200
So, let x sub n be a sequence in s. So, of elements of s, so that x n converges to c.

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:47.940
Now, do this picture for limits, and it's the same picture now for this guy. And we're wanting to show now that limit as n goes to infinity of f of x sub n equals f of c.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:16:06.560
So, here's epsilon m arguments, so let epsilon be positive. So, now I'll go to the picture. Here's f of c. Here's f of c plus epsilon f of c minus epsilon.

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:32.500
So, what do we know? We know the function is continuous at c. So, that means that if I look at c, then there exists a delta, so that if I'm in this interval here, everything in this interval gets mapped to inside of this interval.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:53.500
Now, what else do I know, or what else am I assuming? x sub n is a sequence converging to s. So, for large n, for n big enough, for some capital m zero, x sub n is going to lie inside this interval.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:17:01.340
If you like in the definition of convergence of a sequence, epsilon is equal to delta in that definition, but don't mind that.

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:20.600
So, for all n big enough, x sub n lies in this interval, and since this interval gets mapped inside this interval by f, this f of x sub n will end up in this interval within epsilon to f of c, as long as n is big enough.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:27.020
So, this picture I just went through, this is the proof, and now we just need to write it out.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:57.000
So, since f is continuous at c, there exists a delta positive such that if x minus c is less than delta, this delta is less than delta.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:24.460
So, this tells me f of x minus f of c is less than epsilon. Now, since the sequence x sub n converges to c, there exists some integer capital m zero such that for all n bigger than or equal to m zero, x sub n minus c is less than delta.

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:34.100
And therefore, for all n bigger than or equal to m sub zero, f of x n will be within epsilon of f of c.

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:56.300
So, this will be the m we choose, then if n is bigger than or equal to m, we get that x of n minus x minus c is less than delta, which implies by how delta is defined.

00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:13.400
If x minus c is within distance delta, f of x minus f of c is within distance epsilon, we get f of x sub n minus f of c is less than epsilon.

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:19.860
So, that gives us one direction.

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:49.540
So, now we'll prove the opposite direction. So, we're assuming that this statement star holds, namely for all sequence x sub n's converging to c, we have f of x sub n converging to f of c.

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:56.780
And we want to prove that the limit or that f is continuous at c.

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:09.760
Okay? And we're going to do this by contradiction, which is the same way we proved the opposite direction for the theorem about limits.

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:29.440
So, proof is by contradiction, namely suppose the conclusion we want does not hold. So, suppose f is not continuous at c.

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:50.480
So, let me recall, we negated that definition in the last lecture, but we'll negate it again for this. This means that there exists a bad epsilon so that for all delta positive, there exists an x and s satisfying x minus c is less than delta.

00:20:54.180 --> 00:21:01.340
And f of x minus f of c is bigger than or equal to epsilon zero.

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:03.080


00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:26.360
Okay? All right. So, we apply, so since we're assuming f is not continuous, there exists an epsilon zero, so we have all this. So, which holds for every delta, and now we'll choose delta to be one, one half, one third, and so on.

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:45.820
And there exists an x of one and s such that x of one minus c is less than one. And f of x of one minus f of c is bigger than or equal to epsilon zero.

00:21:45.820 --> 00:22:04.260
That's just delta if you like delta equals one. And now we continue, there exists an x of two and s such that x of two minus c is less than a half.

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:18.200
And so here, this is delta equals a half. So, this is delta equals a half and so on. Okay? So, then we conclude.

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:47.000
So, you know, if you like omit this from the proof and this is really what's behind the next statement I'm about to make, then for all natural numbers n, there exists an x of n and s such that x of n minus c is less than one over n.

00:22:48.580 --> 00:23:11.260
And f of x of n minus f of c is bigger than or equal to epsilon zero. Okay? Now, let's take a look at this sequence. All right, we're trying to break something and we'll end up breaking the assumption, the star assumption. Right?

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:27.020
So, this is the first of s which are getting closer and closer to c. So, we have zero is bigger than or equal to x of n minus c is bigger is less than one over n. So, this converges to zero. This converges to zero.

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:42.940
So, by the squeeze theorem, the absolute value of x of n minus c converges to zero. And therefore, x of n converges to c. By squeeze theorem, we get that x n converges to c.

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:55.600
Now, since we're assuming star holds, that's the right side of three of the if and only if. It must be the case that f of x n converges to f of c.

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:22.780
Right? That's what star tells me that if I take a sequence converging to c f of x n converges to f of c. But each one of these remember is bigger than or equal to epsilon zero.

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:47.060
Which is a contradiction, epsilon zero is a positive number. And that concludes the proof of this theorem that gives us an equivalent way of stating continuity in terms of sequences.

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:59.940
And, you know, just like for limits, this will allow us to use what we know about sequences to conclude analogous facts for continuous functions.

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:18.760
So, let's look at a non-trivial example of a continuous function.

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:39.960
And also put this theorem to use this previous theorem functions f of x equals sine x. And g of x equals cosine x. These are continuous functions.

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:55.740
So, meaning their domain is a set of real numbers. So, they're continuous at every real number. They're continuous at c for every c real number.

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:16.000
So, we're going to use this, well, we're not going to use this theorem just yet on this part. We're actually going to prove sine is continuous directly from the epsilon delta definition.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:34.700
Which is always good. So, first we claim sine x. So, before I state what we're going to do, let me just give you a quick refresher on what you can prove just from the definition of sine and cosine.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:51.040
Remember, you know, I'm not, I would usually put this to the class and see who remembers and who doesn't. But, so this is also supposed to be a unit circle, although it doesn't quite look like that.

00:26:51.780 --> 00:27:13.600
Remember, that sine and cosine are defined as you travel along, signed distance x along the circle. And you arrive at a point on the unit circle, which you, so it's an ordered pair.

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:26.160
So, here, the first element you call cosine x, the second element you call sine x. So, that's how sine of x is defined. So, now simply, I'm not going to do these because this is trig.

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:42.640
Not analysis, but from the definition of sine and cosine from the unit circle.

00:27:45.780 --> 00:28:08.420
So, we have that, of course, all x and r sine x plus cosine squared x is equal to 1. And therefore, each of these individual things has to be less than or equal to 1, which upon taking square roots means that

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:38.400
you can also make a better estimate for sine x when x is close to 0, which is only useful for x close to 0, but which is the following that for all x sine x is less than or equal to the absolute value of x.

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:50.300
So, you have x just obtained by comparing the length of one side of a triangle from this picture with the length of the arc.

00:28:50.300 --> 00:29:18.560
So, you have this, and then you also have the angle sum formula, which says that sine of a plus b equals sine a cosine b plus cosine a sine b.

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:42.880
And you also have the, I can't remember the name of the exact formula. I think it's a difference to a product or something of that nature, but which says sine of a minus sine of b, you can write.

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:53.980
So, this is using the previous formula twice sine of a minus b over 2 cosine of a plus b over 2.

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:06.180
So, using these elementary properties of sine and cosine, we'll now show that f is, or that sine of x is continuous.

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:26.600
So, first thing we want to show is that sine x is continuous function.

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:47.680
So, let's see an r, we're going to show sine as continuous as c, let epsilon be positive. And now we have to say how to choose delta, depending on this epsilon, choose delta to be epsilon.

00:30:52.340 --> 00:31:11.500
Now, we'll use these elementary properties to show that this delta works. Then, if x minus c is less than delta, we now want to show that f of x minus f of c sine x minus sine c is less than epsilon.

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:33.000
So, sine x minus sine c, this is equal to by this last formula we have on the board over here. This is equal to twice sine x minus c over 2 cosine x plus c over 2.

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:51.800
And now, this is the product of 2 times absolute value of sine times absolute value of cosine. By the second property over here, cosine is always bounded by 1. So, this is less than or equal to 2 times the absolute value of sine x minus c over 2.

00:31:53.320 --> 00:32:08.180
And now, we use this third property here that sine x is less than or equal to the absolute value of that thing you're sticking in. So, this is less than or equal to 2 times x minus c over 2, which equals x minus c.

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:20.100
So, now, we're in business, we've connected f of x to x minus c. So, this is less than or equal to, so this is less than delta, which equals epsilon by our choice of delta.

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:24.880
And therefore, sine x minus sine c is less than epsilon.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:45.680
So, sine x minus sine c is less than epsilon. So, this function sine x is continuous at c.

00:32:52.080 --> 00:33:14.520
Now, we'll use this and the theorem we showed a minute ago. Have I erased it? Yes, I have now officially erased it. Anyways, we used the previous theorem that we proved for the equivalence of continuity and convergence of sequences to show that cosine is continuous.

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:38.480
So, let's see the element of r. Let xn be a sequence, converging to c.

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:54.140
And we now want to show that cosine of x of n converges to cosine of c.

00:33:55.300 --> 00:34:02.420
Once we've done that, then by the theorem we proved, previously we can conclude that cosine is continuous at c.

00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:28.500
Now, here's the thing. For all x and r, we have cosine of x is equal to sine of x plus pi over 2.

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:42.780
So, we can deduce that simply from this angle sum formula. Take a equals x, b equals pi over 2. And using that cosine of pi over 2 is 0.

00:34:45.160 --> 00:35:03.120
And this is what we'll use. And the fact that we know sine is continuous. Since the sequence x in converges to c, this implies the sequence x sub n plus pi over 2 converges to c plus pi over 2.

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:21.520
Now, this sequence x sub n plus pi over 2 converges to this number. And since sine is continuous, we have by the previous theorem, that sine of this converges to this.

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:46.500
And therefore, cosine of cosine of x sub n, which is equal to sine of x sub n plus pi over 2 converges to sine of c plus pi over 2, which equals cosine of c.

00:35:50.380 --> 00:36:02.680
So, cosine of x sub n converges to cosine of c. And therefore, we've now shown that cosine is also continuous.

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:29.180
So, let's answer this question real quick. So, the answer is no. You can find a function which is discontinuous at every point, every real number.

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:37.480
So, maybe this is an example rather than a theorem, but I'll state it as a theorem.

00:36:40.720 --> 00:37:05.660
Let f of x be the function, which takes the value 1. If x is a rational, 0. If x is not a rational, then f is...

00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:27.320
not continuous at every c and r. So, first off, don't try to plot this using like matlab or mathematical or anything, because first off, computers can't deal with irrational numbers.

00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:42.720
So, you will just get 1, no matter what you stick into f. But, okay, so you have this function, which is 1, if x is a rational, 0, if x is not a rational number, if it's irrational.

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:54.940
Let's show it's discontinuous at every c. A different way, if you like, to state the theorem which I've already erased.

00:37:54.940 --> 00:38:14.960
So, but let me just state it slightly differently. F is not continuous at c. So, remember the two statements are equivalent, if and only if they're negations are equivalent.

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:34.060
So, f is not continuous at c. If and only if there exists a sequence x of n, such that x n's converged to c.

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:59.520
So, maybe it just doesn't converge at all, or maybe it converges to something other than f of c. So, this is just a restatement of the theorem we've already proven.

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:17.220
But, now using negations of the statements that appeared on the if and only if. So, there's two cases. So, to consider for this, so now we're going, so this is a statement of the theorem that we're used, or restatement of the theorem we're using.

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:27.960
And now we're going to prove the theorem that I've stated here. So, let c be an element of r. We're going to show that this function is discontinuous at c. There are two cases to consider.

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:42.140
C is a rational number, or c is an irrational number. So, case 1, c is rational number. Let's show f is not continuous at c.

00:39:49.260 --> 00:40:08.400
So, now we know that for every natural number in, there exists an element x of n, and the complement of q. So, an irrational number.

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:22.780
So, we prove this in an assignment. Between any two real numbers, I can find an irrational number in between them.

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:32.120
So, that's what this statement says. For each n, I can find an irrational number between the number c and the number c plus 1 over n.

00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:52.460
Now, by the squeeze theorem, this is just a constant sequence if you like, converging to c, this converges to c. And as n goes to infinity, this converges to c. So, I get that the sequence x sub n converges to c.

00:40:54.240 --> 00:41:20.140
This will be my bad sequence to satisfy this conclusion. Because, so, x n converges to c. But, if I look at f of x n, if I take the limit as n goes to infinity of f of x n,

00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:38.700
since all the x ns are not rational, they're irrational numbers, and I stick them into f, I get 0, 0, and this does not equal 1, which equals f of c. Because, we're in the case that c is a rational number.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:59.680
So, here we use the density of the irrationals to show that this function is not continuous at a rational number. And we'll do the same thing for the case that c is an irrational number.

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:15.500
I mean, it's the same proof except now we essentially take compliments. We proved the theorem right after the Archimedean property of r that for any two real numbers, I can find a rational number in between them.

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:31.100
So, for every n, there exists a rational number such that c is less than x sub n is less than c plus 1 over n.

00:42:36.260 --> 00:43:00.500
And again, by the squeeze theorem, it follows that x n converges to c. And if we look at the limit as n goes to infinity of f of x sub n, this is equal to all of these values are 1, which does not equal 0.

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:25.740
So, this function is not continuous at every real number. So, just terminology here. If you hear me say this, when I say something is not continuous, I'll often say discontinuous.

00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:51.540
Okay, we're going to use this theorem. Now, I keep saying this theorem, although I already erased it, but the theorem that equates continuity at a point in the fact that every sequence converges to c implies f of x n converges to f of c.

00:43:51.540 --> 00:44:07.540
So, we're going to use that theorem to get kind of corresponding theorems about continuity that look kind of analogous to statements we made about sequences.

00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:47.020
And then we'll consider a case which is not covered, which has no analog for sequences. So, let me say the following theorem. So, suppose s is the subset of r, c is an element of s. And I have two functions from s to r.

00:44:47.020 --> 00:45:13.700
Then, if f and g are continuous at c, then the conclusion is f plus g. The function f plus g is continuous at c.

00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:36.600
So, if f times g is continuous at c, and if g of x does not equal zero for all x and s. So, I can divide by it.

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:49.380
Then, f over g is continuous at c.

00:45:56.220 --> 00:46:11.020
And so, for example, I'll prove the first statement, the other two you can prove for yourself. And again, this just follows from this characterization we have of a function being continuous at a point in terms of limits of sequences.

00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:28.820
And limits of sequences, we know well. We've proven all these properties about them. If you'd like, that's where we did all the hard work. And now, getting some payoff in that we get interesting statements without a whole lot of work.

00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:39.320
So, we're assuming f and g are continuous at c. So, let's prove f plus g is continuous at c via this sequential characterization.

00:46:40.600 --> 00:47:04.160
Suppose, xn is the sequence converging to c. Then, since f and g are continuous at c, this implies that the sequence is f of x of n converges to f of c.

00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:20.420
And g of x of n converges to g of c. And therefore, by the theorem we proved several lectures ago that the sum of two convergent sequences converges to the sum of the limits.

00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:39.820
So, we get that f plus g of x of n, which is f of x of n plus g of x of n converges to f of c plus g of c or function f plus g evaluated at c.

00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:58.960
And that's it. We've now shown that every sequence converging to c, f plus g of x of n converges to f plus g of c. And similarly, for others, although there's maybe a little bit of a small hiccup here in that you want to, well, no.

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:18.980
Right. So, this follows, I was thinking of something else, don't worry about that. But they, two and three also follow similarly using the sequential analogous sequential theorems.

00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:53.780
However, we do have, so these are kind of three natural operations we can do with two functions. We can add them, we can multiply them, we can divide them, just like we had for sequences.

00:48:53.780 --> 00:49:00.500
There is one operation we can do with functions that you don't do with sequences or can't do with sequences and that's composed them.

00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:11.660
So, the natural question is, is the composition of two continuous functions continuous? And the answer to that is yes. We have to state this carefully.

00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:27.040
So, suppose a and b are a subset of r and c is an element of a.

00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:48.440
So, let's write this a little bit different. A and b be a subset of r, c is an element of a and f will be a function from, let me get this right.

00:49:52.240 --> 00:50:03.540
f will be a function from a to r and g is a function from a set b to a. And, okay, so I'm getting this backwards.

00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:14.260
So, when I compose these two, when I take f of g, f of g will be a function now from b to r.

00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:36.360
So, if g is continuous at c and f is continuous at the point g of c, which is, remember, an element of a.

00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:50.520
Then the composition f of g is continuous at c.

00:50:56.240 --> 00:51:00.280
So, we'll use again this characterization in terms of sequences.

00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:13.620
We don't necessarily have to, we could have done it strictly speaking from the definition, but this is a nice short way of proving this statement.

00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:27.380
So, an x in be a sequence in b. So, a element of b such that x sub n converges to c.

00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:43.640
And, what we want to show is that f of g limit as n goes to infinity of f of g of x sub n equals f of g of c.

00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:48.940
Let's put this up to the side.

00:51:49.940 --> 00:52:16.480
Okay, so since x n's converges to c and g is continuous at c, this implies that the sequence g of x n converges to g of c.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:25.120
Now, g of x sub n, this is a sequence now in a converging to an element of a.

00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:55.100
Yeah, so since this sequence g of x sub n converges to g of c and g now f is continuous at g of c, this implies that f of g of x sub n converges to f of g of x sub n.

00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:22.500
So, we have a new, we have an operation that we can't do with sequences, but this operation still preserves continuity.

00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:36.700
So, taking sums of continuous functions, maintains and stays in the class of continuous functions, product of two continuous functions is continuous, quotient is continuous.

00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:45.880
And now also the composition of two continuous functions is continuous.

00:53:50.680 --> 00:54:03.240
Now, so as a consequence of this, we can use this to prove some, give more examples of functions which are continuous.

00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:23.120
So, for example, draw in the natural number, f of x equals x to the n is continuous as a function for x and r.

00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:29.540
So, what's the proof? We can do this by induction.

00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:43.240
So, for n equals 1, f of x equals x, we've already done.

00:54:51.960 --> 00:55:01.800
So, this is the base case, let's now do the inductive step.

00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:15.500
Suppose that the function x to the m is continuous and now we want to show x to the m plus 1 is continuous.

00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:35.660
Then x to the m plus 1, this is equal to x times x to the m. And since x to the m is continuous and the function x, f of x equals x is continuous, the product of two continuous functions is continuous.

00:55:42.980 --> 00:56:05.640
This is the product of two continuous functions, which by the theorem we proved implies that x to the m plus 1 is continuous.

00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:17.980
So, I keep saying continuous, but what I'm saying is for all c and r, x to the m is continuous at c.

00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:24.000
So, maybe I should have written that down, but I think that meaning should be clear enough.

00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:35.460
And by the same inductive reasoning, you could also prove that,

00:56:35.460 --> 00:57:05.440
that the function x to the m is continuous.

00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:23.000
So, rather than write down the actual proof by induction, let's talk our way through it.

00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:32.400
So, again, for n equals 1, this is just going to be some number times x, which we've already dealt with in a previous example, so we know that's continuous.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:45.240
So, that settles the base case. Now, let's assume that we've proved this for n equals m, or let's assume this for n equals m, and look at a function with n equals m plus 1.

00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:54.840
That's going to be a to the a sub m plus 1 times x to the m plus 1 plus a lower order polynomial, which we already know is continuous.

00:57:55.980 --> 00:58:07.220
And a sub m plus 1 times x to the m plus 1, that's continuous, because it's the product of a constant and a continuous function by the previous example.

00:58:07.220 --> 00:58:16.580
So, that would be continuous plus the lower order polynomial, which is continuous by assumption, that will be continuous by the theorem that we proved.

00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:25.660
But, you know, you don't have to just look at polynomials, for example.

00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:50.460
So, for example, the function f of x equals 1 over 3 plus sine x to the fourth, this is also continuous, is a continuous function.

00:58:50.460 --> 00:59:01.020
Why? Because for all x, first off, 3 plus sine x to the fourth, this is never 0. So, this function makes perfectly good sense. So, the bottom is always non-zero.

00:59:02.220 --> 00:59:13.000
So, sine x is continuous, so sine x to the fourth is continuous. 3 is a continuous function, it's just a constant. So, the bottom as a function on its own is continuous.

00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:30.000
And, 1 over that function is continuous, as long as the bottom is never 0, which it's never 0. So, again, by this theorem here, so we used the composition one to say that sine x to the fourth is continuous.

00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:36.780
And, we used that one, the theorem before that to show that 1 over 3 plus sine x for is continuous.

00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:58.960
So, just let me write this out real quick. I will say by composition theorem, the function sine x to the fourth is continuous, which implies by, I'll say, algebra break theorem.

00:59:59.820 --> 01:00:26.200
Meaning, the theorem that involves algebraic operations. 3 plus sine x to the fourth is continuous. And, by the algebraic theorem again, since 3 plus sine x to the fourth is never 0 for all x and r.

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:33.080
It's continuous.

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:54.500
So, next time we'll look at some properties of continuous functions, namely, what are called the min and max theorems for continuous functions.

01:00:54.500 --> 01:01:13.800
So, the great thing about continuous functions is if you look at them on clothes and bounded intervals, they always attain a max and a minimum at some point. Not just that the graph is bounded above or below, but there's actual point that reaches that min and reaches that max.

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:18.640
And, then we'll also prove the intermediate value theorem, which says between any two.

01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:37.960
If I have a continuous function on an interval, a, b, and I look at f of a and f of b, and I take a number in between those two values, f of a and f of b, there exists a point in between them so that f attains that value.

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:41.840
And, this is extremely important.

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:50.480
And, we'll definitely see why later once we get to different stability and continuity.
