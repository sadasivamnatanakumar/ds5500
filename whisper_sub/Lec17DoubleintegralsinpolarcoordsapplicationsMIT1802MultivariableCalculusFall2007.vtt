00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.000
So yesterday we saw how to define double integrals

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.240
and how to start computing them in terms of x and y

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.660
coordinates.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:39.100
So we've defined the double integral of a region in plane

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.040
of a function f of xy dA.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.300
You can hear me.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.580
Is the sound working?

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.820
Can you hear me at the back now?

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.240
Can we make the sound louder?

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:57.440
Is this work?

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.880
Does this work?

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.560
And people are not hearing me at the back.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:02.340
Is it better?

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.800
People are still saying make it louder.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.340
Is it better?

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.260
OK, great.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.420
Thanks.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.300
So that's not an excuse to start chatting with your friends.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.420
Thanks.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.140
OK, so when we have a region in the xy plane

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.740
and we have a function of x and y,

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.760
we are defining the double integral of f over this region

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.880
by taking basically the sum of the values of a function

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.680
of a y and here times the area element.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.400
And the definition actually is we split the region

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.580
into lots of tiny little pieces.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.700
We multiply the value of the function at that point

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.980
times the area of a little piece and we sum that everywhere.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.100
And we've seen actually how to compute these things

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.980
as iterated integrals.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.480
So first integrating over dy, then over dx,

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:11.800
or the other way around.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.860
So one example that we did in particular

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:28.320
was to compute the double integral of a quarter of a unit

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.080
disk so that was the region where x squared plus y squared

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.880
is less than 1 and x and y are positive of 1 minus x squared

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.520
minus y squared dA.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.900
And well, hopefully I kind of convinced you

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.420
that we can do it using enough trig and substitutions

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.740
and so on, but it's not very pleasant.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.040
And the reason for that is that using x and y

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.600
coordinates here doesn't seem very appropriate.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.340
So in fact, we can use polar coordinates instead

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.260
to compute this double integral.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.360
So remember that polar coordinates

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.160
are about replacing x and y as coordinates

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.200
for a point in the plane by instead r, which

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.260
is the distance from the origin to our point,

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.840
and theta, which is the angle measured counterclockwise

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.220
from the positive x axis.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.380
So in terms of r and theta, you have x equals r cosine theta,

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.180
y equals r sine theta.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.460
So the claim is we are able actually

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.240
to do double integrals in polar coordinates,

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:59.980
we just have to learn how to.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:09.520
So just to draw a quick picture, when we were integrating

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.920
in x, y coordinates, in rectangular coordinates,

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.660
we were slicing our region by grid lines

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.380
that were either horizontal or vertical,

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.600
and we used that to set up the iterated integral.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.200
And we said dA became dx dy or dy dx.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.520
So now we are going to actually integrate

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.200
in terms of the polar coordinates r and theta.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:42.760
So let's say we will integrate in the order

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.440
well r first and then theta.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.860
That's the order that makes the most sense usually

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:49.860
when you do polar coordinates.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.440
So what does that mean?

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.400
It means that we will first focus on a slice

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.320
where we fix the value of theta.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.980
And we let r vary, so that means we fix a direction,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.760
we fix a ray out from the origin in a certain direction.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.460
And we'll travel along this ray and see which part of it,

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.880
which values of r are in our region.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.220
So here it will be actually pretty easy,

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.400
because r will just start at zero,

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.220
and you'll have to stop when you actually exit

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:27.940
this quarter disk.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.340
Well, what's the equation of this circle in polar coordinates?

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.720
It's just r equals 1.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.140
So we'll stop when r is 1.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.240
What about theta?

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.700
Well, the first ray that we might want to consider

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.900
is the one that goes along the x-axis.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.320
That's when theta equals zero,

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.280
and we'll stop when theta reaches pi over 2,

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.500
because we don't care about the rest of the disk.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.920
We only care about the first quadrant.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.160
So we'll stop at pi over 2.

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.980
Now there's a catch for,

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.820
which is that dA is not dr d theta.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.220
So let me explain to you why.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.760
So let's say that we are slicing,

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.300
what it means really is that we are cutting our region

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.340
into little pieces that are the elementary,

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.120
what corresponds to a small rectangle in the xy coordinate system.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.080
Here would be actually a little piece of circle

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:39.100
between a given radius r and r plus delta r,

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.300
and given an angle theta and theta plus delta theta.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.560
So I need to draw actually a bigger picture of it,

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.980
because it makes it really hard to read.

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.440
So let's say that I fix an angle theta,

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.060
and a slightly different one,

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.440
where I've added delta theta to it.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:06.520
And let's say that I have radius r,

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.960
and I add delta r to it.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.380
So then I'll have a little piece of xy plane that's in here,

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.440
and I have to figure out what is its area,

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:24.060
what is delta A for this guy.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.940
Well, let's see.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:32.560
This guy actually, if my delta r and delta theta are small enough,

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.800
it will almost look like a rectangle.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.440
It's rotated, but it's basically rectangle.

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.160
I mean, these sides, of course, are curvy,

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.780
but if they're short enough, it's almost straight.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:51.540
So the area here should be this length times that length.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.280
Well, what's this length?

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.540
That one is easy. It's delta r.

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:01.440
What about that length?

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.040
Well, it's not delta theta.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:04.220
It's something slightly different.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.000
It's a piece of a circle of radius r,

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.540
corresponding to angle delta theta.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.120
So it's r delta theta.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.300
So times r delta theta.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.400
So that means now, even if we shrink things

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.960
and take smaller and smaller radians,

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:34.300
dA is going to be r, dR, d theta.

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.300
Okay, so that's the important thing to remember.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.080
When you integrate in polar coordinates,

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:45.140
you just set up your bounds in terms of r and theta,

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:47.840
but you replace dA by r, dR, d theta.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.700
Not just dR, d theta.

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:56.220
And then, of course, we have some function that we're integrating.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.600
Let's say that I called that thing F.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.780
Then it's the same F that I put up here.

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.060
So concretely, how do I do it here?

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:16.300
Well, my function F was given as, you know,

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.520
1-x square-y square.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.940
And I like to switch that to polar coordinates.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.620
I want to put r and theta in there.

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.460
Well, I have formulas for x and y in polar coordinates.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:31.720
So I could just replace, you know, x squared by r squared cosine square theta.

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.860
y squared by r squared sine square theta.

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:36.640
And that works just fine.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:42.700
But maybe you can observe that this is actually, you know,

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.280
this is x squared plus y squared.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.140
It's just the square of a distance from the origin.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.300
So that's just r squared.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:49.700
Okay, that's a useful thing.

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:52.000
You know, if you don't strictly need it,

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.760
but it's much faster if you see this right away.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.060
It saves you, you know, writing down a sine and a cosine.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:11.340
So now we just end up with the integral from 0 to pi over 2,

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:19.140
integral from 0 to 1 of 1 minus r squared r, the theta.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.600
Now, if I want to compute this integral,

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.620
so let's first do the inner integral.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.820
So if I integrate r minus r cubed,

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:37.480
I will get r squared over 2 minus r squared over,

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:41.060
sorry, r to the 4 over 4 between 0 and 1.

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.560
And then I will integrate the theta.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.120
So what is this equal to?

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.980
Well, for r equals 1, you get 1 half minus a quarter.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:54.220
That's going to be just a quarter.

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.420
And when you plug 0, you get 0.

00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:01.940
So it's the integral from 0 to pi over 2 of 1 quarter, the theta.

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:06.760
And that just integrates to the quarter of pi over 2,

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.900
which is pi over 8.

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:11.080
Okay?

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.740
So that's a lot easier than the way we did it yesterday.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.680
Now, well, here we were lucky.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.300
I mean, usually you will switch to polar coordinates either

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.280
because the region is easier to set up.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:32.360
Here it's indeed easier to set up because, see, the bounds became very simple.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.160
We don't have that square root of 1 minus x squared anymore.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.860
Or because the integrant becomes much simpler.

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:43.240
Here, our function, well, it's not very complicated in xy coordinates,

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.740
but it's even simpler in our theta coordinates.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:48.380
So here we were very lucky.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:51.960
In general, there's maybe a trade-off.

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:53.720
Maybe it will be easier to set up the bounds,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.620
but maybe the function will become harder

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:58.040
because it will have all these signs and cosines in it.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:00.620
If our function had been just x,

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:03.580
x is very easy in xy coordinates.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.680
Here it becomes our cosine theta.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.880
That means you will have a little bit of trade to do in the integral.

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:13.260
Not a very big one, but not a very complicated integral.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.760
But imagine, you know, it could get potentially much harder.

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:24.540
Okay. So anyway, that's the whole integral in polar coordinates.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:30.900
And the way that you set up the bounds in general is,

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.900
so in 99% of the cases, you will integrate over r first.

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.980
So what you will do is you will look for a given theta.

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.440
What are the bounds for r to be in the region?

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.460
What is the portion of my ray that's in the given region?

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:48.040
And then you will put the bounds for theta.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.760
But conceptually, it's the same as before.

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.640
Just instead of slicing horizontally or vertically,

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.180
we slice radially.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.020
Okay. So we'll do more examples in a bit.

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:02.580
Any questions about this arbitrary normal method?

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:05.460
Yes?

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:11.040
When you say you're computing the rectangle with the biggest sign of the rectangle,

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:13.560
I'm curious when it is,

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.520
are the data set of r plus and tell the r?

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.180
Yes. So that's a very good question.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:27.860
Okay. Yes. Why do I measure the length inside instead of outside?

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.580
Oops. Which one do we want?

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:30.240
This one.

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:34.840
So here, I said this side is r delta theta.

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:37.680
I could have said, actually, r delta theta is the length here.

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:38.880
Here, it's slightly more.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.140
It's r plus delta r times delta theta.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.520
But, you know, if delta r is very small compared to r,

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.160
then that's almost the same thing.

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:47.840
And this is an approximation anyway.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.640
So I took this one because it gives me the simpler formula.

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.940
If you want, if you take the limit as delta r tends to zero,

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.440
then the two things become the same anyway.

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:02.940
Okay. The length, you know,

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:05.840
whether you put r or r plus delta r in here doesn't matter anymore.

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.620
If you imagine that, you know, this guy is infinitely small,

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:10.940
then really the length becomes the same.

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:18.480
Okay. We'll also see another proof of this formula

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.200
using changes of variables next week.

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:24.720
But, I mean, hopefully this is at least slightly convincing.

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:29.200
Okay. More questions?

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:31.900
Nope.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.900
Okay. So let's see.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.200
So we've seen how to compute double integrals.

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.240
I have to tell you what they're good for as well.

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.040
So the definition we saw yesterday,

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:53.360
and motivation was in terms of finding volumes.

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:58.280
Okay. But that's not going to be our main preoccupation

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.800
because, you know, finding volumes is fun,

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.180
but it's not all there is to life.

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:05.620
And, you know, I mean, you're doing single integrals.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.100
When you do single integrals, it's usually not to find the

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:09.460
array of some region of a plane.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:11.960
It's for something else, usually.

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:16.560
Okay. So the way we actually think of a double integral

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.100
is really as summing the values of a function,

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:20.120
all of our this region.

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:24.460
So we can use that to get information about maybe the region

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:27.400
or about the average value of a function in that region,

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:27.940
and so on.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:31.980
So let's think about various uses of double integrals.

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:43.260
So the first one that I will mention is actually something

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.400
you thought maybe you could do with a simple integral,

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.020
with a single integral.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.820
But it's useful very often to do it as a double integral.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:56.160
It's to find the array of a given region of our plane.

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:01.740
Okay. So I give you, you know, some region in the plane.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.260
And you want to know just its area.

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:11.360
So in various cases you could set this up as a single integral.

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:15.800
But often it could be useful to set it up as a double integral.

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:19.000
So how do you express the area as a double integral?

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:25.600
Well, the area of this region is the sum of the areas of all

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:29.480
the region of the region.

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:37.220
Okay. So the area of r is the double integral of r of a function

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:41.160
1. Let's.

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:48.460
So one way to think about it, if you're really still attached

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:51.360
to the idea of double integral as a volume, you know,

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:54.560
what this measures is the volume below the graph of a function 1,

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:57.860
the graph of a function 1 is just a horizontal plane at height 1.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:06.420
So what should be measuring would be the volume of a prism or with base r and height 1.

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:12.600
And the volume of that, of course, would be base times height,

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.500
so it would just be the area of r again.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.940
But we don't actually even need to think about it that way.

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:21.940
Really, what we're doing is we're summing dA over the entire region.

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:27.080
Okay. A related thing we can do.

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:33.320
So imagine that actually this is, you know, some object, some physical object.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:38.000
I mean, it's got to be a flat object because we're just dealing with things in the plane so far.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.860
But, you know, you have a flat metal plate or something.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.240
And you would like to know it's mass.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:49.760
Well, its mass is the sum of the masses of every single little piece.

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:53.900
And so you would get that by integrating the density.

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:57.820
The density for a flat object would be the area, sorry,

00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:58.940
the mass per unit area.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:12.280
Okay. So you can get the mass of a flat object.

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:18.660
With density, let's use delta for density,

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:22.480
which is the mass per unit area.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:34.900
So each little piece of your object will have a mass,

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:40.560
which will be just the density, times its area, for each small piece.

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:43.580
And you will get the total mass by summing these things.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:54.340
So the mass will be the double integral of the density times the area element.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:59.980
Now, if it has constant density, you know, if it's always the same material,

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:05.560
then of course you could just take the density out and you will get density times the total area.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.680
And if you know that it's always the same material.

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:14.060
But if actually it has varying density, maybe because it's some metallic thing,

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:17.020
but with various metals or with varying thickness or something,

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:19.900
then you can still get the mass by integrating the density.

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:26.640
So, I mean, of course looking at flat objects might be a little bit strange,

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.760
that's because we're only doing double integrals so far.

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.720
In a few weeks we'll be doing triple integrals,

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.600
and then we'll be able to do solids in space.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.700
But, you know, one thing at a time.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.680
Okay.

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:46.620
So.

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:55.380
Okay.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:02.360
Another useful application is to find the average value of some quantity in a region.

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:18.240
So what does it mean to take the average value of some function f in this region r?

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.440
Well, you know what's the average of, you know, a finite set of data.

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:26.340
For example, if I ask you to compute your average score on 18 or two problem sets,

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:29.780
you would just take the scores, add them up and divide by the number of problem sets.

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:33.480
What if there's infinitely many things?

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:36.940
Because, you know, say I ask you to find the average temperature in this room,

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:38.960
where you would have to measure the temperature everywhere,

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:43.340
and then add all of these together and divide by the number of data points.

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:48.140
But depending on how careful you are, actually there's potentially infinitely many points to look at.

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:59.880
So the mathematical way to define the average over a continuous set of data is that you actually integrate the function over the entire set of data.

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:05.220
And then you divide by the size of the sample, which is just the area of the region.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:07.260
Okay.

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:12.700
So in fact, the average of f.

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:19.940
So the notation we'll use usually for that is f with a bar on top, okay, to tell us the average f.

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:32.160
That would be, so we say it, we'll take the integral of f, and we'll divide by the area of the region.

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:38.900
Okay. You can really think of it as the sum of the values of f everywhere,

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:42.520
divided by the number of points in everywhere.

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:50.940
And so that's an average where everything is actually equally likely.

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:54.600
You know, that's a uniform average where all the points in the region,

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:57.320
all the little pieces of the region, are equally likely.

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:03.140
But maybe if you want to do say an average over some solid with variable density,

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:07.180
or if you want to somehow give more importance to certain parts than to others,

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:10.320
then you could actually do a weighted average.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.300
So what's a weighted average?

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:22.000
Well, you know, in the case of taking the average of your problem sets,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.160
if I tell you well, problems set one is worth twice as much as the others,

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:29.460
then you would count twice that score in the sum, and then you would divide,

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.340
you would count it as two, of course, when you divide.

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:38.360
So the weighted average is the sum of the values that each weighted by a certain coefficient,

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:41.260
and then you will divide by the sum of the weights.

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:48.080
So it's a bit of the same idea as when we, you know, replace a rare by some mass

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.820
that tells you how important a given piece is.

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:54.900
So we'll actually have a density.

00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:58.920
Let's call it delta again.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:03.360
That would be now, well, we'll see what we divide by.

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:11.700
But what we will take is the integral times of a function times the density times the area element.

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:15.460
Because this would correspond to the mass element,

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:21.740
telling us how to weight the various points of our region.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:26.440
And then we would divide by the total weight, which is the mass of the region.

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.300
So as defined up there.

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:32.020
Okay?

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:38.840
So, you know, if a density is uniform, then of course the density gets out, and you know,

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:42.580
you can simplify and reduce to that, if all the points are equally likely.

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:46.600
Okay, so why is that important?

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.720
Well, that's important for various applications.

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:57.720
But one that you might have seen in physics, we care about maybe where is the center of mass of a given object.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:03.300
So the center of mass is basically the point, you know, you would call that point to be, you know,

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.240
you would say that point is right in the middle of the object.

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:11.680
But of course, if the object has a very strange shape, or if somehow part of it is heavier than the rest,

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:14.440
then that takes a very different meaning.

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:22.240
So strictly speaking, the center of mass of a solid is the point where you would have to concentrate all the mass.

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:27.700
If you wanted it to behave equivalently from the point of view of mechanics,

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:30.280
if you are trying to do translations of that object.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:35.060
You know, if you were going to push that object, that would be really where, you know,

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.260
where the equivalent point of mass would lie.

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:50.440
So the other way to think about it, you know, if I have a flat object, then the center of mass is basically the point where I would need to hold it so that it's perfectly balanced.

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:54.560
You know, and of course I can do this because I'm not well, whatever.

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:58.500
But you get the feeling, I mean, the center of mass of this eraser is somewhere in the middle.

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:04.180
And so in principle, that's why I would have to put my finger for it to stay, well, and it doesn't work.

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:11.260
Okay, that's where the center of mass should be.

00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:12.620
I think it should be in the middle.

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:25.420
So, well, maybe if you don't call this free, it should call this, maybe, you know, 2A or whatever.

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:29.120
It's, it's really a special case of the average value.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:41.920
So, how do we find the center of mass of a flat object with the set of delta?

00:25:50.720 --> 00:26:04.720
Well, so if you have your object in the xy plane, then its center of mass will be at positions that are actually just the coordinates of the center of mass.

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:09.540
So, the center of mass will just be the weighted of rages of x and y on the solid.

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:16.100
Okay, so the center of mass will be at a position that I will call x bar y bar.

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:22.020
And these are really just the average values of x and of y in the solid.

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:25.080
So, just to give it from you, let's begin.

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:34.860
The main x bar would be 1 of over mass times the double integral of x times density dA.

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:51.200
And same thing with y, y bar is the weighted average of y coordinate in your region.

00:26:52.780 --> 00:27:00.460
Okay, so you see if you take a region that's symmetric and has uniform density that will just give you the center of the region.

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:10.200
But if the region has a strange shape, or if a density is not homogeneous, if parts of it are heavier, then, you know, you will get whatever weighted average will be.

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:19.340
And that would be the point where this thing would be balanced if you were trying to, you know, balance it on a pole or on your finger.

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:24.760
Okay.

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:56.820
Any questions so far?

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:00.140
No? Yes?

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:09.960
When you do that double integral over here, the inner one is y, y, y, y.

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:18.480
Oh, no, sorry. No, no. So, when you do, I mean, so here I set up this, I didn't set this up as an iterative integral yet.

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:29.360
Okay. So, here the function that I'm integrating is x times delta, where delta, you know, the density will be given to me maybe as a function of x and y.

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:37.160
And then I will integrate this dA. And dA could mean dx dy, it could mean dy dx, it could mean rdrd theta.

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:42.060
I will choose how to set it up depending maybe on the shape of the region.

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:47.360
You know, if my solid is actually just, you know, going to be round, then I might want to use polar coordinates.

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:55.500
If it's a square, I might want to use xy coordinates. If it's more complicated, well, I will choose depending on how I feel about it.

00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:00.820
Yes? Yes?

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:12.300
Yes. So, delta is the density. It's in general, it's a function of x and y. If you imagine that your solid, you know, is not homogeneous, then its density will depend on which piece of it you're looking at.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:22.940
Of course, to compute this, you need to know the density. If you have a problem asking you to find the center of mass of something and you have no information about the density, assume it's uniform.

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:27.960
Take the density to be a constant. Even take it to be a one, that's even easier if you want.

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:35.940
It's a general fact of math. We don't care about units. So, if density is constant, we might as well take it to be one.

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:39.360
That just means that our mass unit becomes the area unit.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:41.360
Yes?

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:51.360
The area of origin in general of the central mass, we're using x to y coordinates. If we wanted to use polar coordinates, we would just search for a bigger space.

00:29:51.860 --> 00:30:00.600
That's a good question. No, I don't think we could actually find the center of mass in polar coordinates by finding the average of r or the average of theta.

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:07.600
For example, take a disk center that the origin. Well, you know that the center of mass should be at the origin.

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:14.620
But the average of r is certainly not zero because r is positive everywhere. So that doesn't work.

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:20.820
You cannot get the polar coordinates of the center of mass just by taking the average of r and the average of theta.

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:25.920
But what's the average of theta? If you take theta to go from zero to two pi, the average theta will be pi.

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:31.620
If you take it to go from minus pi to pi, the average theta will be zero. So there's a problem there.

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:33.840
So that actually just doesn't work.

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:43.620
So we really have to compute x bar and y bar. But still we could compute them, you know, we could set this up and then switch to polar coordinates to evaluate this integral.

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:46.460
But we'd still be computing the average values of x and y.

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:51.760
Okay.

00:30:56.700 --> 00:31:03.380
So the next thing, so we're basically re-exploring, you know, mechanics and motion of solids here.

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:06.240
So the next thing is moment of inertia.

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:17.860
So just to remind you, or in case you somehow haven't seen it in physics yet.

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:24.800
So the moment of inertia is basically to rotation of a solid, what the mass is to translation.

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:30.440
Okay. In the following sense, mass, the mass of a solid is what makes it hard to push it.

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:35.200
You know, how hard it is to throw something is related to its mass.

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:40.980
How hard it is to spin something on the other hand is given by its moment of inertia.

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:56.560
Maybe I should write this down. So mass is how hard it is to impart a translation motion to a solid.

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:00.940
So I'm using fancy words to the end.

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.620
And the moment of inertia.

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:13.980
So the difference with the masses at the moment of inertia is defined about some axis.

00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:20.420
So you choose an axis, then you will try to measure how hard it is to spin your object around that axis.

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:27.140
For example, I can try to measure how hard it is to spin this sheet of paper about an axis that's in the center of it.

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:30.640
So I will try to spin it like that and see how much effort I have to make.

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:33.400
Well, for a sheet of paper, not very much, but.

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:44.600
So that would measure the same thing, but it would be rotation, motion, about that axis.

00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.720
So maybe some of you know the definition.

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:02.380
If not, I'm going to try to derive it again.

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:07.600
I'm sorry, but it won't be quite as detailed as the way you've probably seen it in physics, but you know,

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:10.420
I'm not trying to replace your physics teachers. I'm sure they're doing a great job.

00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:17.360
So what's the idea for the definition?

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.340
To find a formula for the moment of inertia.

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:21.980
So the idea is to think about kinetic energy.

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:28.200
Kinetic energy is really what, you know, when you push something or when you try to make it move,

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:30.180
you have to provide some energy to it.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:31.900
And then it has kinetic energy.

00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:37.140
And if you have a right device, then you can convert back that kinetic energy into something else.

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:46.200
So if you try to look at the kinetic energy of a point mass,

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:51.960
so you have something with mass m going at velocity V,

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:56.940
well, that will be one half of a mass times the square of the speed.

00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:00.900
Hopefully you've all seen that formula sometime before.

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:04.460
Now let's say that instead of just trying to push this mass,

00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:07.420
I'm going to make it spin around something.

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:16.500
So instead of just somewhere, maybe, you know, I will have the origin,

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:22.020
and I'm trying to actually make it go around the origin at a certain, you know,

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:23.960
in a circle, at a certain angular velocity.

00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:35.820
So for a mass m, at distance r, let's call r this distance.

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:48.540
And angular velocity, let's call the angular velocity omega.

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:50.080
I think that's what physicists call it.

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:56.420
So remember, the angular velocity is just the rate of change of the angle over time.

00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:58.760
It's d theta dt if you want.

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:02.760
Well, what's the kinetic energy now?

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:05.320
Well, first we have to find out what's the speed.

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:06.620
What's the speed?

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:12.280
Well, if we are going on a circle of radius r at angular velocity omega,

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.640
that means that in unit time, we rotate by omega,

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:17.980
and we go by a distance of r times omega.

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:26.080
So the actual speed is the radius times the angular velocity.

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:37.700
And so the kinetic energy is 1.5 mv squared, which is 1.5 mr squared omega squared.

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:46.060
And so, see, by similarity with that formula, we can think of,

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:49.920
so here, the coefficient of V squared is the mass.

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:52.760
And here we'll see the coefficient of omega squared,

00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:55.180
so this thing is the moment of inertia.

00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:58.560
That's how we define the moment of inertia.

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:18.380
Okay. Now that's only for a point mass.

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:22.460
And it's kind of fun to spin just a small ball,

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:25.120
but maybe you'd like to spin actually a larger solid

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:28.620
and try to define this moment of inertia.

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:32.900
Well, the moment of inertia of a solid will be just the sum of the moments of inertia

00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:34.640
of all the little pieces.

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:39.320
So what we'll do is we'll just cut our solid into little chunks

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:42.760
and we'll sum this thing for each little piece.

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:53.460
Okay, so for a solid width density,

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:59.820
so each little piece has mass,

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:06.480
which is the density times the amount of area,

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:07.860
this is equal actually.

00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:14.300
And the moment of inertia of a small portion of the solid will be

00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:17.700
delta m, the small mass, times r squared,

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:22.200
the square of a distance to the center, to the axis around which I'm spinning.

00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:28.220
So that means if I sum these things together,

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:32.880
well, so it has a moment of inertia,

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:44.560
delta m times r squared, which is r squared times the density times delta a.

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:47.980
And so I will be summing these things together.

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:55.180
And so the moment of inertia about the origin will be the double integral

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:58.460
of r squared times density times dA.

00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:35.000
Okay, so the final formula for the moment of inertia about the origin

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:45.460
is the double integral of a region of r squared density dA.

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:49.360
Or if you're going to do it in x-y coordinates,

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:52.320
of course r squared becomes x squared plus y squared,

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:58.320
it's the square of the distance from the origin.

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:04.080
Okay, so when you integrate this, that tells you how hard it is to spin that solid

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:05.380
about the origin.

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:08.460
So the motion that we try to do, we keep this fixed,

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:13.900
and then we just rotate around the origin.

00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:18.000
So that's a pretty bad picture, but hopefully you get what I mean.

00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:28.060
Okay, and then the rotational energy, so the name we use for that is i0.

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:41.860
And then the rotational kinetic energy is one half times this moment of inertia

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:44.380
times the square of the angular velocity.

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:50.540
So it's in this sense that this replaces the mass for rotation motions.

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:59.400
Okay, what about other kinds of rotations?

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:07.140
So in particular here we've been rotating things about just a point in the plane.

00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:11.820
What you could imagine also is instead you have your solid.

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.880
So what I've done so far is I've skewered it this way,

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:21.960
and I'm rotating around the axis.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.040
Instead I could skewer it through, say, the horizontal axis,

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:29.320
and then I could try to spin about the horizontal axis.

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:33.920
So then it would rotate in space in that direction, like that.

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:49.000
So, let's say we do rotation about the x-axis.

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:52.820
Well, the idea would still be the same.

00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:59.780
Okay, if moment of inertia for any small piece of the solid would be its mass element

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:03.560
times the square of the distance to the axis,

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:06.000
because that will be the radius of the trajectory.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:12.760
If you take this point here, it's going to go on a circle like that,

00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:14.960
center on the x-axis.

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:19.060
So the radius will just be this distance here.

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:21.540
Well, what's this distance?

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:25.200
It's just y, or maybe absolute value of y.

00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:35.100
So distance to x-axis is absolute value of y,

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:39.660
and what we actually care about is the square of the distance,

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:41.260
so that it will just be y squared.

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:50.800
So the moment of inertia about the x-axis is going to be obtained by integrating y squared.

00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:52.880
Thanks for my sentiment.

00:41:55.880 --> 00:42:00.900
Okay, it's slightly strange that I have y in the inertia about the x-axis,

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.260
but if you think about it, why tell us me how far I am from the x-axis,

00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:07.240
so how hard it will be to spin around the x-axis.

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:12.600
Okay, and I could do the same about any other axis that I want,

00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:17.060
just I would have to sum the square of the distance to the axis of rotation.

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:25.420
Okay, so maybe I should do an example.

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:27.820
Yes.

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:33.460
Oh, sorry, same thing as above, distance to the x-axis.

00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:40.480
Because that's what we care about, right, for the moment of inertia,

00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:42.980
we want the square of the distance to the axis of rotation.

00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:53.360
Okay, so let's do an example.

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:58.220
Let's try to figure out if we have just a uniform disc,

00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:01.000
how hard it is to spin it around its center.

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:07.900
Okay, so that shouldn't be very hard to figure out.

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:17.520
So let's say that we have a disc of radius a,

00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:26.700
and we want to rotate it about its center.

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:31.320
And let's say that it's a uniform density,

00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:33.640
and let's take just the density to be one,

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:36.040
so that we don't really care about the density.

00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:40.880
So what's the moment of inertia of that?

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:48.900
Well, we have to integrate over our disc, r squared times the density,

00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:50.920
which is one, times dA.

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:53.560
Okay, what's r squared?

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:56.840
So you have here to resist the urge to say,

00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:59.440
oh, the radius is just a, we know the radius is a.

00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:03.840
No, it's not a, because we're looking at rotation of,

00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:05.700
you know, any point inside this disc,

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:09.520
and when you're inside the disc, the distance to the origin is not a,

00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:12.460
it's less than a, it's actually anything between zero and a.

00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:15.380
Okay, so just you know to point out a pitfall,

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.400
r here is really a function on this disc,

00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:19.840
and we're going to integrate that function.

00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:23.000
Okay, don't plug r equals a, just yet.

00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:28.340
Okay, what coordinates do we use to compute this integral?

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:30.740
We are probably polar coordinates,

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:35.140
I mean, unless you want to repeat of what happened already with, you know, X and Y.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.620
So that will tell us we want to integrate r squared times r dr d theta.

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:46.640
And the bounds for r, well, r will go from zero to a,

00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:49.860
no matter in which direction I go from the origin,

00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:55.520
if I fix theta, r goes from zero to r equals a.

00:44:56.260 --> 00:45:01.480
The part of this ray that lives inside the disc is always from zero to a.

00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:06.120
And theta goes from, well, zero to two pi, for example.

00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:11.320
Okay, and now you can compute this integral.

00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:14.300
Well, I'll let you figure it out,

00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:17.440
but the inner integral becomes a to the four over four,

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:20.620
and the outer multiplies things by two pi,

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:23.600
so you get pi a to the four over two.

00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:25.640
No, yes.

00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:33.360
Okay, so that's how hard it is to spin this disc.

00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:38.640
Now, what about instead of spinning it about the center,

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:42.680
we decide actually to spin it about a point on the circumference?

00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:46.700
So, you know, for example, think of a Frisbee, you know,

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:48.240
Frisbee, you know, it has this frame,

00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:52.660
and so you can actually try to make it rotate around the point on the circumference.

00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:56.640
By holding it, you know, near the remains, spinning it there.

00:45:57.420 --> 00:45:59.260
How much harder is that than around the center?

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:04.040
Well, we'll try to compute now the moment of inertia about this point.

00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:06.260
So we have two options.

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:09.600
One is we keep the system of coordinates centered here,

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:13.260
but then the formula for distance to this point becomes harder.

00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:17.180
The other option, which is the one I will choose,

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.940
is to change the coordinates so that this point becomes the origin.

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:22.840
Okay, so let's do that.

00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:57.300
Okay, so about a point on the circumference,

00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:04.200
what I would have to do,

00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:11.460
maybe, is set up my origin like that.

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:16.780
You know, now I've moved the origin so that it's on the circumference of the disc,

00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:22.360
and I will again try to find the moment of inertia of this disc about the origin.

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:30.340
So it's still the double integral of r squared dA.

00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:34.740
But now I want to find out how to set up the integral.

00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:41.740
So I could try to use xy coordinates and it would work.

00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:46.300
Or I can use polar coordinates and actually it works a little bit better that way.

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:50.260
But both are doable.

00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:53.040
So let's say I do it this way.

00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:56.100
So I have to figure out how to set up my bounds.

00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:58.620
So what are the bounds for r?

00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:02.080
Well, if I fix a value of theta,

00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:06.820
so it means I chose an angle here,

00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:11.520
and now I'm shooting a ray from the origin in that direction.

00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:17.740
So I enter my region at r equals 0, but hasn't changed.

00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:21.680
The question is, where do I exit the region?

00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:24.940
So what is that distance?

00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:30.700
So maybe you've seen a recitation, maybe not.

00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:36.740
So let's see.

00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:40.220
Well, actually I should have written down the radius of the circle is a,

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:41.780
so this distance here is 2A.

00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:49.560
Okay, so if you draw this segment in here,

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:52.600
you know that here you have a right angle.

00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:55.300
So you have a right triangle.

00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:58.500
The hypotenuse here has length 2A.

00:48:58.940 --> 00:48:59.880
This angle is theta.

00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:04.780
Well, this length is 2A cosine theta.

00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:13.740
Okay, so the polar coordinates equation of this circle passing

00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:18.260
through the origin is r equals 2A cosine theta.

00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:27.040
So r will go from 0 to 2A cosine theta.

00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:30.300
Okay, that's the distance.

00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:34.980
Now what are the bounds for theta?

00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:40.740
It's not quite 0 to 2A because actually you see in this direction,

00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:43.660
if I shoot a ray in this direction, I will never meet my region.

00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:46.720
So I have to actually think a bit more.

00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:50.940
Well, the directions in which I will actually hit my circle

00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:54.200
are all the directions in the right half of a plane.

00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:58.760
Okay, I mean, of course I should very close to the axis.

00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:01.760
You might think, oh, I won't be in there, but actually that's not true

00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:04.460
because here the circle is tangent to the axis.

00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:06.620
So in no matter which direction I take,

00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:08.900
I will still have a little tiny piece.

00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:13.840
So the angle actually goes from minus pi over 2 to pi over 2.

00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:19.760
So now if you compute that, you will get,

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:25.480
well, the inner integral will be r to the 4 over 4

00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:27.780
between 0 and 2A cosine theta,

00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:34.220
which will turn out to be 4A to the 4 cosine to the 4 theta.

00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:40.960
And now you will integrate that from minus pi over 2 to pi over 2.

00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:48.240
And well, that's again the evil integral that we had yesterday.

00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:51.180
So either we remember the method from yesterday,

00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:54.080
or we remember from yesterday that actually there's formulas

00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:56.020
in the notes to help you.

00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:58.860
So on homework, you can use this formula in the notes

00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:00.300
at the beginning of section 3B.

00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:07.480
There's formulas for these particular kinds of integrals.

00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:12.280
And that will end up being three halves of pi a to the 4.

00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:14.520
So in case you wanted to know,

00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:16.840
it's three times harder to spin a frisbee

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:19.320
about a point in circumference than around the center.

00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:23.200
See, we got three times the moment of inertia about the center.

00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:27.560
Okay, that's it. Have a nice weekend.
