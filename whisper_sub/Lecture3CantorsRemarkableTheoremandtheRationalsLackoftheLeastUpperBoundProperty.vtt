00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.620
Okay, so here we are again.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.660
So I'm going to finish real quick proof of a theorem that I stated last time due to

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.370
the end-tour, so let me recall the setting.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:37.310
So last time we were finishing up what I have to say about cardinality, which remember

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.050
is a notion of size of sets.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:01:00.910
And at the end, for a given set A, then we defined the power set of A to be the set

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.410
of all subsets.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.970
And last time, for example, we did several of them, or looked at a few different power

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:12.390
sets.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.370
Simplest example is that the power set of the empty set is the set containing the empty

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.830
set.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.930
And in particular, the power set has one more element than the empty set.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.410
The empty set has no elements.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.610
The power set of the empty set has one element, namely the empty set.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:51.430
And we are looking at this to answer a question which I posed at the end of last class.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:02:00.070
Namely, all the sets we saw from the integers to even numbers, to rational numbers, which

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:07.010
is on the assignment, all have the same cardinality as the natural numbers.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.810
And that's what we call the countably infinite.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:20.410
And so a question would be, is there any set that is bigger than in cardinality than the

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.990
natural numbers?

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.450
Is there any set that's uncountable?

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.810
And so this theorem, due to Cantor, answers that and more.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:44.290
And it says the following, if A is any set, so if A is a set, then the cardinality of

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:51.990
A is strictly smaller than the cardinality of the power set of A. And as a consequence,

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:21.970
so consequence is that the natural numbers have smaller size than the power set of the

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:28.250
power set of A. And so on, there are an infinity of infinity.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.710
There is an infinite size.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:34.970
That's a consequence.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:41.390
I don't know if that's...

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.850
Okay.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.110
So, let's prove this theorem.

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.550
And it's extremely clever and a bit mind-boggling.

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:12.830
So, first, let me prove that A has cardinality less than or equal to the cardinality of the power

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:20.910
set of A. So, let A be a set.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.110
First, going to show that the cardinality of A is less than or equal to the cardinality

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:36.090
of the power set of A. So, we need to find an injection, a 1 to 1 map from A into the power set

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:46.330
of A. And the simplest one to choose is one that takes an element of A to the set containing just that element.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:05:00.870
So, define F from A into the power set of A by the function that takes X.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:10.990
And this should spit out a subset of A. So, this will be the subset that consists solely of X.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.710
Okay. And this is clearly 1 to 1.

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:23.510
Now, prove this right now. Then, we need to prove that if F of X equals F of Y, then X equals Y.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:37.050
But this is sort of clear from the definition. Then, if F of X equals F of Y, this means this set containing X.

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:45.550
This is by the definition of how we've defined little F. Means that the set containing X is equal to the set containing Y.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:51.150
But this means X equals Y. They both contain one element.

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:59.650
Two sets are equal. If only if that element is a one set as an element of the other, that just means X equals Y in this setting.

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:17.510
Thus, F is 1 to 1, which since we found an injective map from A to the power set of A, this means.

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:30.670
Okay. So, now we want to show that they cannot have the same cardinality.

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:48.790
We now show that A does not have the same cardinality as the power set of A.

00:06:48.790 --> 00:07:02.350
And these two statements are what is meant when we write down, we call the definition of the cardinality of A or size of A being smaller than the cardinality of the power set of A.

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:10.710
Okay. So, we're going to do this by a proof by contradiction.

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:21.310
So, proof by contradiction.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:32.150
So, that means we're going to assume that this does not hold and arrive at a false statement.

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:45.550
Okay. So, assume that they do have the same cardinality.

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:51.790
So, this is our initial assumption. We're going to derive a false statement from this assumption.

00:07:52.610 --> 00:08:04.070
And the only way to arrive at a false statement from a given assumption in a logically consistent fashion is that the original statement, namely this, is false.

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:08.550
Okay. In other words, the thing we want to show is true.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:29.410
Okay. So, let's assume they have the same cardinality. What does that mean? Then there exists a bijective function,

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:41.970
g going from A to the power set of A. Remember, a bijective function means that g is 1 to 1 and on 2.

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:53.690
Okay. 1 to 1, meaning different things of A gets mapped to different things of the power set. On 2 means everything in the power set gets mapped on 2 from A.

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:59.310
All right. So, really, the fact that it's a surjective is the only thing I'm going to use.

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:08.310
And I'm going to define kind of a weird set. And we're going to look at this set.

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:33.210
So, define a set B. And this is a subset of A. By B is the set of all x's in A, such that x is not in f of x.

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:48.570
All right. This should be g. Okay. So, remember, g maps from A to the power set. So, for any given x in A, g of x is a subset of A.

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:57.430
So, the condition to be in B is that this element x is not in the image of itself by g.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:09.390
Okay. And B could be empty. All right. It could be there could be no x's in A that satisfy this. But it's just a subset of A.

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:18.050
All right. I mean, simply by definition, we're just looking at elements in A that satisfy a certain condition.

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:33.970
So, since it's a subset of A, this means that it's a element of the power set of A. This is just how the power set is defined.

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:45.330
Remember, it's all subsets of A. So, B is an element of the power set of A. Therefore, something gets mapped to B under this map.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:11:12.810
Okay. So, since g is surjective, there exists B in capital A such that g of little B equals capital B.

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:24.970
Okay. So, this just follows from the fact that g is a surjection, meaning everything in here must get mapped to by some element in A.

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:37.110
All right. But now, let's take a look at this B guy. There are two cases.

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:59.410
This is either B is in G of B or B is not in G of B. So, B is in G of B.

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:21.910
If B is in G of B, remember, this is equal to capital B. All right. By definition. And to B in capital B means that X is not in G of X, but, let me just write this again.

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:39.310
This means B is in B, which means B is not in G of B. So, we started off with B in G of B and ended with B is not in G of B.

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:54.530
Okay. So, we arrive at a false statement in this case. Then there's one other case, B is not in G of B. Okay.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:13:15.830
Then if B is not in G of B, this immediately implies by the definition of capital B, meaning G of B is in capital B.

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:43.530
So, let me write it this way. So, if B is not in G of B, this followed then from the definition of capital B, this implies that B is in capital B.

00:13:44.710 --> 00:14:04.050
Okay. That's just from the definition of capital B. But now capital B is equal to G of little B, which is another contradiction, because we started with this and ended with this.

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:25.030
So, what I've really proven is, so let's ignore this contradiction mark here, thus we have shown that B in G of B implies B not in G of B.

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:44.170
So, we've proven the statement that B is in G of B, if and only if B is not in G of B. And this is a very false statement.

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:51.790
It cannot have some object being in the set, if and only if it's not in the set.

00:14:53.830 --> 00:15:09.810
So, we've arrived at a false statement, and therefore our initial assumption, which led us there, namely that the cardinality of the set A has the same cardinality as the power set of A, must have been false.

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:31.710
Okay. So, you know, this is, it feels almost like you're being hoodwinked a little bit with this proof.

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:59.710
But kind of to, I don't know, give you some sort of cling or connection back to reality, what's kind of underlying this argument or what's

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:18.590
one way of understanding this argument is to think about, so in some sense what this argument does is make you talk about being in B while having to also reference B itself.

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:31.870
Okay. And maybe this seems a bit wild because this is a math course, but you can do this statement just in the English language.

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:45.310
If I am to tell you that I am a liar, then if that statement is true, then what I just said, namely that I am a liar, is false, which means I'm not a liar.

00:16:47.110 --> 00:17:06.810
Therefore, I am a liar, implies I'm not a liar, and vice versa, just if I say I am a liar, and that statement is false, meaning I'm not a liar, then that statement is true, which implies I am a liar.

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:20.770
So of course I would not lie to you, I would just give you alternative facts, but that statement is kind of what's underlying this argument.

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:40.990
True or false?

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:54.810
Okay, that's kind of the connection to these two things.

00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:03.250
Lusely is, or at least the logic is contained in trying to verify this statement.

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:10.950
Okay. So that's all I'm going to say about cardinality.

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:14.130
We're going to move on to the real numbers now.

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:38.310
And so this is really, like I said in the previous lecture, our first real goal of the class is to describe R.

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:55.370
Namely, what exactly is the set of real numbers? What characterizes the set of real numbers?

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:13.050
And so let me state this as a theorem just completely ahead of time so that it's there for us, and this is kind of our goal, although we're not going to prove it, our goal is just to understand what this theorem says.

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:23.270
So this is a complete description of what R is.

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:48.730
There exists a unique ordered field containing q with the least upper bound.

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:11.330
Property, which we denote by R, set of real numbers.

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:23.690
Okay, so as you sit there and listen to this, you shouldn't have, maybe you do, but you really shouldn't expect to have any idea about what this theorem says, what all these words mean.

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:34.030
So our goal for this lecture is to make sense of these words.

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:41.030
So the rest you should understand.

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:51.250
So our goal for this lecture is to make sense of these words, ordered field, least upper bound property.

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:59.250
Okay, because these are the two defining characteristics of R.

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:04.490
And I'm not going to prove this theorem. We're just going to take it as a given.

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:15.730
We could prove this theorem, but it takes quite a bit of time, and I'd rather start studying properties of R than building R.

00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:39.750
This is not so uncommon in math that one is not especially interested in the proof of actually why certain things exist, but we are definitely interested in the properties of that thing once we know it exists.

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:47.990
So, okay, so let's get started on making sense of what this theorem says.

00:21:50.090 --> 00:22:02.750
Let's start off with order stuff. This says ordered field, least upper bound property. Let's start off with, what do I mean by order?

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:11.070
We've kind of seen that just a little bit already when we talked about the natural numbers and this well ordering property of the natural numbers.

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:18.230
But I was just using words to label a certain property of the natural numbers I didn't give.

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:21.890
I didn't say they meant anything specifically. It was just a label for that.

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:25.170
But when I say order now, this will definitely mean something.

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:36.770
Ordered sets and fields.

00:22:41.410 --> 00:23:01.970
So, definition, ordered set is a set S with

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:10.470
a relation which we label with this less than symbol.

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:17.470
And this relation satisfies two properties.

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:23.850
One is you can always check whether two elements are bigger than each other or equal.

00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:39.570
So, for all x, y and s, either x equals y, x is less than y or that's just restating y is less than x.

00:23:47.310 --> 00:24:00.010
And if x is less than y is less than z, then x is less than z.

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:15.030
So, an ordered set is just a set with some relation which has two properties namely that for any two elements in the set, I can compare the two that's basically what this says.

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:22.670
And I have this transitive property that if x is less than y and y is less than z, then x is less than z.

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:40.810
Okay? And so, as I said before, whenever you have some sort of mildly interesting definition, you should definitely try to come up with examples and non-examples.

00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:56.510
So, what's the simplest example of an ordered set? Well, the natural numbers which we discussed earlier, but also the integers where I have to define what this relation means.

00:24:56.510 --> 00:25:02.350
We say m is less than n.

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:14.770
This m is less than m if m minus m is a natural number.

00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:22.350
So, this is how we define our order. So, n is bigger than m if n minus m is a natural number.

00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:24.670
Okay?

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:34.970
So, and you can check that this is just the usual ordering on z and that satisfies these two properties.

00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:59.610
The standard order on q, namely that we'll say q is less than r if there exists natural numbers m in such that r minus q equals m over n.

00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:03.870
Okay?

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:29.310
So, these are just the usual orders of the integers and rational numbers that you're used to and that you know I'm just writing out exactly how one would define this order and you can check just using this definition of these orders that these orders satisfy one and two.

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:31.570
Okay?

00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:54.330
Now, a simple non-example, which is a, I guess you could call it, it's a relation which satisfies two but not one is the following.

00:26:54.330 --> 00:27:23.310
So, let's take our set s to be concrete, the power set of the natural numbers and we define a relation a less than b by a less than b.

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:27.290
So, let's say if a is a subset of b.

00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:29.570
Okay?

00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:43.130
So, I'm just defining a relation on the power set a less than b if a is a subset of b and maybe I shouldn't even use less than because this makes you think that it's automatically in order.

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:46.350
So, let's make it a script looking less than.

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:51.630
Then this relation is not an order though.

00:27:51.950 --> 00:28:05.170
It's a, so I keep saying order so we usually refer to this relation as an order.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:10.270
Okay?

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:14.110
So, it's clear that it satisfies two.

00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:38.090
Why? Because a is a subset of b, b is a subset of c, then a is a subset of c, i.e. a, less than c.

00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:45.550
Okay? Just follows from the definition of what it means to be a subset of the other.

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:53.810
If a is a subset of b, that means every element of a is an element of b. If b is an element of c, that means every element of b is an element of c.

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:57.030
And therefore, every element of a is an element of c.

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:04.450
So, this relation satisfies this second transitive property.

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:07.590
But it doesn't satisfy the first.

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:26.550
I cannot always measure if one thing is bigger than the other because, why is this?

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:38.010
For example, the set containing zero does not equal the set containing one.

00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:52.430
But neither of these things hold.

00:29:53.650 --> 00:30:04.950
Okay? So, for something to be an order or a set to be an ordered set, it has to have this property that I can always compare two elements of this set.

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:22.970
And for this relation, which seems like it could be an order, it satisfies the second property. It does not satisfy the first property because I cannot always compare two subsets of the natural numbers by saying one is a subset of the other.

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:32.350
Okay? So, we just solved that. We have two sets which are not equal, but one is not bigger than the other.

00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:34.250
Okay?

00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:52.250
Okay?

00:30:52.250 --> 00:31:06.330
And so, one more example, which again, I will leave for you to check that it does satisfy conditions one and two just based on how it's defined.

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:24.950
For example, this is the dictionary ordering of q Cartesian product q. I think I wrote this down.

00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:44.310
I mean, you should know what the Cartesian product is of two things, but let me just recall that I have two sets. The Cartesian product of A and B, this is the set of all ordered pairs of elements from those sets.

00:31:46.590 --> 00:32:13.110
Okay? So, the dictionary ordering of q is what? So, I need to define this relation, which I claim is an order. So, we'll say that A, B is less than qR, if one of two things happens.

00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:30.990
If either A is less than q or A equals q and B is less than r.

00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:45.210
Okay? So, dictionary ordering or alphabetical ordering of q, right? You just check, see which is smaller first. If they're both equal, then you check the next letter and see which one's smaller there.

00:32:45.210 --> 00:33:05.530
Okay? So, then this relation that I've defined here is an order on q cross q, making it an ordered set.

00:33:16.690 --> 00:33:24.450
Okay? Okay. So, this is what an ordered set is, we'll get to an ordered field in just a second.

00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:34.070
But now, let's make sense, or let me define what I mean by this least upper bound property, and this is really what sets r apart from q.

00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:45.950
So, we'll see in a minute that both r and q are ordered fields, so that's not what separates r from q, the rational numbers.

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:50.930
But what does separate r from q is the second property, least upper bound property.

00:33:51.210 --> 00:34:00.950
So, if I said that there, if I removed that property and just said there exists a unique ordered field containing q, that would just be q.

00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:13.310
All right? We don't need to add anything to it, but it's the second property, this least upper bound property, that really separates r from q.

00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:24.710
Okay? So, to define this, I need to define what a least upper bound is.

00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:43.190
So, and this is all in the setting of an ordered set, let s be an ordered set, and let e be a subset of s.

00:34:43.190 --> 00:35:11.330
So, I'm going to make a series of definitions here. First, if there exists an element of s, so not the set necessarily the set I'm looking at, the subset I'm looking at, such that for all x and e, x is less than or equal to b.

00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:19.750
So, here I have this order less than or equal to means just what it means in English, either x is less than b or x is equal to b.

00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:40.750
And the same thing with bigger than or equal to, and so on, but just keep in mind that, you know, this order is a, or this ordered set as a general ordered set, you know, you could think of it as the dictionary ordering on q, cross q.

00:35:40.750 --> 00:36:08.950
So, if there exists a b such that for all x and e, x is less than or equal to b, then we say that e is bounded above, and this element of b is an upper bound.

00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:14.130
For e.

00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:33.710
So, if I can find some element of my set, bigger than everything in this set e, I say e is bounded above, and will be as an upper bound.

00:36:33.710 --> 00:37:01.070
I also have lower bounds. If there exists a b and s such that for all x and e, b is smaller than or equal to everything in e, so b is less than or equal to x, then we say e is bounded below.

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:20.990
And b is a lower bound for e.

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:26.330
So, b sits below everything in e.

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:53.910
Okay. Now, we call an element in s the least.

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:09.550
Up or bound. For e, if it satisfies two conditions.

00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:20.130
One is, well, if it's an up, least upper bound, it should at least be an upper bound.

00:38:28.770 --> 00:38:36.170
b is an upper bound for b, and it should be, in some sense, the least of all upper bound.

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:43.350
So, if I take any other upper bound, b sub zero should sit below that one.

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:11.910
Okay. So, an element is the least upper bound for set e, if it's an upper bound, and it's the least among all other upper bounds.

00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:33.490
It sits below every other upper bound. And in this case, we also say b not is the supremum of e.

00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:48.010
And we write b not equals sub e. Now, this was having to deal with upper bounds.

00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:57.270
We can also deal with lower bounds, or we also have a definition corresponding to lower bounds for what would be the greatest lower bound.

00:39:57.270 --> 00:40:17.110
So, we call an element of s the greatest lower bound for e.

00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:36.250
b, if two conditions hold, which is kind of similar to the conditions we had for least upper bound except now for lower bounds, b zero is a lower bound for e.

00:40:37.330 --> 00:41:01.230
And it is the greatest of all lower bounds, if b is any lower bound for e, then b is less than or equal to b zero.

00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:18.970
Okay. And so, there's some let name attached to least upper bound. So, there's a let name attached to the greatest lower bound, which we call the infimum.

00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:38.290
We also call b zero, the infimum of e, and we write b zero equals infe.

00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:53.250
So, we have a small, interesting and complex definition, which means we should look at some examples to get a feel for it.

00:41:54.250 --> 00:42:11.070
Okay, so let's look at some simple examples. So, let's take our big ordered set to be z, and let's take our set e to be minus one zero and two.

00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:32.210
Okay. So, what about this guy? What is the supremum? What is the infimum?

00:42:34.930 --> 00:42:55.710
So, you know, really if I'm going to prove or if I'm going to make a statement, something is equal to the supremum or something is equal to the infimum, I should actually give a proof of that, meaning if I say something's the infimum or something is the supremum, then I need to prove that it satisfies these two conditions and these two conditions.

00:42:55.710 --> 00:43:07.530
But, I'm just going over examples, so I will not give a full proof of that. This is just to get some intuition going.

00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:24.930
So, now, first off, what would be an upper bound for e? Well, three, four, five, two is an upper bound because two is bigger than or equal to everything in the set.

00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:45.970
So, two, three, four, five, these are all upper bounds for this set e. But what is the supremum, meaning the least upper bound? Well, that would be two.

00:43:46.570 --> 00:43:52.050
If I take anything less than two, that's not an upper bound because there's something in the set bigger than that.

00:43:54.730 --> 00:44:03.390
And if I take anything bigger than that, then this is going to be bigger than two, but two is still an upper bound.

00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:19.070
So, two is the least upper bound. Now, what about lower bounds? Well, lower bound would be minus one because minus one is bigger than is less than or equal to everything in the set.

00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:34.950
But then, so would be minus two, minus three, and so on. But the smallest, I mean the greatest lower bound would be minus one.

00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:47.170
Okay. Now, let's do another example.

00:44:55.150 --> 00:45:11.790
Let's now look at S, the rational numbers. And let's take e to be the set of rational numbers such that

00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:34.270
zero is bigger than or equal to, I mean, q is between zero and one, inclusive. Okay. So then what are some upper bounds? Well, everything in e is less than or equal to one.

00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:56.570
So, one is also a perfectly good upper bound. Three halves, five ports, six fifths, seven sixths, anything bigger than or equal to one is also an upper bound for this set.

00:45:56.570 --> 00:46:20.570
And the least upper bound would be one. Okay. So, if I were to try to draw q, so, or the set, let's not do that.

00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:44.270
Now, I know you usually draw this line as for the real number of line, but let's imagine it's q. So, everything bigger than or equal to one sits above everything in e. So, everything bigger than or equal to one is an upper bound and the least upper bound is one.

00:46:45.330 --> 00:47:05.130
What are some lower bounds? Well, everything in this set is bigger than or equal to zero. So, zero is a lower bound. So, is minus a half, minus a third, minus a fourth, minus a fifth, and so on.

00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:20.070
But, anything less than or equal to zero is a lower bound. Nothing, a bigger than zero can be a lower bound because I can always find some, so this is not a proof, but this is some explanation.

00:47:24.370 --> 00:47:47.070
Maybe I should have also said this for the upper bound statement, but anything bigger than zero is not a lower bound because what if I take some number, call it R, bigger than zero.

00:47:47.070 --> 00:47:59.470
And say, less than one, then R cannot be a lower bound because I can find something in e less than R, namely R over two.

00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:13.410
So, therefore, and we'll do, we're going to do some proofs where we actually have to get our hands dirty and prove something is in FEMA more the supreme.

00:48:14.330 --> 00:48:23.230
So, you'll see how that works, but for now, let's just go off of intuition. The infimum of this set is zero.

00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:40.130
Okay? Now, both of these examples so far have this property that both the soup and the inf belong to the set e that I'm looking at.

00:48:40.130 --> 00:48:54.230
But this is not necessarily always the case, so I could change this slightly. So, our universe, the ordered set we're looking at, looking in is still q.

00:48:55.230 --> 00:49:09.590
And the subset e is now, let's say, q is bigger than zero and less than one.

00:49:16.050 --> 00:49:29.010
Then, soup of e is still going to be one, but this is not an element of this set e. It's of course an element of s, this universe we're in, but it's not an element of the set e.

00:49:36.530 --> 00:49:41.030
And likewise, the infimum is still zero, but it's not an element of e.

00:49:42.110 --> 00:49:52.890
So, there are situations where you have a set, a subset of an ordered set, which has an infimum and supremum, which do not exist in this smaller set you're looking at.

00:49:52.890 --> 00:50:01.310
Whether or not the supremum or infimum exist in the universe that you're looking at in the bigger set is an entirely different issue.

00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:09.290
In fact, that's the next issue we're going to talk about.

00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:19.650
Okay, so let me just reiterate what we saw a minute ago.

00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:29.430
So, we can be in some ordered set, z or q, and the set, the smaller set, which we're taking the infim soup.

00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:40.230
And it could belong to the smaller set, for example, in this case, one in zero were in the set e, or not.

00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:52.230
You know, there is this case where neither of them were in e. And of course, if I put less than or equal to here, then I would have the inf in e and the soup not in e and then vice versa.

00:50:53.190 --> 00:51:01.050
Infs and soups of these sets don't necessarily need to belong to that set you're looking at.

00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:06.070
But they at least existed in the big set, q.

00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:30.330
Now, big ordered sets, so this ordered set that has this property that the inf and soup of bounded above and below sets exist in the bigger set always is what we call an ordered set with the least upper bound property.

00:51:36.390 --> 00:52:03.390
So, definition ordered set s as the least property.

00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:29.090
If every subset of s, which is non-empty, and bounded above,

00:52:29.090 --> 00:52:48.950
as a supremum in s.

00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:58.850
So, a set has the least upper bound property if every non-empty bounded set has a supremum.

00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:24.310
And so, you know, we could come up with simple examples of sets that do have the least upper bound property, for example, let's take s to be, I mean, this is kind of the simplest one, s with a single element.

00:53:25.210 --> 00:53:26.190
Let's say zero.

00:53:28.770 --> 00:53:35.370
Here, you know, there's no order to put on it. I mean, every element in here is equal to itself.

00:53:36.270 --> 00:53:45.750
And therefore, every non-empty subset of s is just the whole set, and the supremum would then be that one element.

00:53:46.350 --> 00:53:52.290
So, this is kind of the silliest one you could do.

00:53:56.170 --> 00:54:09.730
Let's say, you could have two elements, and then if e is a subset of s, e is one of four guys.

00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:17.190
If e is a non-empty subset of s here, the order is one, zero is less than one.

00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:24.910
If e is equal to zero, then soupy equals zero.

00:54:25.530 --> 00:54:30.870
If e is equal to one, soupy equals one.

00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:40.350
And if e is equal to zero, one, this implies soupy equals one.

00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:43.930
So, this is ns. This is ns. This is ns.

00:54:44.370 --> 00:54:51.550
Okay? So, every subset of s, which is non-empty, has a supremum in s.

00:54:51.550 --> 00:55:01.070
Okay? So, you know, these are not the most interesting examples of sets with this least upper bound property.

00:55:04.730 --> 00:55:21.530
So, for example, maybe a more interesting one would be if I take s to be, let's say, I'm going to put dots here, minus three, minus two, minus two.

00:55:22.030 --> 00:55:24.130
So, let me just write it this way.

00:55:24.490 --> 00:55:33.230
Minus one, minus two, minus three, minus four, and so on, with the usual ordering coming from the integers.

00:55:34.070 --> 00:55:40.190
So, minus two is less than minus one, minus three is less than minus two, and so on.

00:55:40.190 --> 00:55:44.250
I claim this set does have the least upper bound property.

00:55:45.110 --> 00:55:59.050
Why? Because if e is a subset of s, e, non-empty, in fact.

00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:08.690
So, both of these, you know, this was always bounded above, because there's only two elements, and you can choose the biggest one, one.

00:56:09.690 --> 00:56:16.690
Every subset of s is also bounded above by minus one, so every subset of s is automatically bounded above.

00:56:17.490 --> 00:56:22.610
So, I just need to check that every non-empty set has a supremum in s.

00:56:23.610 --> 00:56:31.010
If e is a subset of s and is non-empty, then let me look at the set minus e.

00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:35.370
I'm just, this is a label, this is not meant to mean anything always.

00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:41.450
I'm just, this is a label, which is the set of elements minus x.

00:56:43.730 --> 00:56:48.270
So, I take all my elements in e, which is a subset of the negative integers.

00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:52.690
I take their minuses. This is now a subset of natural numbers.

00:56:52.690 --> 00:57:22.170
And since, by the well-ordering property of the natural numbers, there exists an element in minus e, such that it sits below everything in minus e.

00:57:26.370 --> 00:57:41.430
For all x in e, which means that for all x in e, x is less than or equal to minus m.

00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:50.090
And I'll let you think about this just for a minute.

00:57:51.610 --> 00:58:02.890
But, so m is in, number m is in minus e, therefore, minus m is in e.

00:58:07.310 --> 00:58:18.510
And m less than or equal to minus x for all x in e implies that for all x in e, x is less than or equal to minus m.

00:58:19.930 --> 00:58:25.250
And therefore, I found an element actually in the set, capital E, that's bigger than or equal to everything in the set.

00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:39.090
But, you can convince yourself or write down a formal proof of E like that this implies that minus m is therefore the supremum.

00:58:54.650 --> 00:59:05.990
And so, kind of using this trickery of going from one set that's bounded above to a different set.

00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:31.550
And, kind of a subset of the natural numbers, you can also show, for example, z is as the least upper bound property, which I'm going to now shorten, because it's a lot of things to write.

00:59:32.330 --> 00:59:35.950
LUBP, least upper bound property. The integers also have this property.

00:59:38.270 --> 00:59:43.590
But, the integers are not all that interesting again, because I cannot divide by an integer and stay in the set.

00:59:47.890 --> 00:59:55.170
For what we want to do, we want to be able to add, multiply, subtract and divide.

00:59:56.310 --> 01:00:01.790
And we can't do that in the integers. We can do that in the rational numbers.

01:00:01.790 --> 01:00:15.170
However, q does not have this property.

01:00:17.610 --> 01:00:27.810
And we're going to prove this. This is what we're going to prove in a couple of theorems here.

01:00:28.530 --> 01:00:30.950
But, let me just put this out in front.

01:00:41.890 --> 01:00:44.390
q does not have the least upper bound property.

01:00:47.410 --> 01:01:11.830
And, where does this come from? This comes from the simple fact, which, you know, if you believe your, I don't want to call it Greek mythology, but maybe it's Greek mythology, strictly speaking, that some young guy discovered that the square root of two is not a rational number.

01:01:11.830 --> 01:01:26.170
And then he got thrown off a cliff. That's who we have to think for showing us that q is not perfect, that it does have this algebraic property, which I just referenced.

01:01:26.170 --> 01:01:38.030
In fact, you can add some trigonoplane divide and stay within the set. But, it does not have square roots of prime numbers, but square root of two in it.

01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:55.150
And, this then manifests itself in this least upper bound property by giving an example of a set, which is bounded above, which does not have a supremum in the set q.

01:01:58.030 --> 01:02:13.390
So, basically, if e is the set of rational numbers, so I have not stated a theorem yet, but I'm just telling you what we're about to do.

01:02:13.390 --> 01:02:36.590
So, if e is the subset of rational numbers, where positive and q squared is less than two, then soup e does not exist in rational numbers.

01:02:37.970 --> 01:02:50.290
So, therefore, we would have found a set, which is bounded above, which does not have a supremum in the rational numbers, and therefore, the rational numbers do not have the least upper bound property.

01:02:51.030 --> 01:03:01.270
So, this is what we're going to do, and I'll prove a state of couple of theorems that spell all this out.

01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:13.710
So, first I'm going to prove a theorem about what the supremum of such a set would have to satisfy.

01:03:13.710 --> 01:03:30.530
So, if x is in q, so this is a statement of a theorem, if x is in q, and if x equals the supremum of the set,

01:03:41.970 --> 01:03:49.830
then x is bigger than or equal to 1, and x squared equals 2.

01:03:50.990 --> 01:04:18.670
Okay, so we're just saying, I mean, I'm not, you know, don't try to take this as necessarily contradicting what I wrote there, because that was not a statement of a theorem, yet I'm stating this theorem that if I have such a supremum in q of this set,

01:04:18.670 --> 01:04:34.490
then it would have to square and give me two. Okay, not saying such an element exists, I'm just saying if there is any element of q that is a supremum of this set, then it has to be bigger than or equal to 1, and it squares 2.

01:04:34.490 --> 01:04:51.790
So, let's give a proof of this, and because I don't want to keep writing this set again, so I'm going to use the notation so that I use in the comments, let e be the set that I'm interested in.

01:04:56.870 --> 01:05:20.550
So, this should be, and suppose we have an element of q,

01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:37.230
which is the supremum of e. So, first off, what would be one element of e? What's one rational number whose square is less than 2?

01:05:41.590 --> 01:06:04.130
So, since 1 is in e, square is less than 2, and x is the supremum of e, meaning it's an upper bound for e, it must be bigger than or equal to everything in e, in particular for 1,

01:06:06.850 --> 01:06:11.250
that implies x is bigger than or equal to 1, so that's the first part of the theorem we want to prove.

01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:31.850
So, now we're going to prove two inequalities to show that x squared is actually equal to 2. We're going to prove, so this is a common trick and analysis that if I have two things that I would like to show equal to each other,

01:06:33.150 --> 01:06:39.610
sometimes a way to show that is by showing 1 is less than or equal to that, and this is less than or equal to that.

01:06:40.650 --> 01:06:50.070
So, one side is less than or equal to the other side, and vice versa, which immediately implies that it must equal each other.

01:06:59.210 --> 01:07:06.930
So, that's what we're going to do, and we're going to now prove that x squared is bigger than or equal to 2.

01:07:09.970 --> 01:07:15.330
We'll then prove that x squared is less than or equal to 2, and therefore x squared equals 2.

01:07:16.730 --> 01:07:19.590
So, to do this, we'll do this by contradiction.

01:07:24.330 --> 01:07:36.910
So, let's assume, so everything else we've done so far is still true, but now we want to prove this statement, so we're going to assume that this statement is false.

01:07:39.970 --> 01:07:46.910
Let's assume that x squared is less than 2.

01:07:58.430 --> 01:08:10.670
So, we'll define a certain rational number, h, which it's a smaller of two rational numbers.

01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:26.970
It's going to be the smaller of 1 half, and 2 minus x squared over 2 over 2x plus 1, and let me just reiterate this is less than 1, because it's the smaller of 1 half in this number.

01:08:30.290 --> 01:08:37.290
Now, when you write a proof, as you'll see, it's going to be magic that somehow this h does something magical.

01:08:39.290 --> 01:08:41.810
That's not exactly how you come up with proofs.

01:08:41.810 --> 01:08:54.010
So, what how it comes up is you take an inequality that you want to mess with, you fiddle around with it, and you see that if h is given by something, then it breaks the inequality.

01:08:55.890 --> 01:08:59.270
Or it satisfies the inequality, whichever one you're trying to do.

01:09:04.090 --> 01:09:13.010
So, since x squared is less than 2, h is positive.

01:09:13.750 --> 01:09:18.070
It's the minimum of 1 half and this number. So, if it's a half, it's positive.

01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:20.130
If it's this one, then it's still positive.

01:09:26.670 --> 01:09:34.570
And what I'm going to prove now is that x plus h is an e. It's square is less than 2.

01:09:35.950 --> 01:09:45.150
This will give us our contradiction, because x is supposed to be an upper bound for e, and therefore x is supposed to be bigger than or equal to x plus h.

01:09:45.310 --> 01:09:51.530
But this is x plus a positive number. x plus a positive number is bigger than x.

01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:59.390
So, how do we do this? Well, we have to compute the square of this and show it's less than 2.

01:09:59.970 --> 01:10:04.730
And that's kind of where our choice of h comes from.

01:10:08.010 --> 01:10:18.690
We compute that x plus h squared, this is x squared plus 2xh plus h squared.

01:10:23.730 --> 01:10:37.910
Now, this is less than x squared plus 2xh plus h. Why? Because h times h is less than h since h is less than 1.

01:10:38.490 --> 01:10:54.630
So, this is kind of why we chose h to be less than 1, so that I can get rid of this square and somehow just have a single h floating around which I can then use to show x plus h is an e.

01:10:58.870 --> 01:11:07.710
So, when I write the string of inequalities, this thing is supposed to be equal to the next thing. This is not saying x plus h squared is equal to what I'm about to write now.

01:11:07.710 --> 01:11:25.890
So, this is equal to x squared plus 2x plus 1 times h. Now, h is the minimum of these two numbers. So, h is going to be smaller than or equal to this thing.

01:11:30.010 --> 01:11:37.890
And so, this is 2 minus x squared over 2.

01:11:41.490 --> 01:11:51.910
So, I have what I had before and then times 2 minus x squared over 2x plus 1.

01:11:53.410 --> 01:12:01.830
So, now, some magic is happening. This cancels with that and I have 2 minus x squared over 2, which is less than 2 minus x squared.

01:12:02.090 --> 01:12:12.390
So, less than x squared plus 2 minus x squared because I took a half of it equals 2.

01:12:15.530 --> 01:12:20.170
So, summarizing, we started off with x plus h squared and we showed it was less than 2.

01:12:25.950 --> 01:12:47.510
And therefore, x plus h is an e. But, if I have an element of e, let's see where we on space.

01:13:06.730 --> 01:13:16.390
But, I have an element of e, which is bigger than x.

01:13:16.390 --> 01:13:31.410
So, that implies that x is not equal to the supremum of the set. Remember, by definition, something is the supremum if it's an upper bound for the set.

01:13:32.510 --> 01:13:40.150
Something is not an upper bound if you can find something in the set bigger than b not.

01:13:40.650 --> 01:13:47.930
And this is also a good exercise to do when you come across a new definition is to try and negate it to understand it a little bit better.

01:13:47.930 --> 01:13:57.350
So, let me write here next to be as an upper bound for e. Let me write what this means actually here.

01:14:00.170 --> 01:14:10.470
Well, let me write this here. B not is not. So, what's the negation of being an upper bound?

01:14:14.130 --> 01:14:25.670
So, not an upper bound for e if there exists an x in e such that x is bigger than b not.

01:14:28.010 --> 01:14:42.930
So, we have found an element. So, going back to our proof, we have found an element of our set e which is bigger than x, which means that x is not the supremum of e, which is a contradiction to our assumption.

01:14:42.930 --> 01:14:55.110
This is, these are assumptions for the theorem. So, we're always assuming this. So, this is a contradiction.

01:14:59.950 --> 01:15:11.690
Thus, our assumption that x squared bigger than or equal to 2, I mean less than 2, which is different from our assumptions of the theorem, is false.

01:15:11.690 --> 01:15:18.810
Okay.

01:15:18.810 --> 01:15:27.450
Okay.

01:15:28.450 --> 01:15:35.210
Okay.

01:15:35.210 --> 01:15:57.710
Okay.

01:15:57.710 --> 01:16:00.330
So, now we want to prove that x squared equals 2.

01:16:05.910 --> 01:16:25.590
So, we now show x squared equals 2. Since x squared, so this is not exactly the proof, just I'm going to rewrite it a little differently so it's maybe clear that,

01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:37.590
instead of showing also x squared is less than or equal to 2, which we know the less than cannot happen. Let's just show that x squared cannot be bigger than 2.

01:16:45.730 --> 01:16:53.910
Since x squared is bigger than or equal to 2, this means either x squared equals 2, which we want to show or x squared is bigger than 2.

01:16:55.430 --> 01:17:01.610
So, let's rule out this case.

01:17:11.770 --> 01:17:21.410
Now, show that the case x squared bigger than 2 cannot hold. So, suppose otherwise, we're going to do this. This is going to be a proof by contradiction as well.

01:17:22.610 --> 01:17:32.390
I guess when I say x squared bigger than 2 cannot hold. I'm also saying x squared must be less than or equal to 2. But anyways, so let's show this cannot hold.

01:17:33.490 --> 01:17:45.550
So, we're going to do this by contradiction as well. So, we're trying to show this cannot hold. So, let's assume that it does hold.

01:17:47.370 --> 01:18:01.430
So, that's the negation of what we want to show, which is this statement that x squared greater than 2 does not hold. So, assume x squared is bigger than 2.

01:18:02.170 --> 01:18:19.750
So, what we're going to do is we're going to find an upper bound for the set e, which is strictly smaller than x. And we're going to do that next time because I think I'm about to run out of time.

01:18:21.650 --> 01:18:29.670
So, okay. So, I hate to stop the proof here. But we'll finish this in the next lecture.
