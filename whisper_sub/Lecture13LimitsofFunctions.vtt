00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.200
So, all right, so let's start talking about some math.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.860
So there was a last result I was going to prove for series, which is that if you have an

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:32.220
absolutely convergent series, then, and you rearrange it, then that series is also absolutely

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:38.040
convergent and converges to the same thing as the unarranged series. But I'm going to leave that

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:49.640
to the lecture notes and we're just going to start on a new topic. So the topic that we're now on

00:00:49.640 --> 00:01:06.140
is continuous functions. And so continuous functions, as we'll see, it's a statement about how a

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:15.100
function behaves near a point in relation to how it behaves at the point. Okay. Now what it means

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:22.480
for a function to behave near a point, that's the notion of the limit of the function, which is what

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:42.760
we'll first discuss. Okay. Now, at what points are we going to be looking at? So this is where limits

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:49.800
take place. And somehow we want to look at a function near a point, near points where there's a

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:58.040
lot of a set nearby to actually look at f at. So f is usually defined on some set s. And we want

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.580
to look at points so that there's a lot of s nearby. And we kind of already dealt with these types

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:09.560
of points when we encountered cluster points in the assignment. So this is exactly where we start

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.880
looking at limits. So this is a definition that I'll recall from the assignment.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.300
Let s be a subset of r.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.300
And x and r.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:52.800
Let me say x is a plus or point of s. If we're all delta positive, the interval x minus delta x plus delta intersect s take away x.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:04.340
It is non empty. Okay. So the new terminology not so new since we dealt with it in the assignment is

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:11.780
that of a cluster point. And another way to say this is that so an equivalent way of stating this is that

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:27.280
for all delta positive, there exists and say a y in s such that zero is bigger than x minus y is less than delta.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:39.540
Okay. So what this means is that, you know, as far as a picture goes, x is a cluster point if when

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:49.600
I ever take any kind of small interval about it, I can find some s in there other than, you know, possibly x.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:04:00.980
And this should be able to be done for every interval. So let's, let's take a look at some examples.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:12.060
Let's say we take s to be one over n in a natural number. Okay.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:15.540
And so,

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:16.040
and so,

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.240
and so,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.620
and so,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.840
and so,

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.140
and so,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.420
and so,

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.300
so,

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.620
and so,

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.840
and so,

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:55.420
so,

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.340
free to blurt it out if it comes to you.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.140
We'll just take a guess.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.380
One, so that's one possibility.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:20.080
So there has to be a lot of s near this proposed cluster

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.500
point.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.860
So here's, so let me mark out the points that we have.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:32.220
There's a zero and then a half is there and then a third, fourth, fifth, sixth, so on and so on.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.240
And so I see a guess of zero.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.880
So that's a, that's a good guess as well.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.180
So why would one maybe not be a cluster point?

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.240
Well, it's because if I draw a little interval around one,

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.800
then there's only one point in s in here and it's the proposed cluster point one.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.700
OK, so remember what we should be able to do is find in every small interval,

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.640
some of s in the interval that's not equal to the point.

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.860
OK, and we can't do that for the point one.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:17.580
But for zero, if we draw any interval around zero, there's plenty of s in the interval, not equal to zero.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.420
OK, so here.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.260
Zero is a cluster point.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.960
This and let's give a quick proof of this.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.620
So we have to verify for every delta positive.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.980
This interval zero minus delta zero plus delta intersects.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.560
Take away zero is not empty.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.900
So the delta view positive.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.580
And now here's the picture.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.100
Here's zero.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.920
Here's delta.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.160
Mine is delta.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.440
We have to show that there's some s in here.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:11.100
So we simply choose natural number n large enough so that one over n is there.

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.640
And we can always do this because of the Archimedean property of the real numbers.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.500
So let delta be positive.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:32.180
Fuse natural number n so that one over n is less than delta and it's certainly bigger than zero.

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.060
n is a natural number.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:46.580
Then one over n is n x minus delta x plus delta intersects.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.260
Take away zero.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.620
So this should have been zero.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:00.620
Which implies this set is non-empty.

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:02.820
Because it has something in it.

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:07.340
Okay.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.080
All right.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.040
Was that example okay?

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:13.820
Did you all get that all right?

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.700
Okay, so feel free to ask questions as they come up.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.220
So let's do another example.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.140
This one I will not give a proof of.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.100
We'll just kind of talk our way through it.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:41.000
Let's say s is now the open interval zero one.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:57.480
What is the set of cluster points of zero one equal to?

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:05.980
So what would be a reasonable guess or any guess?

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:17.340
So yeah, so certainly this will contain zero one, right?

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:25.560
Since so zero one everything between zero and one should be a cluster point of zero one

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.180
because there's always a lot of numbers.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.040
I mean, there's a lot of numbers between zero and one.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.400
If I draw this.

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:37.700
Zero one.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:47.340
And of everything in between zero one is certainly a cluster point.

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:48.960
What about the point one?

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.780
Is that a cluster point of this set?

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:15.980
That's a good observation that yeah, it's the soup of this set.

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:17.120
So for every.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:29.360
Right.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:29.700
So.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:40.400
You know, so for every delta positive, if I draw a little interval around one,

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:45.480
there's going to be a number less than one that's bigger than one minus delta, right?

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:53.320
The set of cluster points of the open interval zero one is the close interval zero one.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.380
Okay.

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:03.020
Now, let's do another example.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:04.800
Let's say we look at now.

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:09.100
Set of rational numbers.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:18.240
So you should again, think of cluster points as being the set of points where

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.700
there is a lot of this set nearby.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:24.760
Okay.

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:28.560
Now, what is the set of cluster points of the rational numbers?

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:42.480
Okay, so so perhaps it will contain the irrational numbers.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:44.820
So let's think about this for a little bit.

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:46.800
So for example, let's look at square root of two.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:47.620
Okay.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.320
Perfectly good rational number.

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:50.720
I mean irrational number.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.560
If I draw a little interval around square root of two,

00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:01.980
can I find a rational number in there that's not equal to square root of two?

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:12.120
Right, because we have the theorem about the density of the rational numbers, right?

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:13.380
That we have.

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:20.280
So remember that this was a theorem we proved at one point for all x,

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:24.100
y, real numbers with x less than y,

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:30.060
there exist an rational number r, such that x is less than r is less than y.

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:31.520
Right?

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.680
So we can always find a rational number here,

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:39.200
or we could have taken another rational number here.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:41.440
Yeah.

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:46.540
So for every interval we draw around square root of two, we can find a rational in there,

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:51.760
not equal to square root of two, obviously, but we can find a rational in that interval.

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:52.380
Yeah.

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:58.500
So this suggests that the set of cluster points contains the set of irrationals.

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:00.020
We're about rational numbers.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.780
Are those also cluster points?

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:07.060
Let's say I take zero.

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:10.560
Now I look at a small interval around zero.

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.880
Can I find a rational number in there other than zero?

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.700
I'm not asking like, you know, actually, give me one.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:27.260
I'm just saying, is it that does there exist a rational number in this interval other than zero?

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:31.040
By this, by this theorem, right?

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:40.420
You can also use a theorem to find a rational in this interval as well.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:44.740
So no matter if it's square root of two or any irrational number,

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:50.940
no matter if it's a rational number, everything is a cluster point.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:54.840
So the set of cluster points of rational numbers is equal to r.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.240
Okay.

00:13:58.540 --> 00:13:59.500
Is that clear?

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.980
Okay, feel free to stop me if you have any questions.

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:08.340


00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:23.000
So now let's look at, for example, s equal to just a single guy, say zero.

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:23.780


00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:30.260
Remember cluster points of a set means there's a lot of that set in your body.

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:38.900
Now I claim that this guy has no cluster points.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:45.560
Because if you think so intuitively, why is this?

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:50.420
This is because for some to be a cluster point, it has to have a lot of the set near it.

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:51.180
A lot.

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.620
And there's not a lot of set to begin with.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:55.600
There's just one element.

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:58.900
So let's see why this is the case.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:14:59.460
Okay.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:05.420
And this gives us a chance to negate the definition of cluster point, which is always a good idea.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:07.120
Okay.

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:13.820
So s equals just the singleton set zero.

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:15.100
This has no cluster points.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:17.620
And so the negation of the definition of a cluster point.

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:24.880
So x is not cluster point.

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:35.860
So s means if this is some bad delta, remember, so the definition of cluster point is for all delta.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:39.920
So negation means there exists one bad delta.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:47.580
So that x minus delta zero, x plus delta zero intersect s, take away x,

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.100
equals the empty set.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:52.880
Okay.

00:15:54.980 --> 00:16:00.140
So a picture that goes along with this is that x does not cluster point if

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:11.480
there's some interval and possibly the only s there is the point x, but nothing else.

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:12.300
Okay.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.460
Um, all right.

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:24.180
So let's use the negation of this definition to show that there are no cluster points.

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:24.940
Okay.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.680
And we have to deal with two cases.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.840
Um, we want to show.

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:36.360
x is in r.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:45.240
And x is not a cluster point.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.200
The best.

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.680
And I'll just do the case x not equal to zero.

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:55.960
Um, x equal to zero is much easier.

00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:59.300
Um, so we'll just do x not equal to zero.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.120
Let's prove this.

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:09.320
Um, and what's the, what's the idea?

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:10.920
We have to be able to find.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.600
So here's zero.

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:14.360
This is all that s is.

00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:15.560
It's just this point zero.

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:17.980
Now we have a point x.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:25.320
What would be, uh, an interval containing x that contains none of s.

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:39.200
So x here is just a some non zero number.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.700
s is what's highlighted.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:47.180
To be interval around x that doesn't contain any s.

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.740
They'll like x over two.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:04.980
Re x over two, meaning delta equals x over two, at least for this picture.

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:07.940
Yeah.

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:11.720
Okay, and that's, and that's essentially the proof.

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:16.360
So, um, choose delta zero.

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:21.840
And we'll simplify this further and suppose x is positive.

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:25.420
For x less than zero, you choose delta zero to be the absolute value of x.

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:28.220
But for this one, this is simple enough.

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:30.980
Choose delta zero to be x over two.

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:38.440
Then x minus delta zero x plus delta zero.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.280
Is equal to x over two.

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:42.980
Re x over two.

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.020
Um,

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:54.160
and since zero is not in this set,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.440
in this set lies.

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:05.960
Intersect s, take away.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:10.540
x equals empty.

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:12.540
Okay.

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:20.360
So we had to find a delta so that this interval around x doesn't contain anything from s.

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.140
And we've done that by choosing delta zero to be x over two.

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:32.060
Okay.

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:33.220
Um,

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:41.040
so, you know, I could have done it for just, uh, so I did it for just one.

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:44.100
So for a set containing just one element, um,

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.140
showed that this set has no cluster points.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:53.000
You can also show that, uh, if it has finitely many points, it has no cluster points.

00:19:53.740 --> 00:20:00.400
Um, and so therefore any finite set has no cluster points, but

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:04.180
being a cluster point has nothing to do with the cardinality.

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:09.620
So if you see the example in the nodes, which you can think about, and I'm not going to go over right here,

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:14.080
but for example, s equals z, uh, the set of integers.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.320
This has no cluster points.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:29.540
Okay.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:35.600
So, um, there are, you know, being a cluster point means where is the set clustering?

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:41.440
So it has nothing necessarily to do with the size of the set, but kind of where the set is, um,

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.460
taking up space in the real number line.

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:46.200
All right.

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:47.460
So, um,

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:47.520
um,

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:51.680
way of the definition of cluster points.

00:20:54.760 --> 00:21:03.300
Um, so let me first state the theorem that in fact, you proved, uh, in the assignment, which is,

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:12.720
that for cluster points, um, let s be a subset of r.

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:18.700
And x is a cluster point.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:27.080
The best if and only if there exists sequence,

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:38.440
x in the elements of, as takeaway x,

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:42.420
x,

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:43.920
which that x in converges to x.

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:49.900
Okay, and that was in the assignment, you proved that basically using the, uh, the squeeze there,

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.060
um, in the definition.

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:53.860
All right.

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:59.680
So with, uh, the notion of a cluster point, these are kind of the points in a set where we're going to

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:02.920
start talking about how a function behaves near a point.

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:03.700
All right.

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:07.800
Um, which is, uh, the notion of a limit of a function.

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:11.120
Which is our next definition.

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:12.180


00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:15.980
let s be a subset of r.

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:22.520
And even though I was referring to cluster points earlier as x, we're now going to switch over to c.

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:25.800
The c be,

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.540
cluster point of s.

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.580
Let f be a function from s to r.

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:40.660
All right.

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:42.200
So,

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:47.660
you say f of x converges to l.

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:55.120
As x goes to c.

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:56.920
So this is a new

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:00.740
terminology here.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.480
So here l is a real number if

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:12.020
every epsilon positive exists delta positive.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:17.460
That's that if x is in s.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:26.160
Absolute value of x minus c is bigger than zero,

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.920
less than delta, then

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:33.900
f of x minus l is less than epsilon.

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:35.080
So, um,

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:43.600
let's, uh, try and compare this definition a little bit to what happens for a sequence.

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:47.280
So for sequence, it's the sequence is getting close to l.

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:54.420
Um, as long as we go far enough out in the, in the sequence as long as we look at terms far enough out.

00:23:54.420 --> 00:24:00.540
Now, for limits of functions that going far enough out along the sequences replaced by,

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:04.880
as long as we look close enough to the point c, but not at the point c.

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.300
So, um,

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:19.980
if you like, this says that if x is near c, then, so this is just an intuitive interpretation of what this,

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:23.580
definition says if x is near c, then

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.000
f of x is near l.

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:34.960
And let me also throw in here that we're saying that x is near c,

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.360
but not equal to c.

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:44.220
Okay, for a limit, you don't look at what happens at f of c.

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:49.960
The function doesn't even need to be defined there, uh, to be able to define what a

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.280
limit is. We just care about what happens nearby.

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.480
Okay. So,

00:24:56.620 --> 00:25:01.240
you could have the picture you should have in mind is that, uh, you're c.

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:09.440
And, you know, maybe f is not even defined up to there, but there's f,

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:11.360
the graph of the function f there.

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:21.720
There's l and as long as I get very close to c,

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.520
I'll be very close to l.

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:35.420
Very close being, no, measured within some strip here.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:39.920
Okay.

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:55.380
Okay, so this is the notion of the limit of a function as we approach a cluster point of the set s,

00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:59.960
where the function f is defined. This is a little bit of notation.

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:11.420
Typically, right, uh, like we did with sequences, f of x can be referred to as to l as f of x arrow l.

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:16.120
And then I'll write as x goes to c. Maybe I won't write as x goes to c.

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:22.760
And we note this by limit of f of x equals l as well.

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:27.360
Okay.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:32.320
So, first question about limits is, are the unique?

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:35.780
And this is in fact why we

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:41.440
require that c be a cluster point of s because, um,

00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:46.260
if we didn't require c to be a cluster point of s in this definition, limits would not be unique.

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.580
In fact, you could have functions converging to

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:53.980
whatever you want because the definition would then be vacuous. But, um,

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:57.160
you know, if you don't want to think about that, that's fine.

00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:01.000
It's not a big issue, but just, uh, I'm just going to point out at one point, we're going to use

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.900
the fact that c is a cluster point to prove, uh, the following theorem. So,

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:21.340
c be a cluster point of s, which is a subset of r.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.580
And that f be a function from s to r.

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:42.660
If f of x converges to l1 is x goes to c and f of x converges to l2 as x goes to c,

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:53.100
then l1 equals l2. Okay. So, this is what I mean by, uh, uniqueness that, uh,

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:56.720
a function can only have one limit as it approaches a point c.

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:03.140
Let me get the proof. So,

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:10.060
you know, we're going to play this game again where instead of showing something is zero or

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:13.620
something is equal to something else directly, we'll give ourselves a little room and prove the

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:23.560
following. We'll instead show that, uh, all epsilon positive, l1 minus l2 is less than epsilon.

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:30.480
So, l1 and l2, these are just two fixed, uh, real numbers. If their absolute value is less than

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:37.520
epsilon for arbitrary epsilon, then this is a number which is smaller than any positive real

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:46.140
number that implies that that number is zero, so l1 equals l2. Okay. Um, why would we give ourselves a

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:50.720
little room is because in the definition, we have a small parameter there, which we hope to use.

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.260
So, um, so let's prove this.

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:57.960
The epsilon deposit.

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:06.760
So, since f of x converges to l1,

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:16.140
there exists. So, so just from the definition, um, given some small tolerance, I can find, uh,

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:28.720
a little number delta so that if I look inside this interval, I get mapped to, uh, the interval l plus

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:36.960
epsilon l minus epsilon. So, there exists a delta 1 positive such that.

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:45.540
If x is an s and I'm going to probably keep forgetting to write that, but that should be understood

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:53.380
that x is in the domain of the function f. If x minus c is less than, uh, delta 1 and bigger than zero,

00:29:55.720 --> 00:30:04.360
then f of x minus l1 is less than epsilon over two.

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:14.720
Okay. And in the same thing for, um, l2, I mean, if f of x is converging to l2, then there

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:21.080
exists a delta 2 so that I have the same statement. So instead, um, I'm just going to change this one to

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:37.840
i, i, i, i, i, and here i equals 1, 2. So, since f of x converges to each of these two numbers, l1 and l2,

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:44.700
there exists a delta 1 and a delta 2 so that if I'm within this tolerance delta of 1 or delta

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:50.060
2, then f of x minus delta 1, uh, l1 or l2 is less than epsilon over two.

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:57.820
Let delta be the minimum of these two numbers.

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:06.300
Now, since c is a

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:17.560
plus or point of x, there in fact does equal, there does exist an x in s.

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:23.900
So, such that zero is bigger than x minus c is less than delta.

00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:29.120
All right. And I'm going to use this x to compare l1 and l2.

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:38.620
Then since x is in this interval, or I should say since it's, uh,

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:49.520
so remember I have this, which means I have this inequality for i equals 1, 2.

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:53.880
I get f of x, I should say.

00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:01.460
l1 minus l2, this is equal to if I add and subtract f of x.

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:12.000
And now use the triangle inequality.

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:21.460
And use the inequality that's in green.

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:25.080
The f of x minus l1 is less than epsilon over two.

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:27.840
Uh, and same for l2, I get

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.300
equals epsilon, okay?

00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:37.600
And that's the end because remember we started off with,

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:41.440
um, the absolute value of l1 minus l2.

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:44.420
Do you have any questions about that?

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:06.600
Okay, so, uh, not the most exciting theorem in the world that, uh, you know,

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:13.800
this thing that we've defined, uh, limit is uniquely, is a unique thing for a function.

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:18.060
But, uh, let's start looking at some examples.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:28.060
And at one point we'll look at the negation of this definition.

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:32.640
So, let's suppose, so let's look at the limit.

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:39.040
This x goes to c of the function ax plus b.

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:43.580
And I claim this is equal to ac plus b.

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:51.280
Okay, so here s is, although I didn't write it out, this function ax plus b, this is, uh,

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:54.500
I'm looking at it defined on all of r.

00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:58.920
And c is a real number.

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:04.740
Okay, so we have to verify, um, this definition.

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:14.780
And since it's a, for every epsilon, there exists something.

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:19.060
At the beginning of every proof, I'll give you a few points if you can just say let epsilon be positive.

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:22.560
Um, how will we choose delta?

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:28.900
Well, you do kind of, uh, similar computations as you would if you were doing

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:33.660
epsilon m arguments for, um, sequences.

00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:36.240
So, what are we after?

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:47.380
We want to find delta so that x minus c less than delta and also bigger than zero implies

00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:55.480
f of x, which is a x plus b minus ac plus b is less than epsilon.

00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:05.700
So, uh, let's start off with this thing, play with it and see if we can find how to choose delta.

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:08.720
Remember, we don't solve this inequality.

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:16.580
We want to find how to choose delta based on, you know, estimating this thing and trying to make it less than epsilon.

00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:25.200
So, um, f of x minus ac plus b, absolute value.

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:34.540
This is equal to, if you just plug in, f of x equals a x plus b, this equals a times x minus c.

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:41.240
If equals absolute value of a times x minus c.

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:46.420
And now we're in business because the thing that we do have control over is the delta.

00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:49.960
Right. It is how big x minus c is.

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:56.220
So, this is less than absolute value of a times delta if x minus c is less than delta.

00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:05.040
And remember, the thing that we want in the end is the thing in yellow and the thing we get to

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:06.680
control is the thing in green.

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:18.800
So, uh, if I want the thing in yellow and I have the thing in green, how do I choose delta?

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:40.140
So, in the end, right, I want f of x minus ac plus b to be less than epsilon.

00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:44.620
Right now, I'm at, um, the absolute value of a times delta.

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:46.480
Delta is the thing I get to play with.

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:50.020
Two, so how do I choose it?

00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:55.440
Epsilon to be absolute value.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:07.740
Right, because if I choose delta this way, then x minus c less than delta implies that

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:17.900
just by this computation here, I would get epsilon in the end.

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:19.380
Yeah.

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:25.460
So, that's kind of the scratch work that goes into it.

00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:27.400
Again, delta is the thing you get to choose.

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:31.560
You get to, um, choose based on epsilon.

00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:41.100
And so you look at f of x minus ac plus b, you estimate it to be no bigger than, um, the absolute

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:45.340
value of a times x minus c, which is less than the absolute value of a times delta.

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:51.360
And so if you want that thing to be less than epsilon, you should choose, for example, delta to

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:53.100
be epsilon over the absolute value of a.

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:54.460
There's not a unique choice.

00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:58.240
I could have chosen delta to be epsilon over two absolute value of a.

00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:01.580
Um, but this is a choice.

00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:02.260
Okay.

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:05.860
So let epsilon be positive.

00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:14.680
Choose delta to be epsilon over absolute value of a.

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:17.960
If

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:24.340
x minus c is less than delta, then.

00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:31.400
And when you write the proof, you know, it's essentially a rehashing of the best parts of your

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:36.020
computation, and f of x minus a times c plus b.

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:41.940
This is equal to absolute value of a times x minus c.

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:50.340
So, uh, if we take f of x and subtract our proposed limit ac plus b, we get the absolute value of a times

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:55.260
absolute value of x minus c, which is less than the absolute value of a times delta,

00:38:55.780 --> 00:39:00.220
g equals epsilon, since we chose delta to be epsilon over eight.

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:08.840
Okay.

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:10.860
That's, uh, that's the proof.

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:13.040
Is there any questions?

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:33.980
Okay.

00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:34.220


00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:36.560
So let's do, uh, let's do another example.

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:48.040
Let's look at the limit as x goes to c, uh, square of the function square root of x.

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:52.020
And I'm going to show this is equal to square root of c.

00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:58.820
And here, uh, although I'm not writing it s will be for us, the domain of the square root,

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:05.080
which is, uh, the closed interval, zero infinity, not including infinity, of course, but, um,

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:08.740
and for what I'm going to do, see as positive, okay?

00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:13.580
You can also do c equal to zero, uh, but for this proof, I'm going to do c positive.

00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:18.940
All right.

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:27.140
So I have to verify this definition, which means for every delta, I mean, for every epsilon,

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:32.260
I can find a delta. So let epsilon be positive. Let's go over to our box of,

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:36.820
scribbling and scratching.

00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:43.620
So remember, our goal is to find a delta, which I can choose. So that f of x minus,

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:48.240
a square root of c in this case is less than epsilon. So if I look at

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:57.680
f of x minus square root of c, this is square root of x minus square root of c.

00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:03.020
And perhaps you remember from your days and calculus that whenever you see the difference of two

00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:12.040
square roots, it's, um, a good idea, maybe to multiply the top and bottom, or I guess multiply by

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:17.740
one in a very special way so that I get the difference of square. So this is equal to the square root of

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:27.500
x minus square root of c times square root of x plus square root of c all over square root of

00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:40.820
x plus square root of c. Okay. And so now I have, uh, on the top, I have, uh, product a minus b times

00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:47.820
a plus b. So that's the difference of squares, which gives me x minus c on top over square root of

00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:58.540
x plus square root of c. Okay. Um, and remember, this is less than the thing that we're going to

00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:03.280
choose in the end, the absolute value of x minus c is going to, is less than delta. So this is less

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:09.820
than square root of x plus square root of c. Now in the end, you have to only, you can choose delta

00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:17.620
depending only on epsilon and maybe the point c. Okay. You cannot choose it to be dependent on the

00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:25.180
point x, which is changing, right? Uh, what maybe you're tempted to do here is to then choose delta to

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:36.160
be, uh, square root of x plus square root of c times epsilon. Um, don't do that. Okay. Because delta,

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:41.560
again, only depends on the point c and the point epsilon. It cannot depend on the thing that's

00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:49.880
changing, which is x, right? This is changing. So, uh, you can't, you don't make this choice.

00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:56.940
Now, if we just do one more thing, then we'll get to something where we can choose an independent

00:42:56.940 --> 00:43:04.400
of the thing that's changing x. Um, the square root of x on the bottom is only making things smaller,

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:10.500
right? Because that's not negative. So this is less than or equal to delta over square root of c.

00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:20.640
Okay. So now in the end, I have something which is delta and depends on the point c. So,

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:25.780
and I want f of x minus square root of c to be less than epsilon. So how should I choose delta?

00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:39.700
Shout it if you know it.

00:43:53.760 --> 00:44:00.420
Right. Epsilon times square root of c. So now, uh, this will be our, our choice. So,

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:07.560
choose delta to be epsilon times square root of c.

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:18.080
Now, we have to show this delta works, which is essentially, again, just rehashing our,

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:22.820
our computation over on the right, which gave us how to choose delta than if

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:36.440
you know, the value of x minus c is less than delta f of x minus square root of c. And I'm not

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:41.920
going to write f of x, I'm going to write just square root of x. This is equal to

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:57.420
x minus c.

00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:59.660
Basically, what we did over here in the box, which is,

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:06.160
the absolute value of x minus c over square root of x plus square root of c, which is less than

00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:14.000
or equal to, if I take away the square root of x on the bottom, like we did before, which is less than

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:20.680
delta, square root of c, which equals epsilon square root of c over square root of c, which equals

00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:23.540
epsilon. So this delta works.

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:34.380
Okay, there's any questions about that example.

00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:47.160
Okay.

00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:56.300
So let's do one more example, which really illustrates what I was getting at when I was talking

00:45:56.300 --> 00:46:02.300
about the limit on the cares about what the function is doing near a point, but not at the point.

00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:12.160
So let's say we look at the function f of x given by one if x equals zero and two, if x is not

00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:22.240
equals zero. Okay, so this is, um, here's the point zero. And

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:33.000
for x not equal to zero is equal to two and x equals zero is equal to one.

00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:36.440
All right.

00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:45.720
And I claim that the limit as x goes to zero of f of x is equals two.

00:46:47.660 --> 00:47:01.400
And the thing to note is that this limit does not equal f of zero, which it did for the previous two cases.

00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:07.700
Right. If we look back at these two examples that we did a minute ago, the limit as x goes to

00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:11.620
c of both of these examples was I just plug in c to the function. Right.

00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:18.520
Okay. But for this example, that's not the case. Right. The example, the limit is not equal to the

00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:25.740
function evaluated at the point in highlighting that limits don't care about the function evaluated

00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:31.620
at the point they care about what's happening near the point. Okay. And near the point, f of x is

00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:42.440
just equal to two, identically. Okay. So I'll give you the quick proof or you can completely ignore it

00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:51.240
and just believe that the limit as x goes to zero of this function equals two. So the point is,

00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:56.640
is that for x not equal to zero, f of x is just a constant two. So let epsilon be positive.

00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:04.580
And you can choose delta to be whatever you like because f of x when x is not equal to zero is

00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:13.600
going to be equal to two, the proposed limit. Then if zero is bigger than the absolute value of x

00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:19.080
minus zero, which is just x is less than delta, then this implies x is not equal to zero.

00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:27.620
And therefore, if I look at f of x minus two, this is just two minus two equals zero,

00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:37.920
which is less than epsilon. Okay. Any questions about this example?

00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:56.980
No questions?

00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:17.800
All right. So what we'll talk about now is, so before this,

00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:26.480
section on continuous functions or at least this section on limits of functions. We had the notion of limits of sequences.

00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:34.640
And so a natural question is how do limits of functions and limits of sequences

00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:43.880
belong together interact, relate to each other I guess is the best way to raise that question.

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:57.240
And the point is is that to decide if a function has a limit it suffices to stick in sequences that converge to that point that you're looking at.

00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:00.300
And that's the content of the next theorem.

00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:02.080


00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:08.920
Let s be a subset of R.

00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:10.380
See.

00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:14.780
What's the point of.

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:17.580
S.

00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:22.740
Let f be a function from S to R.

00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:25.220
Then.

00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:37.880
The limit exists limit as x goes to c of f of x equals a number L.

00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:51.640
This is equivalent to the statement that for every sequence x of n of elements of s take away c.

00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:58.200
Such that x and converges to c.

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:01.520
We have.

00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:05.300
f of x n converges to.

00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:10.660
So again, the statement of this theorem is that.

00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:21.160
A function converges to L if and only if for every sequence I stick into the function which converges to c f of x n converges to L.

00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:22.800
Okay.

00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:23.720
So it did.

00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:32.240
Shoes or to decide if a function converges it suffices to look at see convergence of certain sequences.

00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:33.000
Okay.

00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:38.100
Okay.

00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:45.840
And you know, why is this theorem important or at least very useful it's because.

00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:49.700
With this theorem, we now get basically.

00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:54.800
Every analog of theorems we prove for sequences for free.

00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:55.500
Okay.

00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:58.240
For example, limits of stums of functions.

00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:02.980
A squeeze theorem that's.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.200
You know, can be stated for limits.

00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:08.440
A functions and so on.

00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:11.260
And I'll say a few comments about this after we prove the theorem.

00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:17.180
Alright, so let's.

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:18.460
This is a two way street.

00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:19.240
So.

00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:22.760
And I'm going to mark.

00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:26.680
The second statement in green.

00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:29.740
That way I don't have to rewrite it again.

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:31.000
So.

00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:33.220
First assume.

00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:34.900
That.

00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:38.320
Limit as x goes to c of f of x equals L.

00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:40.240
And now we want to prove the statement in green.

00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:41.660
Okay.

00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:44.760
So.

00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:47.500
Here's a here's the idea.

00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:49.200
So now we want to show.

00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:50.360


00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:53.020
The x n.

00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:56.820
The sequence of elements.

00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:02.840
And as takeaway c.

00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:09.000
Such that x of n converges to c.

00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:10.640
And what we want to show.

00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:10.700
So.

00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:13.040
Is that.

00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:15.120
F of x n.

00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:18.300
Which is now a new sequence.

00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:20.960
Converges to L.

00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:23.540
As then goes to infinity.

00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:29.480
So here I should write as.

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:32.200
In goes to infinity in here.

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:37.560
Okay.

00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:41.180
So let me move that.

00:53:41.580 --> 00:53:42.380
And let me draw.

00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:44.240
And of the picture of why.

00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:46.260
You should believe this.

00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:53.000
So remember what it means for a sequence to converge to a number.

00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:55.960
Means for every epsilon there exists a capital M.

00:53:56.260 --> 00:53:58.560
So that for all in bigger than or equal to capital M.

00:53:58.740 --> 00:53:59.680
The sequence is.

00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:02.940
Close to the number L within epsilon distance to it.

00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:04.420
So let's.

00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:07.420
Let's think about this a little bit.

00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:10.340
I'm not going to draw the graph.

00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:14.740
I'm just going to draw two copies of the number line.

00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:17.820
Here we have.

00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:20.580
Number L.

00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:22.660
Here's the number C.

00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:24.460
And.

00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:27.380
Plus epsilon.

00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:29.080
Remind us epsilon.

00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:29.360
So.

00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:32.260
And epsilon be positive.

00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:39.960
And the idea is we want to be able to find or say there exists a natural

00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:41.020
number capital M.

00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:46.220
So that in bigger than or equal to capital M implies f of x in is inside this interval.

00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:47.000
Here.

00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:48.220
Now.

00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:52.520
Since f of x converges to L.

00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:54.840
As x converges to C.

00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:55.960
And.

00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:58.560
There exists a delta.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.020
So that.

00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:04.260
So this is a picture that goes along with it.

00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:06.240
So that.

00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:09.640
If I'm inside this interval here.

00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:17.720
Then I get mapped into this interval here.

00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:22.080
So this is what I get from the assumption.

00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:34.540
So then how I should choose the natural number capital M is so that all of the x sub n's.

00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:39.400
Lie in this interval C minus delta C plus delta.

00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:44.000
And if I can arrange that, which I can because the x sub n's converged to C.

00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:48.940
Then I will get that these guys.

00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:54.160
It mapped into this interval L plus epsilon L minus epsilon.

00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:55.280
Okay.

00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:57.080
And that's the whole idea of the proof.

00:55:57.520 --> 00:55:58.700
Now we just need to write it down.

00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:09.000
Since f of x converges to L.

00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:12.400
There exists a delta positive.

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:14.980
Such that if.

00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:19.400
Listen delta.

00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:20.360
Then.

00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:24.900
If x minus L is less than epsilon.

00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:28.920
That's what I drew in yellow there.

00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:29.760
Now since.

00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:34.420
The sequence x sub n.

00:56:35.420 --> 00:56:36.260
Equal C.

00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:42.640
This implies that there exists some natural number M sub zero.

00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:45.220
Such that.

00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:48.620
All in bigger than or equal to M sub zero.

00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:55.720
And since all of these x sub n's are not equal to C by assumption there in the set S take away C.

00:56:57.160 --> 00:57:01.200
X of n minus C and actual values bigger than zero and less than delta.

00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:04.340
And so.

00:57:04.340 --> 00:57:09.560
This follows from the definition of convergence of sequences to a point here.

00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:13.040
If you like, I'm choosing epsilon in that definition to be delta.

00:57:13.580 --> 00:57:18.120
And this delta is coming from the definition for convergence of functions.

00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:26.500
And so we'll choose capital M to be.

00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:29.260
This integer M sub zero.

00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:34.340
And if N is bigger than or equal to M.

00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:39.200
I get that by our choice of it being M sub zero.

00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:41.520
I get that X of n minus C.

00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:43.200
This is less than delta.

00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:48.700
That means that it falls in this little yellow highlighted part in the first number line.

00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:53.060
Which implies.

00:57:58.020 --> 00:57:59.200
So you're what I'm using.

00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:04.560
It's what highlighted in blue.

00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:05.780
So this is.

00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:09.640
Content of this implication.

00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:11.740
implies that f.

00:58:13.020 --> 00:58:14.520
X in minus L.

00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:16.840
So that's an epsilon.

00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:20.680
Right. And that's, that's what we wanted to do. Right.

00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:21.640
We wanted to show that.

00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:25.780
There exists some natural number M so that in bigger than or equal to M.

00:58:26.460 --> 00:58:29.620
F. But X in minus L is less than epsilon and absolute value.

00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:31.500
And therefore.

00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:41.360
We've proved that the limit is in goes to infinity of this sequence f of X in equals L.

00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:51.200
Okay, so that's one direction of this if an only a statement.

00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:53.360
Let's prove the opposite direction.

00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:54.800
So.

00:58:57.740 --> 00:58:59.960
Suppose what's highlighted in green holds.

00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:07.080
Okay.

00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:10.280
And this proof is going to be by contradiction.

00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:13.800
So let's suppose that what hold what that our assumption.

00:59:14.140 --> 00:59:15.740
What what's in green holds.

00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:19.400
But the limit as X goes to C of f of X does not equal L.

00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:22.540
So now we're going to do the proof by.

00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:26.560
Contradiction.

00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:29.700
Meaning suppose the outcome is false.

00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:37.440
Okay.

00:59:38.440 --> 00:59:41.500
We're still assuming what's in green holds. That's our assumption.

00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:42.660
And we're.

00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:44.000
We're proof by contradiction.

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:52.400
We assume that the outcome or the conclusion is false, which is that the limit of as X goes to C of f of X is not equal L.

00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:56.720
Now what does what does this mean.

00:59:57.160 --> 01:00:02.080
So now we get to negate the definition and get better acquainted with it.

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:10.540
This means that so the definition of limit if you go back to the notes.

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:14.780
This is a for all epsilon there exists a delta statement.

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:22.220
So the negation is that there exists some bad epsilon epsilon zero.

01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:27.880
Such that for all delta positive.

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:35.140
There exists an X such that.

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:38.580
X is close to C.

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:43.640
But as far f of X is far away from L.

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:47.600
Okay.

01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:56.500
So the negation of the definition of limit of something being the limit is that there exists a bad epsilon so that.

01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:58.740
No matter how close I get to see.

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:04.800
I can find something very close to see that's far away from L. If I stick it into F.

01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:08.020
That's the.

01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:13.340
Intuitive way of viewing the negation of this definition.

01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:23.020
Okay.

01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:24.980
So the one over in for in a natural number.

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:25.760
Okay.

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:27.000
So.

01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:32.320
And this says so this statement.

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:37.380
Here is a for all delta statement.

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:37.860
So.

01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:42.480
And holds for every delta I pick.

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.740
So for all in a natural number.

01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:48.560
There exists an X of n.

01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:56.900
So that zero is bigger than X of n minus C is less than delta.

01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:58.620
I'm going to pick to be one over in.

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:11.920
And F of X of n minus L is less is bigger than or equal to epsilon zero.

01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:13.080
So first off.

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:15.500
I made it for all in statement.

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:17.360
Let's think about this for just a second.

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:19.220
So certainly for delta equals one.

01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:21.260
I can find a number X of one.

01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:25.620
Satisfying zero is less than X minus C is less than one.

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:30.280
And F of X minus F of X of one minus L is bigger than or equal to epsilon zero.

01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:33.540
But delta can be anything I choose.

01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:33.940


01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.100
Delta equal to half.

01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:38.160
I can find an X of two such that.

01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:41.160
X of two minus C is less than one half.

01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:45.580
And F of X minus L is bigger than or equal to epsilon zero.

01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:48.520
So I'm just choosing delta to be one over n.

01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:51.920
For each in a natural number.

01:02:57.580 --> 01:02:59.080
Choosing delta to be one over in.

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:02.840
Okay.

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:04.680
Is this point clear?

01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:11.640
Okay.

01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:15.900
Please stop me if you have if you have questions and something is not clear.

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:17.900
Okay.

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:19.000
So I have this sequence.

01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:26.160
Of elements of S that are not equal to C because they're an absolute value bigger than.

01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:30.800
Zero or the absolute value of X of n minus C is bigger than zero.

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:35.660
And they satisfy this and equal these two inequalities.

01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:36.380


01:03:41.140 --> 01:03:43.980
Then let me just write this inequality again.

01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:58.040
So, so then the quality, the inequality that I have is for all in the natural number zero is less than X of n minus C is less than one over n.

01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:06.680
I claim that the X of n's must then converge to see what the what tool can I use to say that.

01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:15.240
Please do them.

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:15.700
Okay.

01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:24.700
Because this thing on the left zero this if you like is a sequence just a constant sequence this converges to zero.

01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:29.980
And one over n something on the right converges to zero as in goes to infinity.

01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:34.140
So that implies the thing that sandwich in between gets squeezed to zero.

01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:35.520
So that implies.

01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:42.880
And then it goes to infinity of X of n minus C equals zero i e.

01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:44.640
X n's converge to see.

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:55.320
Now, I'm assuming what's in green holds right, which is if I take any sequence converging to see f of X n has to converge to L.

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:56.480
Okay.

01:04:58.280 --> 01:04:59.120
So by.

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:03.360
What's in green is given me this implication.

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:06.520
Zero must be equal to.

01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:12.840
Limit as n goes to infinity of f of X of n minus L.

01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:17.080
But what I know is that.

01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:28.560
Since I've assumed f of X is not converged to L along the sequence each of these guys is bigger than or equal to epsilon not, which is positive.

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:35.920
So now I've concluded that zero is bigger than zero.

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:38.520
And that's a contradiction.

01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:44.440
Okay.

01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:47.520
Okay.

01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:48.140
So next time.

01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:51.520
We'll talk about applications of this theorem.

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:51.900
And then we'll talk about the.

01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:52.380
We'll talk about the.

01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:53.440
You'll have any questions about.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.820
This proof for anything that we've covered so far today.

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:17.140
Okay.

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:22.360
I mean, how you get the choice of delta from doing.

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:24.380
Right.

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:28.440
So let me phrase this.

01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:46.440
Yeah.

01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:47.140
Yeah.

01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:47.280


01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:53.860
I mean, so, you know, I probably in most classes, you would just be given this proof that's over here on the left.

01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:57.660
And somehow it looks like magic that I chose this delta this way.

01:06:57.980 --> 01:06:59.200
And it ends up working.

01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:00.060
Right.

01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:03.400
But the thinking that goes in behind it is.

01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:06.440
So what's the thing you want?

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:07.540
You want what's in yellow.

01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:08.240
Okay.

01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:09.980
So let me erase some of what's in yellow.

01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:14.440
You want to choose delta so that.

01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:20.100
If you take f of x minus a c plus b, that thing in absolute value will be less than epsilon.

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:20.860
Okay.

01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:25.720
So start with that thing that you want to make small.

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:30.400
That you want to ensure a small f of x minus a c plus b.

01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:32.640
And start computing.

01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:36.120
And when you compute it, you get the.

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:39.200
What we got here in the second bit of yellow.

01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:41.280
Okay.

01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:45.800
And we're assuming that the absolute value of x minus c is less than delta.

01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:46.400
All right.

01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:50.300
We're trying to choose delta so that what's in green implies what's in yellow.

01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:51.180
Okay.

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:53.180
So far we haven't chosen delta.

01:07:53.660 --> 01:07:57.980
We just know that the absolute the absolute value of x minus c will be less than delta.

01:07:57.980 --> 01:08:01.000
And we want to choose delta so that that implies.

01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:05.260
What's in yellow after the arrow there.

01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:07.840
So when we do this computation.

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:13.300
And assuming that the absolute value of x minus c is less than delta, we get.

01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:16.000
This thing right here.

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:23.000
The absolute value of a times delta.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:28.040
This is just assuming that the absolute value of x minus c is less than delta, which is what.

01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:30.920
What will be assuming.

01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:35.260
So and we want what's in yellow, which is that thing to be less than epsilon.

01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:42.860
So what we've arrived at is this thing here, which we want less than epsilon is less than this thing in red.

01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:44.100
Okay.

01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:52.920
And therefore we want to choose the delta so that the thing in red is less than epsilon or less than or equal to epsilon.

01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:59.320
That will tell that will ensure that f of x minus a c plus b and absolute value will be less than epsilon.

01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:00.200
Okay.

01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:01.740
So I'm not solving an inequality.

01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:06.940
You know, I'm not solving the inequality I want, which is f of x minus a c plus b.

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:12.160
I'm starting with what's on the left estimating it using my assumptions.

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:16.300
And then at the end choosing delta so that I come up with epsilon in the end.

01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:21.680
So in the last step, I have absolute value of a times delta.

01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:24.960
And I want that to be less than epsilon.

01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:32.760
So I could have chosen, you know, delta to be less than epsilon over less than or equal to epsilon over a.

01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:43.900
So anything, anything, any delta like that would have worked. So I could have put s delta to be epsilon over 2 a that still would have worked or 3a.

01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:44.780
Okay.

01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:48.580
So.

01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:01.360
Yeah, it's what the green. That's the thing where we're doing me.

01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:05.500
And we get to use in this comment mutation.

01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:09.800
Are there any other questions?

01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:50.220
This is a, this is a style thing. All right. So throughout throughout this entire semester.

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:55.040
You know, for all epsilon, you have to be able to find a M.

01:10:55.500 --> 01:11:01.020
So that's something happens, right? So at some point you always say choose M to be something.

01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:11.320
Right. Maybe it's the maximum of some M zero M one that you had or choose M to be one so that one over M is less than epsilon or something like that.

01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:18.400
I'm just sticking with that style of saying choose M to be this. Otherwise, I could have said,

01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:25.980
there exists a capital number M. So that for all in bigger than or equal to capital M.

01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:38.340
X of n minus C is less than delta and then move to the next part. But, you know, throughout the course, I've always like, at least the proofs I presented, you know, you're, you're making a choice of capital M.

01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:55.820
Right. You're always it's for all epsilon, there exists a capital M. So that means you have to tell me how to choose capital M. And it's the same thing with these, you know, epsilon delta proofs is that for all epsilon, there exists a delta. So at some point you have to tell me how to choose delta in the proof.

01:11:57.380 --> 01:12:01.980
So I just kind of stuck with that style of saying choose M to be something.

01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:16.420
Although you're absolutely right that I could have just said for all in bigger than or equal to capital M zero, I have what I want. And therefore, you know, implicitly, I'm saying that M equals M zero is the thing that works.

01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:34.260
Yeah, that's the same delta.

01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:36.820
Yeah, that's the same delta.
