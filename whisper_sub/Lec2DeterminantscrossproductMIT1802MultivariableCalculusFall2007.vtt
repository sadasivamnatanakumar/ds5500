00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.160
Thank you.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.980
So OK, let's continue with the course.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.040
And operator Vincent van.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.400
So remember, yesterday we saw the topic yesterday

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.480
was dot product.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.860
And remember, the definition of dot product,

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.320
well, the dot product of two vectors

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.960
is obtained by multiplying the first component

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.920
with the first component, the second with the second,

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.580
and so on.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.460
And summing these, and you get the scalar.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.860
And the geometric interpretation of that

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.200
is that you can also take the length of A,

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.720
take the length of B, multiply them,

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.860
and multiply that by the cosine of the angle

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.380
between the two vectors.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.960
So we've seen several applications of that.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.440
So one application is to find lengths and angles.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.340
So for example, well, you can use this relation to give you

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.260
that the cosine of the angle between two vectors

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.360
is the dot product divided by the product of the length.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.360
Another application that we have is to detect

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.140
whether two vectors are perpendicular.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.220
So to decide if two vectors are perpendicular to each other,

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.680
all we have to do is compute that dot product.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.020
And see if we get zero.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.340
OK.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.840
And well, one third application that we didn't have time

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.780
to discuss yesterday, that I will mention very quickly,

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:52.040
is to find components of, so let's say,

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.460
we find the component of a vector A along a direction,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.960
u, so some unit vector.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.060
So let me explain.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.060
Let's say that I have some direction.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.380
For example, the horizontal axis on this blackboard,

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.080
but it could be any direction in space.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.080
And to describe this direction, maybe I

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.860
have a unit vector along this axis.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.320
Let's say that I have any other vector A,

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.540
and I want to find out what is the component of a along u.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.560
So that means what is the length of this projection of a

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.260
to the given direction?

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.860
OK.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:51.920
So this thing here is the component of a along u.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.960
Well, how do we find that?

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.220
Well, we know that here we have a right angle.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:10.040
So this component is just length a times cosine of the angle,

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.960
between a and u.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.440
But now that means actually we can compute it very easily,

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.380
because, well, I could, you know, that's the same as length a

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.440
times length u times cosine theta, because u is a unit vector.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.360
It's a unit vector, that means this is equal to 1.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.840
And so that's the same as the dot product between a and u.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:40.320
OK.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:41.760
So that's very easy.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.000
And of course, the most obvious cases of that is, say,

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.640
for example, we want us to find the component along i hat,

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.300
the first axis, you know, the unit vector along the x axis.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.500
Then you do the dot product with i hat, which is 1,00,

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.540
what you get is the first component.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.000
And that's indeed the x component of the vector.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.480
Similarly, say you want the z component,

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.160
you do the dot product with k, that gives you

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.800
the last component of your vector.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.460
But the same works with a unit vector in any direction.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.080
So what's an application of that?

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.140
Well, for example, in physics, maybe you

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:32.120
have seen situations where you have a pendulum that swings.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.520
So you have maybe some mass at the end of a string.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.300
And that mass swings back and forth on a circle.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.680
And to analyze this mechanically, you

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.120
want to use, of course, Newton's laws of mechanics.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.240
And you want to use, well, you know, forces and so on.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.920
But I claim that components of vectors

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.540
are useful here to understand what happens geometrically.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.940
So what other forces exerted on this pendulum?

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:10.280
Well, there's its weight, which usually points downwards.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.500
And there's the tension of the string.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.360
And these two forces together are what explains how this pendulum

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.200
is going to move back and forth.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.320
Now, you could try to understand the equations of mothin

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.320
using xy coordinates, or maybe xz, or whatever

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.900
you want to call them, let's say xy.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.880
But really, what causes the pendulum to swing back and forth

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.840
and also to somehow stay at constant distance,

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.840
are phenomena relative to this circular trajectory.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.400
So for example, maybe instead of taking components

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.740
along the x and y axis, we want to look at two other unit

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:04.100
vectors.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.680
So we can look at a vector, let's call it t,

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.140
that's tangent to the trajectory.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.040
So I can you read that?

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.000
Maybe it's not very readable.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:28.620
T is tangent to the trajectory.

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:37.040
And on the other hand, we can introduce another vector.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.360
Let's call that n.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:48.120
And that one is normal perpendicular to the trajectory.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.840
And so now, if you think about it,

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.020
you can look at the components of the weight

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.980
along the tangent direction and along the normal direction.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:15.840
And so the component of f along the tangent direction

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.060
is what causes acceleration in the direction

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:20.860
along the trajectory.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.420
It's what causes the pendulum to swing back and forth.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:41.580
And the component along n on the other hand.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:49.720
So that's the part of the weight that tends to pull our mass

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:53.900
away from this point is what's going to be responsible

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.520
for the tension of the string.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:00.500
It's why the string is stowed and not actually slack

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.840
and with things moving all over the place.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:12.540
So that one is responsible for the tension of the string.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.160
And now, of course, if you want to compute things,

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.500
well, maybe you will call this angle theta

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.640
and then you will express things explicitly using signs

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.080
and cosines and you will solve for the equations of motion.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.040
Okay, that would be a very interesting physics problem,

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.440
but to save time, we're not going to do it.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.900
I'm sure you've seen that in 801 or similar classes.

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:43.080
And so to find this components, we would just do dot products.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.360
Okay, any questions?

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.100
No?

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.780
Okay, so let's move on to our next topic.

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:03.080
So here we have found things about lengths, angles

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.300
and stuff like that.

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:11.260
One important concept that we haven't understood yet

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.160
in terms of vectors is Aria.

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:23.840
So let's say that we want to find the Aria of this pentagon.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.660
Well, how do we compute that using vectors?

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:29.000
Can we do it using vectors?

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:31.540
Yes, we can.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:33.920
And that's going to be the goal, but how?

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:41.420
So the first thing we should do is probably simplify the problem.

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:44.340
You know, we don't actually need to bother with pentagons,

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.020
or we need to know our triangles.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.240
Because for example, you can cut that into three triangles

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.800
and then some Aria of the triangles.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:11:02.340
Okay, so perhaps easier, what's the Aria of a triangle?

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.660
So let's start with a triangle in the plane.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.980
And well, then we need two vectors to describe it.

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.280
Say, A and B here.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.860
How do we find the Aria of a triangle?

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.240
Well, we all know base times height of R2.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.060
So what's the base?

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:25.700
What's the height?

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:34.360
Well, so the Aria of this triangle is going to be one half of the base

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.800
is going to be the length of A and the height.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:43.540
Well, if you call theta this angle, then this is length B sine theta.

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.660
Now, that looks a lot like the formula we had there,

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.280
except for one little catch.

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:55.800
This is a sine instead of a cosine.

00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:58.900
How do we deal with that?

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:07.000
Well, what we could do is first find the cosine of the angle.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.900
We know how to find the cosine of the angle using that product.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:19.200
Then solve for sine using sine square plus cosine square

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:20.820
equals one.

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:23.800
And then plug that back into here.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:28.480
Well, that works, but it's kind of a very complicated way of doing it.

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:29.520
So that's an easier way.

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.580
And that's going to be determinants.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.740
But let me explain how we get to that.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:39.020
Maybe still doing elementary geometry and dot products first.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.360
So let's see.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:55.200
What we can do is instead of finding the sine of theta,

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.120
well, we're not good at finding signs of angles,

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:59.420
but we are very good now at finding cosines of angles.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:05.000
So maybe we can find another angle whose cosine is the same as the sine of theta.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.660
Well, you probably heard about complementary angles.

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:17.520
And how, if I take my vector A, if I have my vector B here, I have an angle theta.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:24.660
Well, let's say that I rotate my vector A by 90 degrees to get a new vector A prime.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:34.640
So A prime is just A rotated by 90 degrees.

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:39.860
Then the angle between these two guys, let's say theta prime,

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:47.880
well, theta prime is 90 degrees or pi over 2 radians minus theta.

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:53.800
So in particular, cosine of theta prime is equal to sine of theta.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:07.780
So in particular, that means that length A, length B sine theta,

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:12.660
which is what we would need to know in order to find the area of this triangle,

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:17.960
is equal to, well, A and A prime have the same length.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.420
So let me replace that by length of A prime.

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.000
I'm not changing anything.

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:25.800
Length B cosine theta prime.

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:34.140
And now we have something that's much easier, of course, because that's just A prime dot B.

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:38.580
So that looks like a very good plan.

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:43.820
There's only one small thing which is we don't know yet how to find this A prime.

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:47.500
Well, I claim it's not very hard.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:49.720
Let's see.

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:54.500
Why don't you guys do the hard work?

00:14:55.400 --> 00:15:01.980
So let's say that I have a plane vector A with two components, A1, A2,

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:05.340
and I want to rotate it counterclockwise by 90 degrees.

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:11.940
So it looks like maybe we should change some signs somewhere,

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.500
maybe we should do something with a component.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:20.220
Can you come up with an idea of what it might be?

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:33.800
Okay, so I see a lot of people answering three.

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:39.280
I see some other answers, but the majority vote seems to be number three.

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:43.360
Minus A2 and A1.

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:45.280
I think I agree.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:46.620
So let's see.

00:15:49.280 --> 00:16:03.440
Let's say that we have this vector A with components A1, so A1 is here and A2.

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:04.400
So A2 is here.

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:08.340
Okay, let's rotate this box by 90 degrees counterclockwise.

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:19.040
So this rectangular box ends up there, it's the same box, just flitting it side.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:25.660
So this length here becomes A1 and this length here becomes A2.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.580
And that means our new vector A prime

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.840
is going to be, well, the first component looks like an A2,

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:41.500
but it's pointing to the left when A2 is positive, so it's minus A2.

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:48.860
And the Y component is going to be the same as this guy, so it's going to be A1.

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.980
If you wanted instead to rotate clockwise, then you would do the opposite.

00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:58.880
You would do A2 minus A1.

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:03.760
Okay, is that reasonably clear for everyone?

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:13.580
Okay, so, well, let's continue at calculation there.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:20.040
A prime we've decided is minus A2 from A1.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:27.680
So minus A2, A1, dot product with, let's call B1 and B2, the components of B,

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:36.140
then that will be, well, minus A2, B1 plus A1, B2.

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:37.720
Let me write that the other way around.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.220
A1, B2, minus A2, B1.

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:52.000
And that's a quantity that you may already know, and of the name of determinant of vectors A and B,

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:58.640
which we've write symbolically using this notation.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:05.560
So we put A and B next to each other inside a 2x2 table, and we put this vertical bars,

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:12.340
and that means the determinant of these numbers, it means this guy times this guy,

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.300
minus this guy times this guy.

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:18.920
Okay, so that's called the determinant.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:36.600
And geometrically what it measures is the area, well, not of a triangle,

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:40.880
because we didn't divide by 2, but of a parallelogram formed by A and B.

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:50.800
So it measures the area of the parallelogram with sides A and B.

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:55.540
And of course, if you want the triangle, then you will just divide by 2.

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:57.720
Okay, the triangle is half the parallelogram.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.440
There's one small catch.

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:05.000
The area usually is something that's going to be positive.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:11.460
This guy here has no reason to be positive or negative, because in fact,

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:25.940
well, if you compute things, you will see that whether it's positive or negative depends on whether A and B are clockwise or counterclockwise from each other.

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:32.860
I mean, the issue that we have, well, when we say the area is one half length A, length B, sine theta,

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:37.340
that was assuming that theta is positive, that its sine is positive.

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:42.560
Otherwise, if theta is negative, maybe we need to take the absolute value of this.

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:49.700
So just to be more thoughtful, I will say the determinant is either plus or minus the area.

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:58.000
Okay, any questions about this?

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:03.460
Yes?

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:16.220
Oh, sorry, that's not a dot product. That's a usual multiplication.

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:21.580
Okay? That's a length A times length B times sine theta.

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:29.340
And so that's equal to the area of the parallelogram.

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:33.000
So, let me explain that again.

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:44.820
So if I have two vectors A and B, so I can form a parallelogram with them, I can form a triangle.

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:59.640
And so the area of the parallelogram is equal to length A, length B sine theta, is equal to the determinant of A and B.

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:09.900
While the area of a triangle is one half of that.

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:24.880
And again, to be thoughtful, I should say, these things can be positive or negative.

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:33.220
So depending on whether you can't fangle positively or negatively, you will get either the area or minus the area.

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:36.720
The area is actually the absolute value of this quantity.

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:40.140
Okay, is that clearer?

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:44.020
Okay.

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:49.020
Yes?

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:49.780


00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:59.960
So if you want to compute the area, you will just take the absolute value of a determinant.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:06.960
Okay? So, our area will be...

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:18.080
Well, I should say the area of the parallelogram, so that it's completely clear.

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:22.060
Sorry. You have a question?

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:33.520
Explain again. Sorry. Let's have a question.

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:35.920
How the determinant equals the area of the parallelogram?

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:43.100
Okay. So the area of the parallelogram, it's going to be the base times the height.

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:50.920
So the base, let's take this guy to be the base, so the length of the base will be length of A.

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:57.740
And the height will be obtained by ticking B, but only looking at the vertical part.

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:01.400
So that will be length of B times the sine of theta.

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:06.820
Okay, so that's how I got the area of the parallelogram is length A, length B sine theta.

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:11.200
And then I did this manipulation and this trick of rotating to find a nice formula.

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:15.220
Yes?

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:24.680
So you're asking ahead of what I'm going to do in a few minutes.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:30.260
So you're asking about magnitude of A cross B. So we're going to learn about cross product in a few minutes.

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:34.260
And the answer is yes, but cross product is for vectors in space.

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.940
Here I was simplifying things by doing things just in the plane.

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:42.620
Okay? So just bear with me for five more minutes and we'll do things in space.

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:48.600
Yes?

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:52.740
If you're trying to find a numerical value, the term is just to be one, two, two.

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:56.960
That's correct. The way you compute this in practice is you just do this.

00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:58.760
Okay, that's how you compute the determinant.

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:04.740
Yes? What about?

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:08.840
So Fred, I'm going to do now. Okay?

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:13.500
More questions? Should we move to... Okay, let's move to space.

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:23.380
So...

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:28.460
So there's two things we can do in space.

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:37.180
And you know, you can find... you can look for the volume of solids or you can look for the area of surfaces.

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:41.200
So let me start with the easier of the two. Let me start with volumes of solids.

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:44.580
And we'll go back to area. I promise.

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:44.720
Yes?

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:59.220
So I claim that there's also an option of determinant in space and that's going to tell us how to find volumes.

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:07.740
So let's say that we have three vectors, a, b and c.

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:20.220
And then the definition of their determinant is going to be...

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:27.320
So the notation for that in terms of the components is the same as above air.

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:37.500
We put the components of a, the components of b, and the components of c inside vertical bars.

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:41.920
Okay? And of course I have to give a meaning to this.

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.960
So this will be a number. And what is that number?

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:55.700
Well, the definition I will take is that this is a1 times the determinant of what I get by looking in this lower right corner.

00:25:55.700 --> 00:26:00.320
So the two by two determinant, b2, b3, c2, c3.

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:10.180
Then I will subtract a2 times the determinant of b1, b3, c1, c3.

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:22.120
And then I will add a3 times the determinant, b1, b2, c1, c2.

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:29.020
And each of these guys means again you take b2 times c3 minus c2 times b3.

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.360
And this times that, minus this, times that, and so on.

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.860
So in fact there's a total of six terms in here.

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:43.180
Okay? And maybe some of you have already seen a different formula for three by three determinants where you directly have the six terms, it's the same.

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:44.360
It's the same definition.

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:48.940
So how to remember the structure of this formula?

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:55.040
Well, this is called an expansion according to the first row.

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:59.840
So we're going to take the entries in the first row, a1, a2, a3.

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:02.620
And for each of them we get a term.

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:11.860
Namely we multiply it by a 2 by 2 determinant that we get by deleting the first row and the column where we are.

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:19.480
So here the coefficient next to a1 is, well, we delete this column and this row.

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.580
And we are left with b2, b3, c2, c3.

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:28.400
Next, the next one we take a2, we delete the row that's in it.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.880
And the column that it's in.

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:35.620
And we are left with b1, b3, c1, c3.

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:40.880
And similarly with a3 we take what remains, that's b1, b2, c1, c2.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:46.460
Finally, last but not least, there's a minus sign here for the second guy.

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:48.260


00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:55.060
So, well, it looks like a weird formula.

00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:05.300
And I mean, it is a little bit weird, but it's a formula that you should learn, because it's really, really useful for a lot of things.

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:13.140
So, I should say, if this looks very artificial to you and you like to know more, there's more in the notes.

00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:19.040
So, read the notes, they will tell you a bit more about what this means, where it comes from, and so on.

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:29.540
If you want to know a lot more, then someday you should take 1806 linear algebra, where you will learn a lot more about determinants in n-dimensional space with n vectors.

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:34.560
And there's a generalization of this in arbitrary dimensions.

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:37.820
In this class, we'll only deal with two or three dimensions.

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:39.180
Yes?

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:44.220
Sorry, why is the negative there?

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:54.340
Well, that's a very good question. It has to be there, so that this will actually equal, well, what I'm going to say right now, is that this will give us the volume of the box with size ABC.

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.540
And the formula just doesn't work if you don't put the negative.

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:10.960
There's a more fundamental reason which has to do with orientation of space, and the fact that if you switch two coordinates in space, then basically you change what's called the handedness of the coordinates.

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:15.860
If you look at your right hand and your left hand, they are not actually the same, they are mirror images.

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:20.740
And if you swap two coordinate axes, that's what you get. That's the fundamental reason for the minus.

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:27.280
But again, I mean, we don't need to think too much about that, all we need in this class is the formula.

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:45.320
So, why do we care about this formula? It's because of a theorem that says that, geometrically,

00:29:48.680 --> 00:30:02.420
the determinant of the three vectors ABC is, again, plus or minus, this determinant could be positive or negative, see, that's minus is and that's all sorts of stuff.

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:08.800
Plus or minus the volume of the parallelepipad.

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:18.360
But just a fancy name for a box with parallelegram sides in case you wonder.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:33.240
With sides A, B, and C. So you take your three vectors A, B, and C, and you form a box with sides are all parallelegrams.

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:39.180
And when it's a volume, it's going to be for determinant.

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:49.540
Okay. Are there questions?

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:53.800
I'll look at it.

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:00.820
I'm sorry, I can't quite hear you.

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:14.420
Yes, we are going to see how to do it geometrically without a determinant.

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:18.120
But then you'll see that you actually need a determinant to compute it, no matter what.

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:22.060
So we're going to go back to this and see another formula for volume.

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:30.040
But you'll see that really I'm cheating. I mean, the important way, somehow computationally, the only way to compute it is whether to use a determinant.

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:32.680
Yes?

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:39.780
If you can determine it to be form of the first four vectors, it's alternating.

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:43.380
That's correct.

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:51.280
I mean, actually, if you look at the two-by-two determinant, you can also explain it in terms of this expansion.

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:55.220
You take A1 and multiply by this one-by-one determinant, B2.

00:31:55.740 --> 00:32:00.960
Then you take A2, you multiply it by this one-by-one determinant, B1, but you put a minus sign.

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:06.160
And in general, indeed, when you expand, you would start putting plus minus plus minus alternatingly.

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:09.320
More about that in 1806.

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:10.020
Yes?

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:20.140
There's a way to do it based on other rows as well, but then you have to be very careful with the sign factors.

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:21.920
So I refer you to the notes for that.

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:26.200
If you did it with, I mean, you could also do it with a column, by the way.

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:28.160
Just, I mean, be careful about the sign rules.

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:35.600
So given how little will use the terminance in this class, I mean, will use them in a way that's fundamental, but we won't compute much.

00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:38.700
So let's say this is going to be enough for us for now.

00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:42.400
Okay.

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:49.100
So after the terminance, now I can tell you about cross-product.

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:53.380
And cross-product is going to be the answer to your question about Arria.

00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:32.820
Okay.

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:39.940
So let me move on to cross-product.

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:50.580
So cross-product is something that you can apply to two vectors in space.

00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:56.540
And that I mean really in free-dimensional space, okay.

00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:59.780
This is something that's specific to free-dimensions.

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:14.180
So the definition, a cross-b, so it's important to really do your multiplication symbol well so that you don't mistake it with a dot product.

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:17.940
Well, that's going to be a vector.

00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:19.740
Okay.

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:26.300
So that's another reason not to confuse it with dot product.

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:27.640
Dot product gives you a number.

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:29.600
Cross-product gives you a vector.

00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:31.940
So they're really completely different operations.

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:40.960
They're both called product because, well, somehow one couldn't come up with a better name, but they're completely different operations.

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:41.760
Okay.

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:44.320
So what do we do to do the cross-product of A and B?

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:46.800
Well, we do something very strange.

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:51.800
Just as I've told you that a determinant is something where we put numbers and we get a number.

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:54.400
I'm going to violate my own rule.

00:34:54.820 --> 00:35:08.700
I'm going to put together a determinant in which, well, the last two rows are the components of the vectors A and B.

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:13.800
But the first row strangely consists of the unit vectors i, j, k.

00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:15.720
What does that mean?

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:20.180
Well, that certainly is not a determinant in the usual sense.

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:24.160
You cannot, you know, if you try to put that into your calculator, it will tell you there's an error.

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:26.060
I don't know how to put vectors in there.

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.080
I want numbers.

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:33.480
What it means is it's a symbolic notation that helps you remember what the formula is.

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:37.060
So the actual formula is, well, you use this definition.

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:44.900
And, you know, if you use this definition, you see that it's i hat times some number.

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:47.120
Okay.

00:35:47.140 --> 00:36:00.280
So let me write it as determinant of A2, A3, B2, B3 times i hat, minus determinant A1, A3, B1, B3,

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:08.480
J hat, plus A1, A2, B1, B2, k hat.

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:15.340
Okay. And so that's the actual definition in a way that makes complete sense.

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:22.180
But to remember this formula without too much trouble, it's much easier to think about it in these terms here.

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:25.540
Okay. So that's a definition.

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:27.620
And it gives you a vector.

00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:32.380
Now, as usual, with definitions, the question is what is it good for?

00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:35.580
What is the geometric meaning of this very strange operation?

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:37.540
Why do we bother to do that?

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:46.520
So here's what it does geometrically.

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:53.300
So remember, a vector has two different things.

00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:55.920
It has a length and it has a direction.

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:57.600
Okay. Let's start with the length.

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:17.760
The length of a cross product is the area of the parallelogram in space formed by the vectors A and B.

00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:31.820
Okay. So now if you have a parallelogram in space, you can find it's a r r just by doing this calculation when you know the coordinates of the point.

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:39.240
You do this calculation and then you take the length. So the length you take this square plus that square plus that square root.

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:45.260
It looks like a very complicated formula, but it works and actually it's the simplest way to do it.

00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:54.760
Okay. This time we don't actually need to put plus or minus because the length of a vector is always positive.

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:56.380
We don't have to worry about that.

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:06.580
And what's even more magical is that not only is the length remarkable, but the direction is also remarkable.

00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:17.260
So the direction of a cross B is perpendicular to the plane of a parallelogram.

00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:33.100
So you know, our two vectors, A and B together, the determine a plane.

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:46.140
And what I'm telling you is that the vector A cross B will point, will stick straight out of that plane perpendicularly to it.

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:59.620
Okay. So in fact, I have to be more precise. There's two ways that you can be perpendicular to this plane.

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:05.180
You can be perpendicular pointing up or pointing down. How do I decide which?

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:17.500
Well, there's something called the right hand rule. Okay. So what does the right hand rule say?

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:22.120
Well, there's various versions for right hand rule depending on which country you learn about it.

00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:27.720
In France, given the culture, you even learn about it in terms of a cox-court and a wine bottle.

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:37.440
But I think I'll just use the usual version here. So you take your right hand. If you're left handed, remember to take your right hand, not the left one.

00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:47.080
The other right. Okay. And then place your hand to point in the direction of A. So let's say my right hand is going in that direction.

00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:53.400
Now curl your fingers so that they point towards B. So here that would be kind of into the blackboard.

00:39:54.100 --> 00:40:00.980
Okay. Don't snap any bones. If it doesn't quite work, then rotate your arm so that you can actually physically do it.

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:09.680
Then, you know, get your firm to stick straight out. Well, here my firm is going to go up. And that tells me that A cross B will go up.

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:15.760
Okay. So let me write that down while you experiment with it.

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:20.080
Again, try not to injure yourselves.

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:49.720
So first your right hand points parallel to vector A. Then fingers point in the direction of B. Then your firm, when you stick it out,

00:40:49.720 --> 00:41:04.300
which is going to point in the direction of A cross B. Okay. Let's do a quick example. Let's make a quick example.

00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:12.440
So here. Let's take i cross B.

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:30.440
Okay.

00:41:42.420 --> 00:42:11.900
So let's take a quick example.

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:12.360
If you have it pointing in the wrong direction, it might mean that you're using your left hand, for example.

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:18.620
And then your firm is going to point up. Okay. So that tells us it's roughly pointing up.

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:26.360
And of course the length should be 1 because if you take the unit square in the xy plane, its area is 1.

00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:32.100
And the direction should indeed be vertical because it should be perpendicular to the xy plane.

00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:38.760
So it looks like i cross j will be k. Well let's check with a definition.

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:50.000
ijk, what is i? i is 100, j is 0, 1, 0.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:58.240
So the coefficient of i will be 0 times 0 minus 0 times 1, that's 0.

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:03.580
coefficient of j will be 1 times 0 minus 0 times 0, that's 0.

00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:13.940
Minus 0j, it doesn't matter, but. And the coefficient of k will be 1 times 1, that's 1, minus 0 times 0.

00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:20.480
So we do get i cross j equals k both ways.

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:28.260
In this case it's easier to do geometrically. If I give you more complicated vectors, probably you will actually want to do the calculation.

00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:34.800
Okay. Any questions? Yes.

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:47.080
So the coefficient of k, remember i take, so i delete the first row and the last column.

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:53.420
So i get this 2 by 2 determinant. But 2 by 2 determinant is 1 times 1 minus 0 times 0.

00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:59.180
So that gives me 1. That's what you do with 2 by 2 determinants.

00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:01.900
Similarly for the others, but the others turn out to be 0.

00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:06.020
More questions?

00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:14.840
Yes, let me repeat how i got the 1 in front of k.

00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:19.500
So remember the definition of a determinant.

00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:27.940
I expand according to the entries in the first row. When i get to k, what i do is i delete the first row.

00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:31.080
And i delete the last column, the column that contains k.

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:37.480
So i delete this guys and this guys. I'm left with this 2 by 2 determinant.

00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:47.920
Now with 2 by 2 determinant, you multiply according to this downward diagonal and then minus this times that.

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:59.180
So 1 times 1, let me say here, I got 1k because that's 1 times 1 minus 0 times 0 equals 1.

00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:03.680
Sorry, and that's really hard to read. Maybe it will be easier to read.

00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:11.000
Yes.

00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:11.140


00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:22.900
Ah, okay. So let's try. If I do the same for i, I think I will also get 0.

00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:24.660
Okay. So let's do the same for i.

00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:30.420
So I think i, I delete the first row. I delete the first column.

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:38.980
I get this 2 by 2 determinant here and I get 0 times 0, but 0 minus 0 times 1.

00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:42.040
That's here the trick question. 0 times 1 is 0 as well.

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:44.400
So that's 0 minus 0 is 0.

00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:46.240
Okay.

00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:55.700
So I hope in Monday you should get more practice in recitation about how to compute determinants.

00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:59.400
So hopefully it will become very easy for you all to compute these things.

00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:07.280
And over first time it's kind of a shock because there's a lot of numbers and a lot of things to do.

00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:31.220
Hey.

00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:53.840
IT'S THREE THAT GOOD

00:46:58.900 --> 00:46:59.260
Ok

00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:11.260
So, let me return to the question that you asked a bit earlier about how do I find actually

00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:14.220
volume if I don't want to know about determinants.

00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:23.280
Well, so let's have another look at the volume.

00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:38.140
Okay, so let's say that I have three vectors, let me put them this way, A, B and C.

00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:44.660
And let's try to see how else I could think about the volume of this box.

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:54.460
Okay, so probably you know that the volume of the power of the LPP is the area of the base times the height.

00:47:55.180 --> 00:48:08.000
Okay, so sorry, the volume is the area of the base times the height.

00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:10.700
How do we do that in practice?

00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:13.740
Well, what's the area of the base?

00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:19.920
So, the base is a parallelogram in space with sides B and C.

00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:23.180
How do we find the area of the parallelogram in space?

00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:28.160
Well, we just discovered that we can do it by taking the cross product.

00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:35.280
So, the area of the base, well, we take the cross product of B and C, that's not quite it because this is a vector.

00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:37.820
We would like a number, well, we take its length.

00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:41.080
Okay, that's pretty good.

00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:43.080
What about the height?

00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:49.960
Well, the height is going to be the component of A in the direction that's perpendicular to the base.

00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:53.360
So, let's take a direction that's perpendicular to the base.

00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:56.400
Let's call that N, a unit vector in that direction.

00:48:57.660 --> 00:49:03.800
Then we can get the height by taking A dot N. That's what we saw at the beginning of class.

00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:09.460
Okay, that A dot N will tell me how much A goes in the direction of N.

00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:13.100
Okay, are you still with me?

00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:16.440
Okay, let's keep going.

00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:24.580
So, let's think about this vector N. How do I get it?

00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:32.720
Well, I can get it by actually using cross product as well because I said,

00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:38.900
for direction perpendicular to two vectors, I can get by taking the cross product and looking at that direction.

00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:42.960
So, this is still B cross C length.

00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:55.300
And this one is, so I claim, there should be an aside here, N can be obtained by taking B cross C,

00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:58.540
well, that point in the right direction, but it's not a unit vector.

00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:01.440
How do I get a unit vector? I divide by the length.

00:50:05.340 --> 00:50:12.340
Thanks, so I take B cross C and I divide by length B cross C.

00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:18.640
Well, now I can probably simplify between these two guys.

00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:22.340
And so, what I will get,

00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:39.880
it's going to be the last thing for today.

00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:52.700
What I get out of this is that my volume equals a dot product with the vector B cross C.

00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:55.240
And of course, I have to be careful in which order I do it.

00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:59.180
If I do it the other way around, A dot B, I get a number, I cannot cross that.

00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:03.420
So, I mean, I really have to do the cross product first, I get a new vector, and then I dot product.

00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:16.400
Okay, so the fact is that the determinant of A, B, C is equal to this so-called triple product.

00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:21.160
Well, that looks good geometrically.

00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:25.680
Let's try to check whether it makes sense with the formulas, just one small thing.

00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:38.960
So, we solve the determinant is A1 times determinant B2B3, C2C3 minus A2 times something plus A3 times something.

00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:40.840
I let you fill in the numbers.

00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:44.200
Okay, let's get this.

00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:47.380
What about this guy? Well, dot product.

00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:50.000
We take the first component of A, that's A1.

00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:53.220
We multiply by the first component of B cross C.

00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:55.100
What's the first component of B cross C?

00:51:55.360 --> 00:52:03.520
Well, it's this determinant B2B3C2C3.

00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:09.180
Right? If you look at, if you put B and C instead of A and B into there, you will get that right.

00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:10.660
I component is this guy.

00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:21.400
Okay, minus, well, plus A2 times the second component, which is minus some determinant, plus A3 times the third component, which is again a determinant.

00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:24.260
And you can check to get exactly the same expression.

00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:25.580
So, everything is fine.

00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:28.200
There's no contradiction in math just yet.

00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:29.580
Okay?

00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:40.640
So, well, on Tuesday, we'll continue with this and we'll stop going into matrices, equations, and the first component.

00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:42.380
So, we'll start with matrices of planes and so on.

00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:49.060
Meanwhile, have a good weekend and please start working on your problem sets so that you can ask lots of questions to your TAs on Monday.
