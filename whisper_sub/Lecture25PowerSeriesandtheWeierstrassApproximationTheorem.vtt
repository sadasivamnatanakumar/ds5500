WEBVTT

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.400
So at the end of last time, let me just restate the theorem

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:32.940
that we proved, which was the vyrastross m test, which I'll

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.820
state in brief reform now as the following.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:45.720
Suppose fj are a sequence of functions from some subset s of r.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:59.460
So that for all j, there exists non-negative number m subj such

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.540
that two things hold.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.720
First off, these m subj's dominate the f subj's.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.440
f subj of x is less than or equal to m subj.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.740
And two, these m subj's are summable.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:50.820
Then the conclusion is the sequence of partial sums converges uniformly.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.060
So there exists some function f from s to r so that the partial sums converge uniformly.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:09.720
So this is a sequence of functions built up by the fj's by just taking the sum of

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.080
the first j equals 1 to n.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.040
So for example, I kind of went through this last time.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:29.440
So example, if fj of x equals old frame, if fj of x is equal to 1, then it's equal to

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:35.640
1 cosine of 160 j x over 4 to the j.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.520
Then, let's say on r. So s is r.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.140
Then a couple of things.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.880
fj of x for all x is less than or equal to 4 to the minus j because cosine of whatever

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.840
you put into it is always bounded by 1.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:22.120
And since this is converges, it implies that the sum of the sum of the sum of the

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:35.640
series, which I'm writing this way, which you should think of as a limit of functions.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:49.020
Of the partial sums, which are functions, converges uniformly on r. Not only that, this

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.100
function defined by I take x, I stick it into here, is continuous because last time,

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.480
we proved that the uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.780
This function here is the uniform limit of the partial sums, which is just finitely

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.720
many cosines of things, so that's continuous.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:17.180
This gives another proof of one of the things we did by hand when we spoke about different

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:25.160
probability, namely that this function that we considered was continuous.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:35.920
So let's go back to power series, which was our original motivation.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:00.100
So I'm going to be saying that a series, so let me, again, make this perfectly clear.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:12.980
When I say, if you like, make this a definition, or really this is just, I was using this terminology

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:18.060
up there in that theorem, and when I was talking about this example afterwards, but when

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:23.700
I say a series involving functions converges uniformly, I mean the partial sums converge

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:42.960
uniformly. So, means there is just a function f, so it's going to be a function f, so it's

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:56.480
going to be a function f, such that, and all of these are from S to R as well, such

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:07.360
that, just so that there's no ambiguity. So if I have a sequence of functions f sub j,

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.560
and I form their series, and I say that converges uniformly, that means there exists

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:19.220
some function f, so that the sequence of partial sums, these are now functions, converges

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:26.240
uniformly to the function f. That's what power series are, right? They're expressions

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:32.680
involving a free variable x, and therefore you can think of them as a series involving

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:42.960
functions. So let me just state the following theorem about when we have uniform convergence.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:07:02.660
So, let's suppose we have a power series, and I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say,

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:17.240
with radius of convergence, rho, which I will recall, is defined to be the limit as j goes

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:30.760
to infinity, a j, 1 over j, inverse. If this limit is 0, we say that the radius of convergence

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:36.140
is infinity. So if this is a finite number, this is a meaningful expression, if this

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:49.020
is 0, then this is shorthand for saying the radius of convergence is infinity. So let's

00:07:49.020 --> 00:08:00.600
assume this is, then as long as I stay strictly inside the radius of convergence, I have uniform

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:17.720
convergence. This is the statement of the theorem, then for all, r and 0 rho, this power series

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:30.740
now thought of as a series of functions of x converges, and this is the number of x,

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:45.080
uniformly on x, not minus r, x, not plus r. So the picture is, we have some radius

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:54.600
of convergence, x, not, x, not plus rho, x, not minus rho. If we take any closed interval

00:08:54.600 --> 00:09:02.060
basically inside of that, strictly inside of that interval, then we have uniform convergence

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:20.200
of the power series. So we'll prove this using the Vierstrauss M test. So let r be in

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:36.240
0 rho, then for all j. So the Vierstrauss M test is for j equals starting from 1 and going

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:40.220
to infinity, but you don't have to, just like for series, we don't have to start at 1,

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:50.180
it can start at 0. So for all j, union 0, we have to be in the same direction as the

00:09:50.200 --> 00:10:02.620
one, what do we have? What are we writing? And for all x, in this interval, where we want

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:10.620
to show uniform convergence, we have that, this function a sub j, x minus x, not to the

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:18.760
j, in absolute value, what is this bounded by? This is bounded by absolute value of a j,

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:28.600
and then j, and because x is in this interval, its distance to x not is less than or equal

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:43.780
to r, so r to the j. So this will be my mj that I'll use for the Vierstrauss M test. Let

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:52.580
me put that in parentheses, because I may not use that mj. So these individual functions,

00:10:52.840 --> 00:11:05.420
just polynomials are bounded by this number for each j, and now I want to see if the series

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:13.760
of involving these numbers converges. So let me apply the number of x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x,

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:33.500
x, the root test, we have, this is equal to, now this r to the j to the 1 over j, just

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:42.700
becomes r, and it can just come out of this limit, and I pick up a to the 1 over j, and

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:45.640
This is equal to 1 over rho.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:56.180
So this is equal to, if you like, I can put r over rho,

00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:01.460
as long as if rho is less than infinity,

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.000
meaning if the radius of convergence

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.440
is less than infinity and 0.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.020
And what do we notice?

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:11.580
Now, r is less than rho.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:17.460
r is coming from the closed interval 0 up to the rho,

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:18.500
not including rho.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:22.060
So this number, so this is always less than 1,

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.820
but this number is always less than 1,

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.540
2, as long as r is less than rho, which

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:31.360
implies that the series sum from j equals 0

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:37.620
to infinity of a j, r to the j converges.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:44.580
So now we have the sequence of functions, the polynomials

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:46.780
that we use to build up our power series.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:51.760
Each of them bounded by these numbers, a sub j,

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.600
absolute value times r to the j.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.380
And these numbers are summable.

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:58.440
The series converges.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:11.120
So by the virus truss M test, this implies

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:22.800
that the power series converges uniformly on this interval.

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:30.540
OK.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:34.560
All right.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:39.200
So as long as we stay within, strictly within inside the radius

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.380
of convergence, we have uniform convergence

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:43.260
of the power series.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.800
And therefore, using the theorems that we proved before,

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:56.560
we can differentiate and integrate term by term, the power series.

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:05.340
So which follows immediately from this previous theorem,

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:09.040
and then what we proved last time, which I'll state now.

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:36.560
Now the power series with radius of convergence rho

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:38.220
positive.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:44.060
Let me write it this way.

00:14:51.880 --> 00:15:00.280
And the first is we're all c inside x not minus r, x not

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:06.100
plus r, the function given by the power series.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.520
Which I'm not going to call this f or anything.

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:12.440
I'm just going to refer to the power series directly.

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:19.940
This is differentiable at c.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.500
And to compute the derivative, you can just do it term by term,

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:33.540
meaning I can take the derivative inside by dx of x.

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:41.300
So this is a value of j equals 0 to infinity, a sub j

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.400
evaluated at x equals c.

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:53.540
This is equal to simply differentiating term by term.

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:35.840
And number two, for all a, b, for all a less than b,

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:37.840
less than x not plus rho.

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:42.300
So here I'm sticking to strictly with inside the radius of

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:42.740
convergence.

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:47.680
There's the x not plus rho, x not minus rho.

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:51.380
And so now I'm going to integrate over some interval inside.

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:55.540
Then I can integrate term by term.

00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:02.640
The integral from a to b, sum from j equals 0 to infinity of

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:11.440
a sub j, x minus x not j dx equals, and I'll just write it

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.640
this way, sum from j equals 0 to infinity of,

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:21.860
okay.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:31.720
Okay.

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:35.940
And in fact, let me just to really emphasize that we're

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:36.980
interchanging limits here.

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:43.300
Let me instead write this equivalently as sum from j equals

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:55.500
0 to infinity of j by dx of a sub j, x minus x not j

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.380
evaluated at x equals c.

00:17:59.520 --> 00:17:59.820
Okay.

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:05.360
So for power series, I can interchange the limits, okay.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.780
The limit being taken at derivative and the sum, I can

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:12.960
interchange and then I can also interchange the integration

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:17.760
and the sum, as long as I stay within the radius of

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:18.140
convergence.

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:19.560
Okay.

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:21.400
And this statement here is a point wise.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:23.700
Okay.

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:26.380
So let's see why one is the case.

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:30.700
Two follows immediately from what we've proven.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.620
And so this previous theorem and the theorem we have about

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:36.560
integration and uniform convergence.

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.300
So what about one?

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:50.560
So first off, we know we have uniform convergence of the

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:54.720
series strictly inside of the radius of convergence.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:19:01.880
So how about we need to check to see if the formal derivative also

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:06.000
has radius of convergence as well, equal to rho.

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:19.960
So I claim that the radius convergence of the derivatives,

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:31.080
which equals, I can write it this way.

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:31.080


00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:43.460
No.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:55.480
So the derivative of this guy is j times a sub j times x minus

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.000
x not to the j minus 1.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000
So just shifting indices is equal to times j plus 1 times

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.500
x minus x not to the j.

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:18.000
So our claim is that this power series here has radius of

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:22.940
convergence equal to rho, the original radius of convergence.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.220
So rho is the radius of convergence of, why didn't I come

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:27.460
over here? I still had a board left.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:28.480
Sorry about that.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:34.440
The original power series has radius of convergence rho.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:39.540
What we need to show to prove part one is that the radius of

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:44.000
convergence of the derivatives of taking the derivatives inside

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.900
also has radius of convergence rho.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:50.880
Because then this would imply that this power series,

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:54.220
which is the derivative of that one, converges uniformly on

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:58.220
the same set. So then we have uniform convergence of the

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:02.220
power series and uniform convergence of the derivative of the

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:04.880
power series. So by the theorem we proved in the last lecture,

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:12.940
we would have that the derivative of the power series equals

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.600
the power series of the derivatives.

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.840
So I'm just going to focus on this claim.

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:26.260
And this again just follows from what we know about

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:35.800
limits. And so we compute that if we take the limit as j

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:39.840
goes to infinity, now these are the coefficients for the

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:47.950
new power series. So aj plus 1, j plus 1,

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:57.450
raised to the 1 over j. This is equal to limit j goes to

00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:06.990
infinity of a sub j plus 1, now raised to the 1 over j plus

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:21.510
1, j plus 1, 1 over j plus 1, now all raised to j plus 1

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:28.690
over j. Now this was a special limit that we looked at last

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:36.070
time. This, the limit as j goes to, not last time, but way

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:39.130
back when we were looking at sequences, the limit as j goes to

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:48.170
infinity of this guy is 1. So this in fact equals limit as j goes

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:53.090
to infinity. This goes to 1, this goes to 1, so you can actually

00:22:53.090 --> 00:23:06.050
say this converges to 1 as well. So this equals to the j plus 1,

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:14.930
over j. Now strictly speaking you would have to,

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:21.650
okay, so this thing also converges to, what does it converge to?

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:26.870
This, remember, is, so where do we have it?

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:30.810
Do we still have it up here? So it's way over there,

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:34.410
so let me recall that the radius of convergence, rho,

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:38.870
let me put it inverse to here, this is equal to the limit as,

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:44.430
let me put a k goes to infinity of a sub k 1 over k.

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:52.070
So this is, the exponents converging to 1, this is converging to

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:58.210
rho inverse again, so I get rho inverse to the 1.

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:06.230
So therefore, this is supposed to be the radius 1 over the radius

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:11.210
of convergence to the differentiated power series, which

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:21.650
implies the differentiated power series.

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:41.890
j is 1 over this limit, 1 over that limit, which we

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:47.950
computed is to be is 1 over rho, which is the original radius of

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:52.770
convergence, okay? So all this to say is that the radius of

00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:55.550
convergence of the differentiated power series, the formally

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:59.210
differentiated power series is the same as the radius of

00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:02.130
convergence of the original power series, okay?

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:06.310
And therefore, you have uniform convergence of the derivatives,

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:10.070
wherever you have uniform convergence of the original power series.

00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:13.190
And therefore, by the theorem we proved last time,

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:22.170
since both the derivatives and, so since the power series,

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:26.030
in the derivative of the power series converges uniformly on the

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:33.990
same set, the power series, the infinism, so this guy is

00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:37.570
actually differentiable and the derivative of the power series is

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:40.550
the power series of the derivatives, okay?

00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:43.890
But you can iterate this, right?

00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:49.750
Because I now have this power series with radius of convergence

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:52.430
equal to the radius of convergence of the original.

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:57.450
And then I can take a derivative of that and show that's as the same

00:25:57.450 --> 00:25:59.730
radius of convergence as the original.

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:06.110
So let me just leave this as a remark and not stated as a

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:06.410
theorem.

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:19.150
Interrating can prove that I want the kth derivative of the power

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:47.250
series, so on, so let me say, all x in here, the kth derivative of the

00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:54.610
power series of differentiating term by term.

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:05.910
So this holds for, okay, equals 1, 2, and so on.

00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:15.450
And so in particular, if I evaluate at x0, this tells me that k

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:24.410
factorial a sub k is equal to the derivative of this function,

00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:28.310
which is the, which you get out when you stick x into this power

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.850
series.

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:33.490
Okay?

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:45.390
And you can interpret this, although we never called them Taylor

00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:51.490
series, you know, as a statement that every power series is the

00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:54.670
Taylor series of a function, okay?

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:57.490
At least in this setting that we're looking at.

00:28:01.090 --> 00:28:01.690
Okay.

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:17.730
So we've answered pretty definitively, at least for the scope of this

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:27.470
class, when we can interchange limits, we can do that as long as we have

00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:34.470
the, you know, the function, continuous functions or function

00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:41.410
and its derivative, but there are more powerful statements out

00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:43.910
there that one can make, especially when it comes to integration.

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:53.590
This is why, you know, essentially, why a different theory of

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:56.150
integration was created or one reason why.

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:08.930
But, you know, hopefully, if I see some of you in 18102, which is

00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:12.470
what I'm teaching next semester, we'll get into that further when we

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:14.330
just discuss LeBague integration.

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:19.770
That was thought of because somehow Riemann integration is not

00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:23.750
complete, the same way that rational numbers are not complete.

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:29.850
Kind of Riemann integration is not complete.

00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:35.050
LeBague integration is complete in a certain sense, I'm being very vague

00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:35.730
here for a reason.

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:42.430
So I'm just giving you a, you know, where you can go with this.

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:52.710
What the next step is is, you know, at least improving when can you interchange

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:58.790
two limits is, you know, really a topic that's fundamental to the study of,

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:01.350
in the study of LeBague integration.

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:08.030
You have much more powerful theorems there than you do here, which allows you to

00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:13.090
improve, you know, interesting results, and especially about Fourier

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:19.770
series. In fact, you know, if I had more time, we would apply, in fact, some

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:22.510
of the stuff that we've done here, we could apply to the study of Fourier

00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:27.670
series, but maybe we'll do that in 18102.

00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:40.830
Okay, so I want to now prove the last theorem of the class, which is also

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:49.290
due to the Godfather. So, you know, when we had these power series, so these are

00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:50.850
defining, you know, functions.

00:30:56.590 --> 00:31:00.890
Very special types of functions, what are called analytic.

00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:09.570
They are, by definition, essentially, the limit of polynomials, right?

00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:16.410
They're the limit of these finite sums of a sub j's times x minus x zero,

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:24.270
raised to the j power, that's a polynomial. So, for analytic functions,

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:30.110
which are these functions, equal to power series, they are the limits of polynomials.

00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:38.090
But that's a pretty small class of functions, analytic functions.

00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:51.090
But the virus straws proved this very interesting result that actually something

00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:56.450
like this is true for all continuous functions. So, roughly speaking,

00:31:57.050 --> 00:32:04.610
virus straws proved that basically every continuous function is in some sense

00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:09.330
that it's almost a polynomial. Just as we saw for these analytic functions,

00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:15.670
meaning defined by power series, they are very close to being, at least within

00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:21.210
their radius of convergence, a polynomial. In fact, this is true for all continuous

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:26.450
functions, that not necessarily equal to a power series, but every continuous

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:33.630
function is almost a polynomial. And in what sense do I mean that?

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:37.430
So, this is a virus straws' approximation theorem,

00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:56.150
which states the following. If f is in continuous function,

00:32:56.410 --> 00:33:01.070
and on the unit intervals say you can make it a, b, just by rescaling the variables.

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:05.530
But I'll just state it for continuous functions on the unit interval.

00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:21.170
Then there exists a sequence, polynomials,

00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:37.630
p sub n of x, such that p sub n converges to f uniformly on 0,1.

00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:49.190
And so, in this sense, every continuous function is well approximated by polynomials.

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:55.930
So, every continuous function is close to being a polynomial.

00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:10.510
Okay, so I need to first prove a couple of things that will be needed.

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:17.430
So, first off, I'm only going to look at only, so let me make some remarks before we go to the proof.

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:26.430
So, we're putting the proof on hold now. So, let me just make a remark.

00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:32.450
I don't necessarily need to prove this statement for every f, just for certain f,

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:35.050
and then for every f, we'll follow from this special class.

00:34:35.970 --> 00:34:48.110
So, we only need to consider, we'll only consider the case,

00:34:51.690 --> 00:34:56.750
f of 0 equals 0, and f of 1 equals 0.

00:34:56.870 --> 00:34:58.370
So, f is 0 at the end points.

00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:03.470
While we're doing this, is so that we can extend f to a continuous function outside of the unit interval,

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:05.690
by just setting it equal to 0.

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:11.350
Okay, and so, let's suppose we've proven this special case,

00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:12.750
and we look at the general case.

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:29.630
Then, if I take any continuous function now,

00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:37.290
what do we know that there exists sequence of polynomials,

00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:55.130
piece of n, such that these polynomials, piece of n,

00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:10.090
so this function here, if I look at it,

00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:14.930
it's a continuous function on 0,1, because I'm just modifying it by constants,

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:23.210
and then times x, and then at f of 1, I get f of 1 minus f of 0 minus f of 1 minus f of 0,

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:28.230
so I get 0, and at 0, I get f of 0 minus 0, f of 0 is 0,

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:31.010
minus 0 times something I don't care, equals 0.

00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:35.550
So, there exists polynomials converging to this function now.

00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:40.750
Right, if we've been able to prove the case just for f of 0 equals 0,

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:41.870
and f of 1 equals 0.

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:46.150
So, uniformly.

00:36:47.230 --> 00:37:03.130
And therefore, the polynomials given by piece of n of x plus now x times f of 1 minus f of 0 plus.

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:07.410
So, this is still, if this was a polynomial,

00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:12.770
so is adding this to it, that's still a polynomial converges to,

00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:19.210
at tilde of x uniformly, and this again, this is still a polynomial.

00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:32.350
So, the whole point of this remark is that we only need to consider the case f of 0 equals 0,

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:33.630
and f of 1 equals 0.

00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:39.070
And we're going to do that just so that we can extend f to a continuous function outside the interval.

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:43.010
All right.

00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:55.250
All right.

00:37:55.250 --> 00:38:04.290
Now, the way we're going to build these polynomials that converge to f is by what's called an approximation to the identity.

00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:11.670
Really, I guess you could think of it as an approximation to the delta function,

00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:13.310
and I'll explain that in just a minute.

00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:23.510
So, for all n, a natural number, define c sub n.

00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:32.670
This will be the integral from minus 1 to 1 of 1 minus x squared raised to the n dx, 1 over,

00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:36.230
and then q sub n of x.

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:42.590
This is going to be equal to c sub n times 1 minus x squared raised to the n.

00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:50.150
Then a few simple consequences are.

00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:57.890
So, first off, this is the integral of a function which is not negative,

00:38:58.050 --> 00:39:00.750
but it's positive at plenty of places between minus 1 and 1,

00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:05.230
and you proved in the homework that this means that the integral has to be positive.

00:39:06.350 --> 00:39:17.610
Then the first is, for all n, natural number, for all x and 0, 1.

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:21.210
So, the first two of these observations are very clear.

00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:28.210
q n of x is greater than, so, minus 1 to 1.

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:35.090
q n of x is bigger than or equal to 0, so it's just c sub n,

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:38.410
which is a positive number times 1 minus x squared, x squared.

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:42.850
So, x is between minus 1 and 1, and therefore 1 minus x squared is always not negative.

00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:51.730
2 is, this is also pretty clear.

00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:58.610
The integral from minus 1 to 1 of q sub n of x dx equals 1.

00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:06.010
Now, why is this clear?

00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:11.690
Because this is equal to the integral of 1 minus x squared raised to the n times c to the n,

00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:12.650
or c sub n.

00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:17.970
But c sub n is the inverse of that integral, so we should just pick up 1.

00:40:18.570 --> 00:40:30.290
Now, the third and less trivial thing, which is important, is that for all delta and 0, 1,

00:40:33.810 --> 00:40:43.010
this function q sub n, I mean this is just a polynomial, converges to 0 uniformly on

00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:56.910
the set, delta is less than, so, x such that delta is bigger than or equal to the absolute value of x.

00:40:58.410 --> 00:41:01.850
No, delta is less than or equal to the absolute value of x is less than or equal to 1.

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:11.430
So, in other words, here's minus 1, 1, 0, delta, minus delta.

00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:19.390
If I look in these regions, so in the, if you like the union of those two intervals,

00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:27.570
then q sub n, this polynomial, is converging to 0 uniformly as n goes to infinity on,

00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:32.330
on the union of these two intervals.

00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:34.070
Okay?

00:41:34.450 --> 00:41:36.370
So, what is the picture of what's going on?

00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:37.930
What do these q sub n's look like?

00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:46.170
So, here's minus 1, here's 1.

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:53.170
So, kind of the first one, you know, looks like some constant times 1 minus x squared, so,

00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:56.250
there's the first one.

00:41:58.130 --> 00:42:07.910
And then, as n keeps getting bigger and bigger, you know, this is 0 at higher and higher order at 1 and minus 1,

00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:09.550
and getting pretty small near here.

00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:18.570
And, in fact, according to 3, if I take any interval around 0 and look outside of it,

00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:22.130
as n goes to infinity, q sub n is going to 0 uniformly.

00:42:22.350 --> 00:42:29.990
So, what it should look like is, maybe the next one, looks like that, and then further still,

00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:39.530
like that, so that, you know, if I look at the formula,

00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:47.170
look inside over here or over here, q sub n is going to 0 uniformly.

00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:54.770
So, what you should think of is that the q sub n's as n goes to infinity is something like a Dirac delta function,

00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:56.610
which is not exactly a function.

00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:00.410
Okay?

00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:07.090
So, again, so, let me re-emphasize that, and this is in quotes.

00:43:07.090 --> 00:43:28.030
You should think of q sub n, acts like delta function,

00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:38.690
and acts like centered at x equals 0.

00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:42.110
Okay? So, that's in quotes, because that is meaningless.

00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:46.610
But some of you have taken physics, know what it properties are of a delta function.

00:43:48.370 --> 00:43:53.950
And, you know, the integral is 1. It's somehow 0 everywhere away, except for the origin,

00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:57.290
and it's infinite there, but somehow it's integral 1.

00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:02.150
So, okay.

00:44:05.290 --> 00:44:12.390
So, these q sub n's will show form an approximation to the identity in a certain sense.

00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:14.170
But let me, let's prove these.

00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:25.650
Let's prove the only non-trivial one, which is 3, right?

00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:28.470
Number 1 and 2 are clear based on how they're defined.

00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:29.770
Okay?

00:44:33.310 --> 00:44:35.890
So, let's first estimate how big is this?

00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:39.770
So, this constant c sub n, we don't really know how, what it is explicitly.

00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:42.950
But let's compute at least a rough size of it.

00:44:47.830 --> 00:44:51.310
And then we'll use this to prove the third part.

00:44:53.030 --> 00:45:03.670
So, we have, we're all in a natural number, the following inequality,

00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:11.630
n x and minus 1, 1, 1 minus x squared raised to the n.

00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:15.630
This is greater than or equal to 1 minus n x squared.

00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:23.450
Okay? Now, this, if it's not, so it shouldn't be like, you know, hit you in the face,

00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:27.490
clear why this is true. But one way you can prove it is that if you look at the function,

00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:36.790
g of x equals 1 minus x squared, and so first off, this inequality is even an x.

00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:39.070
It doesn't matter if x is negative or positive.

00:45:39.350 --> 00:45:50.670
So, let's look at this function on 0, 1.

00:45:51.350 --> 00:45:52.730
Then what's the point?

00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:57.830
I look at g of 0, this is 0.

00:45:58.490 --> 00:46:07.790
And if I compute g prime of x, this is equal to n times 2x times what?

00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:14.530
Times 1 minus 1 minus x squared to the n minus 1.

00:46:15.310 --> 00:46:20.710
And this is always less than or equal to 1, this thing in parentheses.

00:46:21.370 --> 00:46:28.030
So, this thing is always bigger than or equal to 0 on 0, 1.

00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:33.050
So, on 0, 1, this function is increasing and its value at 0, 0.

00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:44.270
So, we get that, which is exactly what we wanted to prove.

00:46:45.830 --> 00:46:46.270
Okay?

00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:55.410
So, now we compute the size of c sub n.

00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:59.750
So, to do that, let me look at 1 over c sub n.

00:47:00.330 --> 00:47:05.070
If I want an upper bound on c sub n, I need to prove a lower bound on 1 over c sub n.

00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:10.090
So, let's take 1 over c sub n and find a lower bound for it.

00:47:10.730 --> 00:47:17.630
This is the integral from minus 1 to 1, of 1 minus x squared raised to the n, dx.

00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:30.750
Now, I can't remember if I made this a homework problem or not, but for even functions integrating over an interval even with respect to the origin.

00:47:30.930 --> 00:47:31.710
This is just twice.

00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:35.350
I mean, I'm sure you remember this from calculus.

00:47:35.350 --> 00:47:41.290
This is not hard to prove with what we know of the change of variables formula and so on.

00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:47.030
That this is equal to twice times the integral from 0 to 1 of 1 minus x squared raised to the n.

00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:49.690
Okay?

00:47:50.490 --> 00:47:55.050
Now, this is bigger than or equal to 2 times if I integrate to a certain point.

00:47:55.190 --> 00:48:02.290
This certain point is chosen so that I get a result in the n that's pretty, essentially.

00:48:16.530 --> 00:48:22.730
Now, this is where I replace this by the smaller thing, which is easy to integrate.

00:48:23.730 --> 00:48:33.230
So, this is greater than or equal to 2 and it grows 0, 1 over root n, 1 minus n, x squared dx.

00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:47.950
And I leave it to you to verify that with this choice at the end point what I get is 4 over 3 root n, 1 over root n.

00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:59.530
And therefore, so, and this is bigger than 1 over root n.

00:48:59.690 --> 00:49:05.170
So, I started with 1 over c sub n and I showed that it was bigger than 1 over root n.

00:49:05.850 --> 00:49:15.230
And therefore, c sub n is less than 1 over, as c sub n is less than the square root of n.

00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:16.390
Okay?

00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:23.490
Now, we'll use this to compute what we want.

00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:33.510
In fact, I mean, we really just needed to show that c sub n is bounded by some polynomial in n, but this will suffice.

00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:46.730
So, we now want to show, let delta be positive.

00:49:47.130 --> 00:49:56.790
We now want to show that c sub n converges uniformly to 0 on that set where the absolute value of x is less than or equal to 1 is bigger than or equal to delta.

00:49:58.970 --> 00:50:15.470
Now, we note that the following sequence converges to 0 that square root of n times 1 minus delta squared raised to the end.

00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:18.290
So, we should also put delta in 0, 1.

00:50:26.570 --> 00:50:32.390
So, this sequence here converges to 0 as n goes to infinity.

00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:36.270
Now, intuitively, why is this?

00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:42.150
This is because, you know, this is some number less than 1 raised to the nth power.

00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:49.990
You know, exponential always beats just a polynomial or, you know, a power of n.

00:50:51.250 --> 00:51:04.750
If you want to see exactly why this is, we could compute the limit as n goes to infinity of this sequence raised to 1 over n power.

00:51:06.010 --> 00:51:16.710
Then, this is equal to the limit as n goes to infinity of n to the 1 over n, 1 half, 1 minus delta squared.

00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:20.110
And this converges to 1. We prove that.

00:51:20.370 --> 00:51:23.510
And so, this equals 1 minus delta squared, which is less than 1.

00:51:24.330 --> 00:51:34.210
And we have this, you know, theorem from our section on sequences that says if this limit is less than 1,

00:51:34.210 --> 00:51:37.550
then the thing here converges to 0.

00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:45.110
You know, or you could interpret this as saying that the series with this as the individual terms converges.

00:51:45.590 --> 00:51:49.330
And therefore, the individual terms have to converge to 0.

00:51:50.050 --> 00:52:01.010
So, which implies limit as n goes to infinity equals 0.

00:52:02.470 --> 00:52:08.350
So, now we have this. And, you know, once we have this, we'll have what we want.

00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:16.090
So, we want to prove uniform convergence on that set.

00:52:16.290 --> 00:52:17.470
So, let epsilon be positive.

00:52:21.370 --> 00:52:26.250
Then, since this sequence converges to 0, there exists an m, a natural number.

00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:34.250
So, that for all n, bigger than or equal to m, square root of n times 1 minus delta squared,

00:52:34.990 --> 00:52:37.050
raised to the n, is less than epsilon.

00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:49.750
And, for all n, bigger than or equal to m, for all x, so that delta is between less than 1.

00:52:50.850 --> 00:52:51.830
We get that.

00:52:54.470 --> 00:53:00.770
Q sub n, so it's not negative, minus 0, an absolute value, that's just Q sub n of x.

00:53:05.110 --> 00:53:10.370
Basically, n, this is less than or equal to square root of n, that's for this guy.

00:53:10.890 --> 00:53:12.050
1 minus x squared.

00:53:13.810 --> 00:53:19.710
This is getting smaller as I get closer to 1, so it's biggest at delta.

00:53:23.310 --> 00:53:27.090
And, how we chose m is, this is less than epsilon.

00:53:28.610 --> 00:53:28.730
Okay?

00:53:35.370 --> 00:53:42.730
Okay, so, now we're ready for the proof of the virus-trust approximation theorem.

00:53:51.890 --> 00:54:07.110
So, suppose f is continuous function on 0, 1, f of 0 equals 0, f of 1 equals 0.

00:54:12.370 --> 00:54:13.110
Okay?

00:54:19.330 --> 00:54:30.690
So, you know, this polynomial here is very concentrated at, you know, at 0, so, well, first off.

00:54:30.690 --> 00:54:50.110
Suppose f, and it's continuous here, so, you can check that if it's 0 there, and I extend it to be 0 outside of 0, 1, this is still a continuous function.

00:54:50.110 --> 00:54:59.370
I'm just defining it this way because I want to write certain symbols in a little bit without specifying exactly where the bounds of the integration are.

00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:00.570
Okay?

00:55:01.590 --> 00:55:22.030
So, we extend f by 0 outside of 0, 1, and this function f is continuous function on the real number line.

00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:23.950
Okay?

00:55:25.770 --> 00:55:26.370
Okay?

00:55:29.950 --> 00:55:37.490
So, we define, now we're going to define this polynomial, sequence of polynomials, piece of n.

00:55:39.830 --> 00:55:50.990
This is going to be equal to the integral from 0 to 1 of f of t times q sub n of t minus x dt.

00:55:52.290 --> 00:56:06.170
And just to remind you, this is equal to the integral from 0 to 1 of f of t times c sub n, 1 minus x minus t squared raised to the n dt.

00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:24.370
Okay, so this is just, you know, c sub n times this thing, if you expand everything out, is just a, you know, using the binomial theorem, this is equal to j equals,

00:56:29.690 --> 00:56:31.950
I'm just going to put a sum here, meaning a finite sum.

00:56:31.950 --> 00:56:58.290
Some numbers, a sub j, and times x, you know, to the j, times t to the, oh, just some finite numbers, a jk times x to the j, t to the k.

00:56:58.290 --> 00:57:06.850
All right? All I'm saying is, if you expand this out using the binomial theorem, you get this polynomial and x of j t sub k.

00:57:07.310 --> 00:57:12.310
Okay? And then this is getting integrated against f of t.

00:57:13.350 --> 00:57:14.150
All right?

00:57:15.550 --> 00:57:17.970
dt. And so this is in fact a polynomial.

00:57:19.570 --> 00:57:31.830
I'll give you, you know, it, okay, so let's write this out and be precise just so that you're convinced that it's a polynomial.

00:57:31.830 --> 00:57:36.690
This is equal to the integral from zero to one of f of t times c sub n.

00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:46.890
Now we use the binomial theorem. This is equal to j zero to n, n choose j.

00:57:46.890 --> 00:58:07.330
And then minus x minus t squared raised to the n minus j, or I could put j to j.

00:58:07.330 --> 00:58:07.330


00:58:13.970 --> 00:58:20.270
Okay? And then dt.

00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:28.650
I'm not sure if this is even helping or anything, but just so that you see this is actually polynomial.

00:58:28.650 --> 00:58:33.390
f of t c sub n sum from j equals zero to n.

00:58:34.190 --> 00:58:42.510
And now sum from k equals zero to two j and choose j minus one to the j.

00:58:46.010 --> 00:58:56.550
Now two j choose k minus t to the k times x to the two j minus k.

00:59:00.730 --> 00:59:02.990
Okay? And then dt.

00:59:03.530 --> 00:59:10.490
So I have all this junk integrated dt and then this is x to the two j minus k, so that just pops out.

00:59:10.490 --> 00:59:12.410
So this is a polynomial.

00:59:13.370 --> 00:59:21.730
I mean, this is a polynomial, but then when it integrates against f of t, this x to the two j minus k comes out of the integral.

00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:35.290
And I get that times just all, you know, this becomes a sum of terms with x to the two j minus k outside this integral times f of t times integrated against minus two to the k.

00:59:35.890 --> 00:59:44.270
All right. I think I said more than I needed to there, but so the point is p sub n of x is a polynomial.

00:59:46.530 --> 00:59:48.870
Now, we can write this slightly differently.

00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:59.470
So p sub n of x, this is equal to,

01:00:03.730 --> 01:00:06.050
this as it was before.

01:00:07.790 --> 01:00:11.250
Now this, we changed variables and is equal to,

01:00:14.290 --> 01:00:21.490
so we do use substitution, now where u is equal to x minus t, and then I'm going to, you know, change the,

01:00:30.530 --> 01:00:32.870
dt, so what I did here was a change of variables.

01:00:42.910 --> 01:00:47.150
I said, u is equal to x minus t.

01:00:48.290 --> 01:00:50.570
I guess you could, if you like, t minus x.

01:00:52.650 --> 01:00:56.510
And then I just recalled, and then I just called u t then again.

01:01:05.170 --> 01:01:11.310
So I'm eventually looking at these polynomials only in the interval zero one.

01:01:12.730 --> 01:01:26.850
Okay, so this is what it looks like, but now, you know, this f of x plus t for t between minus x and one minus x,

01:01:27.130 --> 01:01:34.890
it's actually zero outside of that, so I can extend the integration to minus one and one.

01:01:35.950 --> 01:01:46.430
Again, with the understanding that I've extended f to be zero outside of zero one.

01:01:48.970 --> 01:02:10.630
So since f, y equals zero, or let me write it this way, since f of x plus t equals zero for t not n minus x and one minus x.

01:02:11.850 --> 01:02:21.150
Okay, so that was a lot of, you know, explaining for some stuff, but here, let me get to the point.

01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:25.050
What is piece of n really?

01:02:25.270 --> 01:02:29.930
So why should you expect this to converge to f?

01:02:30.450 --> 01:02:32.170
So this is a little discussion.

01:02:35.390 --> 01:02:42.350
So I said that, and this is for those who understood my comment about delta functions.

01:02:44.810 --> 01:02:52.250
You know, in Q sub n is very concentrated at zero, at t equals zero.

01:02:52.730 --> 01:03:07.170
Okay, so this, you should think of as being approximately like a delta function at t.

01:03:07.830 --> 01:03:11.590
If you don't know what a delta function is, or never heard of it, then forget the rest of this remark.

01:03:11.590 --> 01:03:15.710
But, and then I'll say something.

01:03:15.870 --> 01:03:36.730
So Q sub n kind of looks like a delta function, and therefore minus one of x plus t, q n of t, t t, should look more and more like f of x plus t, delta of t, dt.

01:03:36.730 --> 01:03:49.610
And what we know about a direct delta function is that when you integrate them against a function, you just pick up the function evaluated at zero, which is...

01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:58.290
Okay, so, you know, that's kind of why you expect it.

01:03:58.290 --> 01:04:06.410
I mean, if you look back at this picture of what the Q n's are looking like, they're concentrating more and more at zero.

01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:17.230
So all of the contribution to this integral here, which defines these polynomials, is happening at t equals zero.

01:04:17.730 --> 01:04:20.290
At t equals zero, I just pick up f of x.

01:04:21.290 --> 01:04:33.130
Okay? So that's why you should kind of expect these polynomials to converge to back to the function.

01:04:34.390 --> 01:04:34.550
Okay?

01:04:37.710 --> 01:04:39.350
So I think I can finish on this board.

01:04:53.050 --> 01:04:57.170
So this is a picture you should have seared in your mind. This is what the Q sub n's look like.

01:04:58.630 --> 01:05:02.010
That they're concentrating all of their mass right at the origin.

01:05:02.590 --> 01:05:09.050
And therefore, I should just pick up f at the point x.

01:05:09.310 --> 01:05:16.150
Since this is concentrating at the origin t equals zero, I should just pick up f of x plus t at t equals zero, which is f of x.

01:05:17.550 --> 01:05:17.830
Okay?

01:05:19.110 --> 01:05:26.510
And y f of x plus t, not some constant times f of x plus t. That's because the integral of Q sub n's is one.

01:05:28.890 --> 01:05:34.070
Okay. So now let's prove that the p-ins converge to f uniformly.

01:05:47.830 --> 01:05:48.090
All right?

01:05:54.010 --> 01:05:56.170
Okay. So let epsilon be positive.

01:06:00.830 --> 01:06:08.910
Since f is a continuous function on a closed and bounded interval, we know that it's uniformly continuous.

01:06:15.290 --> 01:06:21.570
And therefore, there exists delta positive such that.

01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:26.110
How am I writing this here?

01:06:31.650 --> 01:06:48.310
Such that if, sorry, this way for all zy so that z minus y less than delta, we get that f of z minus f of y is.

01:07:01.530 --> 01:07:04.250
Actually, we don't need, okay, so I mean, we don't need.

01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:11.070
So much, so much about f, but we'll go with this anyways.

01:07:13.630 --> 01:07:17.670
We really just know, okay, nevermind, I'll stop.

01:07:18.210 --> 01:07:23.690
So we know that f is uniformly continuous, so there exists a delta, so that I have this.

01:07:23.690 --> 01:07:28.270
Yeah, so less than epsilon over two.

01:07:29.690 --> 01:07:35.370
Okay. So z and y are then delta to each other, then f of z and f of y, no matter what z and y are,

01:07:35.570 --> 01:07:37.110
are then epsilon over two of each other.

01:07:38.170 --> 01:07:51.350
Okay. Now, since f is continuous, it has a maximum on this interval.

01:07:53.070 --> 01:07:58.750
Well, I should say since f is a continuous function, it has both a max and a min on this interval,

01:07:58.910 --> 01:08:07.570
and therefore there exists some number c such that.

01:08:15.730 --> 01:08:19.030
f of x is bounded by c for all x and 0, 1.

01:08:22.190 --> 01:08:28.950
Okay. All right. So now I have this delta coming from the uniform continuity of f,

01:08:29.130 --> 01:08:32.230
I have this c coming from the fact that it's bounded on this interval,

01:08:32.230 --> 01:08:36.930
and now I'm going to choose my m for the uniform convergence of the polynomials,

01:08:37.150 --> 01:08:47.610
just depending on these pieces of input, then as we showed since square root of n,

01:08:48.370 --> 01:08:57.450
1 minus delta square and converges to 0, this implies there exists an m, natural number,

01:08:58.210 --> 01:09:01.910
so that for all, and bigger than or equal to m,

01:09:04.750 --> 01:09:17.690
I get that square root of n, 1 minus delta square, raise to the n, is less than epsilon over 8c.

01:09:19.330 --> 01:09:23.630
Okay. All right.

01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:29.490
I claim this m works, that for all n bigger than or equal to m, for all x and 0, 1,

01:09:29.610 --> 01:09:42.470
p, n minus f is less than epsilon, and for all n bigger than or equal to m, for all x and 0, 1.

01:09:44.210 --> 01:09:52.930
If we look at piece of n of x minus f of x, we're going to use that,

01:09:53.650 --> 01:09:58.430
you know, this thing is an approximation to the identity, meaning it's, you know,

01:10:01.510 --> 01:10:04.510
essentially that it satisfies those three properties that I wrote a minute ago.

01:10:04.510 --> 01:10:21.650
So this is equal to integral from minus 1 to 1 of f of x plus t times qn of t dt minus f of x.

01:10:24.710 --> 01:10:28.790
What's the integral from minus 1 to 1 of qn sub t, that's equal to 1.

01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:36.130
So f of x is at times, so this is, you know, all of analysis is writing 1 or 0 in a certain way.

01:10:38.370 --> 01:10:49.670
Not all, but, so I can write this as f of x plus t, now minus f of x times qn of t.

01:10:53.430 --> 01:11:00.290
So, again, because the integral of q sub n of t equals 1, so again, if you just expand this out,

01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:04.770
this is f of x and integrating with respect to t, so I just pick up what I had before.

01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:19.650
Now by the triangle inequality for integrals, this is less than or equal to the integral from minus 1 to 1 of f of x plus t minus f of x times the absolute value of x times the integral of t equals 1.

01:11:19.650 --> 01:11:27.790
So, this is the value of q sub n of t, but since q sub n of t is non-negative, that's just q sub n of t.

01:11:29.470 --> 01:11:32.930
Now I'm going to split this integral up into two parts.

01:11:35.150 --> 01:12:02.310
This is equal to a part where t is less than or equal to, so it should minus delta, delta, f of x plus t minus f of x, q sub n of t dt, and then plus the other part, which I can write as,

01:12:02.310 --> 01:12:10.810
so it's a union of the two intervals now away from delta and out to 1.

01:12:13.950 --> 01:12:23.910
So, it's the sum of the integral over these two intervals, which I'm going to write as the integral over delta less than or equal to t is less than or equal to 1.

01:12:24.910 --> 01:12:32.650
And, times q n of t.

01:12:38.370 --> 01:12:50.470
Now, t is between minus delta and delta, and therefore x plus t minus x, and absolute value is less than delta.

01:12:53.530 --> 01:13:10.430
So, in this integral here, I want to note that if t is in this interval here, x plus t minus x equals t is less than delta in this here.

01:13:10.430 --> 01:13:29.450
So, since this guy, minus this guy, is less than delta in absolute value, I can use this uniform continuity part to say that this is less than epsilon over 2 q n of t dt.

01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:44.230
Plus, now, the absolute value of this guy is less than, by the triangle inequality, is less than or equal to the sum of the absolute values, which is less than or equal to 2 c.

01:13:44.230 --> 01:13:50.810
So, 1 and then 2 c.

01:13:54.490 --> 01:14:03.990
Because that's bounded by c, that's bounded by c. So, the absolute value of the difference is less than or equal to the sum of the absolute values, which is bounded by each of those bounded by c.

01:14:09.070 --> 01:14:21.810
Now, this is less than epsilon over 2 integral from, if I just integrate the whole thing from minus 1 to 1, that just gives me 1 plus 2 c times q n of t.

01:14:21.810 --> 01:14:27.870
So, the only thing on this interval is, again, so I should put delta there.

01:14:29.970 --> 01:14:38.630
2 c c sub n, 1 minus delta squared, raise to the n dt.

01:14:46.010 --> 01:15:05.510
So, there's no t here, so this is equal to epsilon over 2, because this integral is 1 plus this c sub n, remember, is less than the square root of n times 1 minus delta squared.

01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:12.410
And times the integral over this region dt, which I can make bigger by going from minus 1 to 1, that gives me 2.

01:15:12.870 --> 01:15:19.290
And this is equal to epsilon over 2 plus 4 c square root of n, 1 minus delta squared n.

01:15:20.510 --> 01:15:27.250
And this is less than epsilon over 2 plus epsilon over 2 equals epsilon.

01:15:27.630 --> 01:15:28.970
I think I have one minute to spare.

01:15:29.450 --> 01:15:34.050
So, this was quite an experience teaching to an empty room.

01:15:34.730 --> 01:15:36.690
I hope you did get something out of this class.

01:15:39.390 --> 01:15:41.210
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to meet a lot of you.

01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:49.990
And that's one of the best parts about teaching and being able to see you grasp in real time what I'm talking about.

01:15:50.190 --> 01:15:56.370
So, hopefully, this nightmare will end soon, and we'll get to see each other in the future.

01:16:04.050 --> 01:16:05.970
You
