00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.620
OK, so we are going to continue looking

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:33.020
at what happens when we have non-independent variables.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.000
So I'm afraid we don't take deliveries during class time.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.280
Sorry.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.700
OK, please take a seat.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.300
Thanks.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:51.740
Oh.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.640
No, thanks.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:55.720
Thanks.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.940
OK.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.660
OK, so Jason, you please claim your package at the end of lecture.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.460
So last time we saw how to use Lagrange multipliers

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.900
to find the minimum or maximum of a function of several variables

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.420
when the variables are not independent.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.440
And today we are going to try to figure out more about relations

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.660
between variables and how to handle functions that depend

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.660
on several variables when they're related.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.720
So just to give you an example, in physics very often,

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.680
you have functions that depend on pressure, volume,

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.340
and temperature, where pressure, volume, and temperature

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.280
are actually not independent, but they're related, say,

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.900
by pv equals nRt.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.940
So of course, then you can substitute and express the function

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.520
in terms of two of them only, but very often it's

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.680
convenient to keep all three.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.040
But then we have to figure out what are the rates of change

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.360
of p and v with respect to t, with respect to each other,

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.260
the rate of change of f with respect to these variables,

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.900
and so on.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.240
So we have to figure out what we mean

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.480
by partial derivatives again.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:31.060
So, I mean, marginally, let's say just for the sake

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.240
of notation, I'm going to think of a function of three

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.220
variables xyz where the variables are related by some

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.940
equation, but they will put a form in the form g of xyz

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:43.880
equals some constant.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.360
So that's the kind of, same kind of setup as we had last time,

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.740
except now we are not just looking for minima and maxima,

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.520
we are trying to understand partial derivatives.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:07.040
So the first observation is that if xyz are related,

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.280
then that means, in principle, we could solve for one of them

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.220
and express it as a function of the two others.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.100
So, in particular, can we understand even without solving,

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.660
maybe we cannot solve, can we understand how the variables

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:23.840
are related to each other?

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.660
So, for example, z, you can think of z as a function of x and y.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:40.940
So, we can ask ourselves what are the rates of change of z

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.280
with respect to x, keeping y constant,

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.360
or with respect to y, keeping x constant.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.600
And of course, if we can solve, then we know from your

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.600
office and then we can compute these guys,

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:55.980
but what if we can't solve?

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:04.380
So, how do we find these things without solving?

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.760
Well, so let's do an example.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:16.940
So, let's say that my relation is x squared plus yz plus z cube

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:17.620
equals 8.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:26.160
And let's say that I'm looking near the point xyz equals 2,

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.840
3, 1.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.560
So, let me check, 2 squared plus 3 times 1 plus 1 cubed is indeed 8.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.140
But now, if I change x and y a little bit, how does z change?

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.680
Well, of course, I could solve for z in here.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.140
It's a cubic equation.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.920
There is actually a formula, but that formula is quite

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.500
complicated.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:46.920
We actually don't want to do that.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.920
That's an easier way.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.580
So, how can we do it?

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.000
Well, let's look at the differential.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.120
Of this constraint quantity.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.340
So, if we call this g, let's look at dg.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.000
So, well, what's the differential of this?

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:29.520
So, differential of x squared is 2x dx plus, I think,

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.040
there's a z dy.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.240
There's a y dz and there's also a free z squared.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.140
You can get this either by implicit differentiation

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:46.140
and the product rule, or you can get this just by putting here

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.620
and here the partial derivatives of this with respect

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:50.620
to x, y, and z.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.940
Any questions about how I got this?

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:58.440
No, okay.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.360
So, now, what do I do with this?

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.880
Well, this represents somehow variations of g.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.600
But, well, I've set this thing equal to 8,

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.180
and 8 is a constant.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.000
So, it doesn't change.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.040
So, in fact, well, we can set this to zero,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.840
because, well, they call this g,

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:41.320
then g equals 8 is constant, that means we set dg equal to zero.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:43.340


00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.260
So, now, let's just plug in some values at this point

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.720
that tells us, well, so if x equals 2, that's 4 dx,

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:05.620
plus z is 1, so dy, plus y plus free z squared

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.960
should be 6 dz equals 0.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:15.780
And now, this equation here tells us about a relation

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.160
between the changes in x, y, and z, near that point.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.620
It tells us how, if you change x and y,

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:25.380
well, how z will change, or it tells you, actually,

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.620
anything you might want to know about the relations

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:28.480
between these variables.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.240
So, for example, you can move dz to that side,

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.580
and then express dz in terms of dx and dy,

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.860
or you can move dy to that side,

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.280
and express dy in terms of dx and dz, and so on.

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:42.480
It tells you, at the level of derivatives,

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.720
how each of the variables depends on the two of us.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:52.220
Okay, so just to clarify this,

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:59.100
if we want to view z as a function of x and y,

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:04.060
then what we will do is we'll just move the dz

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:07.940
to the other side, and it will tell us dz equals

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:13.600
minus 1 over 6 times 4 dx plus dy.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:22.140
And so, that should tell you that partial z

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:26.260
over partial x is minus 4 over 6,

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:30.140
well, that's minus 2 thirds, and partial z

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:34.440
over partial y is going to be minus 1, 6.

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.700
Another way to think about this,

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:44.980
when we compute partial z over partial x,

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.900
that means that, actually, we keep y constant.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:54.060
Okay, let me actually add some subtitles here.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.000
So here, that means we keep y constant,

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:03.200
and so if we keep y constant, another way to think about it

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:07.060
is we set dy to zero.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:08.960
We set dy equals zero.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:13.900
So if we do that, we get dx equals negative 4, 6 dx.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.320
That tells us the rate of change of z with respect to x.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:28.300
Here, we set x constant, so that means we set dx equal to zero.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:33.920
And if we set dx equal to zero, then we have dz equals negative 1, 6th of dy,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.540
that tells us the rate of change of z with respect to y.

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.140
Okay, any questions about that?

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:46.840
No?

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:49.800
What? Yes?

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:56.020
Can you explain why we have run dt when dx and dy into partial?

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.800
Yes, okay, let me explain that again.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.880
So we found an expression for dz in terms of dx and dy,

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:08.040
that means that this thing is the total differential of z

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:09.000
and z is the total differential of z,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.200
so that means that we have run dt as a function of x and y.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.840
Okay, and so the coefficients of dx and dy are the partial.

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.100
Or another way to think about it,

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.460
if you want to know partial z partial x,

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:22.200
it means you set y to be constant.

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.860
Setting y to be constant means that you will put zero

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:27.320
in the place of dy.

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:31.580
So you'll be left with dz equals minus 4, 6 dx.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:35.780
And that will give you the rate of change of z with respect to x

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:37.160
when you keep y constant.

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:38.420


00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.000
So various ways to think about this,

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.300
but hopefully it makes sense.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.000
Okay.

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:58.200
So how do we think about this in general?

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.620
Well, if we know that g of x, y, z equals constant,

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:24.900
then dg, which is g sub x dx plus g sub y dy plus g sub z dz,

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.680
should be set equal to zero.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:28.960
Okay.

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:35.340
And now we can solve for whichever variable we want to express

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:36.340
in terms of the others.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:42.520
So, for example, if we care about z as a function of x and y,

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:47.980
it's...

00:11:53.120 --> 00:12:01.240
We'll get that dz is negative g sub x of g sub z dx,

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:08.440
sorry, minus g sub y of g sub z dy.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.700
And so if we want partial z,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.120
then we can solve for other partial x.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:24.360
Well, so one way is just to say that's going to be the coefficient

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.540
of dx in here, or just to write down the other way.

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:31.360
We are setting y equals constant.

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:36.920
So that means we set dy equal to zero.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:39.120
Okay.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:47.220
And then we get dz equals negative g sub x of our g sub z dx.

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:55.120
So that means partial z of our partial x is minus gx over gz.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.580
And see, that's a very counter-intuitive formula,

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.900
because you have this minus sign that you somehow probably

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:05.960
couldn't have seen come, you know, if you hadn't actually derived things

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:06.380
this way.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:12.780
I mean, it's pretty surprising to see that minus sign come out of nowhere

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:13.940
the first time you see it.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:18.860
Okay.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:25.400
So now we know how to find the rate of change of constrained variables

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.620
with respect to each other.

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:30.680
You can apply the same to find, you know,

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.920
if you want partial x, partial y or any of them, you can do it.

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.200
Any questions so far?

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:41.120
No?

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:44.900
Okay.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:55.420
So before we proceed further, I should probably expose some

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:57.580
problem with the notations that we have so far.

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.620
So let me try to get you a bit confused.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:03.240
Okay.

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:06.780
So let's take a very simple example.

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:11.900
Let's say I have a function f of xy equals x plus y.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:13.260
Okay.

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:15.100
So far, it doesn't sound very confusing.

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:21.620
And then I can write partial f of our partial x.

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:24.940
And I think you all know how to compute it.

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:27.460
It's going to be dressed one.

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:30.100
Okay. So far we are pretty happy.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.140
Now, let's do a change of variables.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:42.700
Let's set x equals u and y equals u plus v.

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.700
Okay. It's not a very complicated change of variables.

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:48.400
But let's do it.

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:53.140
Then f in terms of u and v.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.320
Well.

00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:02.500
So f, remember, was x plus y becomes u plus u plus v.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:08.360
What's partial f of our partial u?

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:13.540
It's two.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.840
So x and u are the same thing.

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:20.820
Partial f of our partial x and partial f of our partial u.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.220
Well, unless you believe that one equals two,

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:26.000
they are really not the same thing.

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:26.460


00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:26.460


00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:31.920
So that's an interesting slightly strange phenomenon.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.520
x equals u.

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:41.900
But partial f, partial x is not the same as partial f, partial u.

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:51.620
So how do we get rid of this contradiction?

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:57.440
Well, we have to think a bit more about what these notations mean.

00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:58.220


00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:00.960
So when we write partial f of our partial x,

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:05.800
it means that we are varying x, keeping y constant.

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:09.580
When we write partial f of our partial u,

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:11.960
it means we are varying u, keeping v constant.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:15.160
So varying u or varying x is the same thing.

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:19.180
But keeping v constant or keeping y constant are not the same thing.

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:22.920
If I keep y constant, then when I change x,

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:27.400
so when I change u, then v will also have to change

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:28.720
so that their sum stays the same.

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:31.000
Or if you prefer the other way around,

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:33.260
when I do this one, I keep v constant.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.420
If I keep v constant and I change u, then y will change.

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:37.700
It won't be constant.

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:44.300
So that means, well, life looked quite nice and easy

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:45.100
with these notations.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:50.160
But what's dangerous about them is they're not making explicit

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.260
what it is exactly, but we are keeping constant.

00:16:55.540 --> 00:17:01.700
Okay, so just to write things.

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:07.040
So here we change u and x by the same thing,

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:10.260
but we keep y constant.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.940
While here we change u, which is still the same thing as x,

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:23.760
but what we keep constant is v,

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:28.240
or in terms of x and y, that's y minus x constant.

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.340
And that's y, not the same.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.980
So whenever there's any risk of confusion,

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:39.080
so not in the cases that we had before,

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.720
because in what we've done until now,

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:43.040
we didn't really have any problem.

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.500
But in a situation like this,

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:49.040
to clarify things, we'll actually say explicitly

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:52.500
what it is that we want to keep constant.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.080
Okay, so what's going to be our new notation?

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:12.360
Well, so it's not particularly pleasant,

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.640
because it uses now a subscript not to indicate

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:16.700
what you're differentiating,

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.360
but rather what you're holding constant.

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:21.620
So that's quite a conflict of notation

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:23.400
with what we had before.

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:27.340
I think I can safely blame it on physicists or chemists.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:28.060
So...

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:34.900
Okay, so this one means we keep y constant.

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:44.040
And partial f of a partial u with v health constant,

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:47.940
similarly.

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:54.180
Okay, so now what happens is we no longer have any contradiction.

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:57.420
We have partial f of our partial x

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:06.060
with y constant is different from partial f of our partial f.

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.960
So we have partial x with v constant,

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:11.440
which is the same as partial f of our partial u

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:12.900
with v constant.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.060
Okay, so this guy is one,

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.340
and this guy is two.

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.780
So now we can safely use the fact that x equals u

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.560
if we are keeping track of what is actually health constant.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:38.260
Okay, so now that's going to be particularly important

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.420
when we have variables that are related.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.700
Because let's say now that I have a function

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.740
that depends on x, y, and z, but x, y, and z are related.

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.960
Then it means that, you know,

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:55.420
if I look at, say, x and y as my independent variables

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:58.020
and z as a function of x and y,

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:00.800
then it means that when I do partial say,

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.720
with respect to x, I will hold y constant,

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.660
but I will let z vary as a function of x and y.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.740
Or I could do it the other way around.

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:12.560
I could very x keep z constant

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.640
and let y be a function of x and z.

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.800
And so I will need to use this kind of notation

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.100
to indicate which one I mean.

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:30.300
Okay, any questions?

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:34.600
No?

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:39.280
All right, so let's try to do an example

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.820
where we have a function that depends on variables

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:42.500
that are related.

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:48.820
Okay, so I don't want to do one with pv equals an RT

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:51.540
because probably, I mean, if you've seen it,

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:53.060
then you've seen too much of it.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:57.100
And if you haven't seen it, then maybe it's not the best example.

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.820
So let's do a geometric example.

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:05.820
Okay, so let's look at the array of the triangle.

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:15.380
So let's say I have a triangle,

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:19.820
and my variables will be the sides A and B,

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:22.460
and the angle here theta.

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:25.860
Okay, so what's the array of this triangle?

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.900
Well, it's base times height of R2,

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:33.080
so it's 1 half of the base is A,

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:36.400
and the height is B sine theta.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:42.860
Okay, so that's a function of A, B, and theta.

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:48.360
Now, let's say, actually, there's a relation between A, B, and theta

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:49.400
that I didn't tell you about.

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:55.720
Namely, actually, I want to assume that it's a right triangle.

00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:05.380
Okay, so let's now assume it's a right triangle

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:13.680
with, let's say, the hypotenuse is B.

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:17.760
So we have a right angle here, actually.

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:21.880
So A is here, B is here, theta is here.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:28.960
So saying that it's a right triangle is the same thing as saying that A equals B cosine theta.

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:32.140
Okay, so that's our constraint.

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.580
That's the relation between A, B, and theta.

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:44.640
And this is a function of A, B, and theta.

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:54.900
Okay, let's say that we want to understand how the area depends on theta.

00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:01.080
What's the rate of change of the area of this triangle with respect to theta?

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:04.160
So I claim there's various answers.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:09.760
I can think of at least three possible answers.

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:53.780
So what can we possibly mean by the rate of change of A with respect to theta?

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:58.440
So these are all things that we might want to call partial A, partial theta.

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:04.440
But of course we'll have to actually use different notations to distinguish them.

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:15.160
So the first way that we actually already know about is if we just forget about the fact that the variables are related.

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:23.260
Okay, so if we just think of little A, B, and theta as independent variables,

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:26.160
and we just change theta keeping A and B constant.

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:50.100
So that's exactly what we meant by partial A, partial theta.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.640
We are not putting any constraint.

00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:04.360
So just to use some new notation that would be the rate of change of A with respect to theta,

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:06.280
keeping A and B fixed at the same time.

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:10.560
Of course if we are keeping A and B fixed and we are changing theta,

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:14.800
it means we completely ignore this property of being a right triangle.

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:21.000
So in fact it corresponds to changing the area by changing the angle, keeping these lengths fixed.

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:23.400
And of course we lose the right angle.

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:30.500
When we rotate this side here, then the angle doesn't stay the right angle.

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:33.140
And that one we know how to compute.

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:38.220
Because it's the one we've been computing all along.

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:43.000
So that means we keep A and B fixed.

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:53.740
And then, so let's see, what's the derivative of A with respect to theta?

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:58.420
I guess it's 1 half AB cosine theta.

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:03.880
Okay, that one we know.

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:06.860
Any questions?

00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:14.020
No? Okay, the two other guys will be more interesting.

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:20.440
So far I'm not really doing anything with my constraint.

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:24.640
Let's say that actually I do want to keep a right angle.

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:28.680
Then when I change theta, there's two options.

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.540
One is I keep A constant.

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:33.880
And then of course B will have to change.

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:38.980
Because if this width stays the same, then when I change theta, the height increases.

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:40.440
And then this side length increases.

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:46.660
The other option is I change the angle, keeping B constant.

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:49.000
So actually this side stays the same length.

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:50.880
But then A has to become a bit shorter.

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:56.860
And of course the area will change in different ways depending on what I do.

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:03.620
So that's why I say we have very different answers.

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:11.340
So the next one is keep, I thought which one I said first.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.780
Let's say keep A constant.

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:22.160
And that means that B will change.

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:28.420
B is going to be some function of A and theta.

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.540
Well in fact here we know what the function is.

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:34.240
Because we can solve the constraint.

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.760
Namely B is A over cosine theta.

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:41.200
But we don't actually need to know that.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.120
So that the triangle.

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:55.700
So that we keep a right angle.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:09.040
And so the name we will have for this is partial A of a partial theta with A held constant.

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:17.860
And the fact that I'm not putting B in my subscript there means that actually B will be a dependent variable.

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:21.300
It changes in whatever way it has to change.

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:26.380
So that when theta changes A stays the same.

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:29.140
Well B changes so that we keep a right angle.

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:44.900
And the third guy is the one where we actually keep B constant.

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:53.200
And now A we think of A as a function of B and theta.

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:56.240
And it changes so that we keep a right angle.

00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:00.580
So actually as a function of B and theta it's given over.

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:03.620
It's given over A equals B cosine theta.

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:12.080
And so this guy is called partial A of a partial theta with B held constant.

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:18.600
So we've just defined them.

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.560
We don't know yet how to compute these things.

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:21.800
That's what we're going to do now.

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.960
But it's the definition and what these things mean.

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.120
Is that clear to everyone?

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:30.460
Yes.

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:31.180
Okay.

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:33.600
Yes.

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:41.560
Okay. So the second answer again.

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:49.960
So one way to ask ourselves how does the area depend on theta is to say well.

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:59.380
So theta will actually look at the area of a right triangle as a function of A and theta only by solving for B.

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:05.880
And then we'll change theta, keep A constant and ask how does the area change?

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:13.760
So when we do that, when we change theta and keep A the same, then B has to change so that it stays a right triangle.

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:18.980
So that this relation still holds, that requires us to change B.

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:29.500
So when we write partial A of a partial theta with A constant, it means that actually B will be the dependent variable.

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.080
It depends on A and theta.

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:42.580
And so the area depends on theta not only because theta is in the formula, but also because B changes and B is in the formula.

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:46.360
Yes.

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:50.600
So we can say that A constant will be keep theta constant.

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:54.160
No, no, we don't keep theta constant with very theta.

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:57.940
The goal is to see how things change when I change theta by a little bit.

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:09.100
So if I change theta a little bit in this one, if I change theta a little bit and I keep A the same, then B has to change also in some way so that it stays a right triangle.

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:15.440
And then because theta and B change, that causes the area to change.

00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:18.260
So maybe I should explain that again.

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:20.860
So theta changes.

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:24.340
A is constant.

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:28.660
But we have the constraint.

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:31.440
A equals B cosine theta.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.040
That means that B changes.

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:40.240
And then the question is how does A change?

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:47.800
Well, it will change in part because theta changes and in part because B changes.

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:52.100
But we want to know how it depends on theta in this situation.

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:53.880
Yes.

00:31:54.740 --> 00:32:01.860
Why is it a large situation where a theta increases B and A are not constant, but they try to do this too.

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:03.960
That's a very good question.

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:06.860
So what about I don't keep A and B constant?

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:09.800
Well, then there's too many choices.

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:12.820
So I have to decide actually how I'm going to change things.

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:20.680
See, if I just say I have this relation, that means I have two independent variables left, whichever two of the three I want.

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:25.460
But I still have to specify two of them to say exactly which triangle I mean.

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:33.540
So I cannot ask myself just how will it change if I change theta and do random things with A and B?

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:35.140
It depends what I do with A and B.

00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:41.440
Of course, I could choose to change them simultaneously, but then I have to specify how exactly I'm going to do that.

00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:52.060
Yes, if you wanted to, indeed, we could also change things in such a way that the third side remains constant.

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:55.740
And that would be yet a different way to attack the problem.

00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:59.300
I mean, we don't have a good notation for this here because we didn't give it a name.

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:06.080
But, yeah, I mean, we could call this guy C and then we'd have a different formula and so on.

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:12.820
So I mean, I'm not looking at it for simplicity, but you could have many more.

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:33.080
I mean, in general, you will want, you know, once you have a set of nice natural variables, you will want to look mostly at situations where one of the variable changes, some of them are held fixed and then some dependent variable does whatever it must so that the constraint keeps holding.

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:39.260
Okay, so let's try to compute one of them.

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:42.720
Let's say I decide that we'll compute this one.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.660
Okay, let's see how we can compute partial A, partial theta with A held fixed.

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:32.280
Okay, so let's try to compute partial A, partial theta with A held constant.

00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:37.000
So let's see three different ways of doing that.

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:43.720
So let me start with method zero.

00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:51.100
Okay, it's not a real method. That's why I'm not giving it a positive number.

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:58.400
So that one is just we solve for B and we remove B from the formulas.

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:08.180
Okay, so here it works well because we know how to solve for B, but I'm not considering this to be a real method because in general, we don't know how to do that.

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:17.820
I mean, if we use, you know, at the beginning I had this relation that was an equation of degree three, you don't really want to solve your equation for the dependent variable usually.

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:19.440
Here we can.

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:27.160
So solve for B and substitute.

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:33.980
So how do we do that?

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:38.580
Well, the constraint is A equals B cosine theta.

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:44.700
That means B is A over cosine theta.

00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:50.080
So I'm a few know that as a second theta, that's the same.

00:35:56.100 --> 00:36:01.000
And now if we express the area in terms of A and theta only.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:19.380
A is one half of AB cosine, sorry, AB sine theta is now one half of A squared sine theta over cosine theta.

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:24.860
Or if you prefer, one half of A square tangent theta.

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:37.460
Well, now that it's only a function of A and theta, I know what it means to take the partial derivative with respect to theta, keeping A constant.

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:38.660
I know how to do it.

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:53.220
So partial A over partial theta with A held constant.

00:36:54.800 --> 00:37:02.420
Well, if A is a constant then I get this one half A squared coming out times what's the derivative of tangent?

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:04.100
Second squared.

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:07.780
Very good.

00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:12.340
If you're European and you've never heard of second, that's one of our cosine.

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:19.060
And if you know the derivative has one plus tangent squared, that's the same thing and it's also correct.

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:23.420
Okay, so that's one way of doing it.

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:29.640
But as I've already said, it doesn't get us very far if we don't know how to solve for B.

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:33.920
I mean, we really used the fact that we can solve for B and get rid of it.

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.380
So there's two systematic methods.

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:52.020
And let's say the basic rule is that you should give both of them a chance.

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:58.000
You should see which one you prefer and you should be able to use one of the other on the exam.

00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:03.300
Okay, most likely you will actually have a choice between one of the other.

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:06.800
It will be up to you to decide which one you want to use.

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:10.720
But you cannot use solving and substitution.

00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:11.440
That's not fair.

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:18.820
Okay, so the first one is to use differentials.

00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:29.880
By the way, in the notes, they're also method one and method two.

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:32.200
I'm not promising that I have the same one.

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:34.520
I might have one and two switched.

00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:35.640
It doesn't really matter.

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:39.500
So how do we do things using differentials?

00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:45.000
Well, first we know that we want to keep a fixed.

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:53.200
And that means that we'll set dA equal to zero.

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:59.680
Okay, the second thing that we want to do is we want to look at the constraint.

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:05.320
The constraint is a equals b cosine theta.

00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:07.480
And we want to differentiate that.

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:11.120
Well, differentiate the left hand side.

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:12.640
You get dA.

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:16.620
And differentiate the right hand side.

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:21.140
As a function of b and theta, you could get, well, how many db's?

00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:23.660
Well, that's the rate of change we've respect to b.

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:30.360
That's cosine theta db minus b sine theta d theta.

00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:35.060
That's the product rule applied to b times cosine theta.

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:51.120
So, well, now if we have the constraint that's relating dA, dA, dA,

00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:52.080
dB and d theta.

00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:54.080
So that's actually what we did.

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:58.480
That's the same sort of thing as what we did at the beginning when we related dx,

00:39:58.640 --> 00:39:59.260
dy and dz.

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:00.740
That's really the same thing.

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:03.740
Except now our variables are a, b and theta.

00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:06.660
Now we know that also we're keeping a fixed.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:08.400
So actually we set this equal to zero.

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:18.400
So we have zero equals dA equals cosine theta db minus b sine theta d theta.

00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:23.960
That means that actually we know how to solve for dB.

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:34.900
So cosine theta db equals b sine theta d theta.

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:42.040
Or db is b tangent theta d theta.

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:49.980
So in fact what we found, if you want, is the rate of change of b with respect to theta.

00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:52.100
Why do we care?

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:58.460
Well, we care because let's look now at dA.

00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:01.800
The function that we want to look at.

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:10.220
So the function is a equals one half AB sine theta.

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:13.000
Well then dA.

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:18.240
So we have to use the product rule carefully or we use the partials.

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:21.360
So the coefficient of d little a will be partial respect to little a.

00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:34.080
But so one half b sine theta dA plus coefficient of dB will be one half a sine theta dB.

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:43.380
Plus coefficient of d theta will be one half AB cosine theta d theta.

00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:48.420
But now what do I do with that?

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:51.320
Well first I said a is constant.

00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:53.180
So dA is zero.

00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:58.420
Second, well actually we don't like b at all.

00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:02.620
We want to view a as a function of theta.

00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:12.200
So well maybe we actually want to use this formula for dB that we found in here.

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:19.760
And then we'll be left only with d-faters, which is what we want.

00:42:54.280 --> 00:43:09.020
So if we plug this one into that one, we get dA equals one half a sine theta times b tension theta.

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:19.640
d theta plus one half AB cosine theta d theta.

00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:38.820
And if we collect these things together, we get one half of AB times sine theta times tension theta plus cosine theta d theta.

00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:45.300
And if you know your trick then you will see that this is sine square over cosine plus cosine square over cosine.

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:47.520
That's the same as second theta.

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:52.960
So now you have expressed dA as something times d theta.

00:43:54.640 --> 00:44:06.640
Well that coefficient is the rate of change of a with respect to theta with the understanding that we are keeping a fixed and letting b vary as a dependent variable.

00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:36.060
Not enough space.

00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:40.240
But now this tells us how a depends on little a, little b and theta.

00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:46.360
Well we know actually we want to keep little a constant. So we set this to be zero.

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:52.180
Feta, well we are very happy because we want to express things in terms of theta.

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:56.500
dB we want to get rid of. How do we get rid of dB?

00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:03.780
Well we do that by figuring out how b depends on theta when a is fixed.

00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:09.860
And we do that by differentiating the constraint equation and setting dA equal to zero.

00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:12.560
Okay so.

00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:22.820
The I guess to summarize the method.

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:35.340
We wrote dA in terms of dA dB d theta.

00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:44.380
Then we say that a is constant means we set dA equal zero.

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:56.280
And the third thing is that because well we differentiate the constraint.

00:45:56.280 --> 00:46:08.120
And we can solve for dB in terms of d theta.

00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:23.500
And then we plug into dA and we get the answer.

00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:38.220
So here's another method to do the same thing differently.

00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:43.180
So we can use the chain rule with dependent variables.

00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:46.740
So what does the chain rule tell us?

00:46:55.320 --> 00:47:02.840
The formula for a, we respect to theta holding a constant.

00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:09.900
So I claim well what does the chain rule tell us?

00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:17.780
It tells us that well when we change things, a changes because of the changes in the variables.

00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:24.520
So part of it is that a depends on theta and theta changes.

00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:32.280
How fast does theta change? Well you could call that the rate of change of theta with respect to theta with a constant.

00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:36.740
But of course how fast does theta depend on itself? The answer is one.

00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:39.120
So that's pretty easy.

00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:53.120
Plus then we have this, the partial derivative, the formal partial derivative of a with respect to little a times the rate of change of a in our situation.

00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:59.540
Well how does little a change if a is constant? Well it doesn't change.

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:14.580
And then there's a sub little b, the formal partial derivative times, sorry, the rate of change of b.

00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:21.840
And how do we find this one? Well here we have to use the constraint.

00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:34.640
And we can find this one from the constraint as we've seen at the beginning either by differentiating the constraint or by using the chain rule on the constraint.

00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:48.460
So of course the calculations are exactly the same. See this is the same formula as the one over there just dividing everything by partial theta and with subscripts little a.

00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:56.280
But if you, you know, if it's easier for you to think about it this way then that's also valid.

00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:08.500
Okay so tomorrow we're going to review for the test. So I'm going to tell you a bit more about this also as we go over one practice problem on that.
