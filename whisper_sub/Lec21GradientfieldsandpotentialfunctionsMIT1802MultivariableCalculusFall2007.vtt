00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.060
OK, so we were looking at vector fields.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:48.100
And last time, so last time we saw that if a vector field

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.800
happens to be a gradient field,

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:09.580
then the line integral can be computed actually by taking the change in value of a potential

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.880
between the endpoint and the starting point of a curve.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:27.800
So if we have a curve c from a point p0 to a point p1, then the line integral for work

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.860
depends only on the end points and not on the actual path we choose.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.240
So we say that the line integral is path independent.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:53.520
And we also said that the vector field is conservative because of conservation of energy,

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.560
which tells you if you start at a point and you come back to the same point, then you

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.860
haven't gotten any work out of that force.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:14.080
So if we have a closed curve, then the line integral for work is just 0.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.340
And basically, we say that these properties are equivalent to being a gradient field

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.820
or being path independent or being conservative.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.480
And what I promised to you is that today we would see a criterion to decide whether a vector field

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.400
is a gradient field or not and how to find the potential function if it is a gradient field.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.540
OK, so that's the topic for today.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:55.840
So question is testing whether a given vector field, let's say m and n, components,

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.800
is a gradient field.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.180
So for that, well, let's start with an observation.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.180
So say that it is a gradient field.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:31.460
So that means that the first component of the field is just the partial of f with respect

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:32.760
to some to the variable x.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.700
And the second component is the partial of f with respect to y.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.420
And now we have seen an interesting property of the second partial derivatives of the

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.380
function, which is if you take the partial derivative first with respect to x, then with

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.860
respect to y, or first with respect to y, then with respect to x, you get the same thing.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.920
So we know f sub x, y equals f sub y x.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.600
And that means m sub y equals n sub x.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.540
OK, so if you have a gradient field, then it should have this property.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.180
You take the y component, take the derivative of respect to x, take the x component, differentiate

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.080
with respect to y, you should get the same answer.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.360
And that's important to know, so I'm going to put that in the box.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.640
It's a broken box.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.600
OK, so the claim that I want to make is that there's a converse of sorts.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.760
This is actually basically all we need to check.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.680
So.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.760


00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.840
What's the name of it?

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:18.260
OK, so conversely, if, so I'm going to put here a condition and m y equals n x, then

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:20.840
f is a gradient field.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.720
So what's the condition that I need to put here?

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.240
Well, we'll see a more precise version of that next week.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:55.240
But for now, let's just say if our vector field is defined and defraniable everywhere in

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.620
the plane.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.600
OK, so we need actually a vector field that's well defined everywhere.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.200
You're not allowed to have somehow places where it's not well defined.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.660
Otherwise, actually, you have a counter example on your problem set this week.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.600
If you look at the last problem on the problem set this week, it gives you a vector field

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.240
that satisfies this condition everywhere where it's defined.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.700
But actually, there's a point where it's not defined.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:29.380
And that causes it actually to somehow, I mean, everything that I'm going to say today

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.880
breaks down for that example because of that.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.180
So I mean, we'll shed more light on this a bit later with the notion of simply connected

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.260
regions and so on.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.480
But for now, let's just say if it's defined everywhere and satisfies this criterion,

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:46.820
then it's a gradient field.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:56.400
So if you ignore that technical condition, being a gradient field means essentially the

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.600
same thing as having this probability.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.240
So that's what we need to check.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.620
OK, so let's look at an example.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:23.640
Well, one vector field that we've been looking at a lot was minus yi plus xj.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:31.960
Remember, that was the vector field that looked like rotation at unit speed.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.560
So I think last time we already decided that this guy should not be allowed to be a gradient

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:43.240
field and should not be conservative because if we integrate on the unit circle, then

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.640
we'll get a positive answer.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:49.340
But let's check that indeed it fails our test.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.420
So, well, let's call this guy m.

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:56.500
Let's call this guy n.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:06.180
Then if you look at partial m, partial y, well, that's going to be negative 1.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:10.780
If you take partial n, partial x, that's going to be 1.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:12.320
These are not the same.

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:16.860
So, indeed, this is not a gradient field.

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:33.940
OK, any questions about that?

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:36.740
Yes?

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:59.720
OK, so your question is if I have that property m sub y equals n sub x only in a certain

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:05.440
domain, in a certain part of a plane, for some values of x and y, can I conclude these

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:05.720
things?

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:10.640
That's a gradient field in that part of a plane and conservative and so on.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.380
The answer for now is in general no.

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:19.820
When we spend a bit more time on it, maybe I should move that up.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:24.800
Maybe we'll talk about it later this week instead of when I planned.

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:30.080
There's a notion of what it means for a region to be without holes.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:34.820
Basically, if you have that property in a region that doesn't have any holes inside

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.100
it, then things will work.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:42.740
The problem comes from your vector field satisfying this criterion in a region that has a hole

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:43.180
in it.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:49.140
Then what you don't know is whether your potential is actually well defined and takes the

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.360
same value when you move all around the hole.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.460
It might come back to take a different value.

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:57.980
If you look carefully and think hard about the example on the problem set, that's exactly

00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:58.700
what happens there.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:04.140
Again, I will say more about that later.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.400
For now, we basically need our function to be.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:15.580
I should still say, if you have this property for a vector field that's not quite defined

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.340
everywhere, you're more than welcome.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:22.760
You should probably still try to look for potential using the methods that we'll see, but something

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:23.700
might go wrong later.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.300
You might end up with a potential that's not well defined.

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.100
Okay, let's do another example.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:48.300
Let's say that I give you this vector field.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:02.160
The question is, you know, so this A here is a number.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:08.360
The question is, for which value of A is this going to be possibly a gradient?

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.940
If you have your flashcards, then that's a good time to use them to vote.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.380
Assuming that number is small enough to be made with.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.040
Okay, so let's try to think about it.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:28.740
So we want to call this guy M. We want to call that guy N.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:34.460
And we want to test M sub Y versus N sub X.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:39.640
I don't see anyone.

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:40.760
Oh, yeah.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.580
I see people doing it with their hands, and that works very well.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:57.600
Okay, so the question is sorry, for which value of A is this gradient?

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:07.760
Yeah, okay, so I see various people with a correct answer.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.120
And yes, okay.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.380
That's a strange answer on the...

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:17.380
But yeah, I see...

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:18.280
Okay, that's a good answer.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:22.220
Okay, so the vote seems to be for A equals 8.

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:37.600
And let's see, well, if I take M sub Y, that is going to be just AX.

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:44.920
And sub X, that is 8X, so I would like A equals 8.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.180
But anyway, so when you set these two equal to each other,

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.320
they really have to be equal everywhere, right?

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.620
So you don't want to somehow solve for X or anything like that.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:59.120
You just want these expressions in terms of X and Y to be the same quantities.

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:03.800
You know, I mean, you can't say, well, if X equals 0, they're always equal.

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:05.940
Yeah, that's true, but that's not what we are asking.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:10.340
Okay.

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:17.500
So now we come to the next stage of, you know, the next logical question.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.660
Let's say that we've passed the test.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:22.460
So we've put A equals 18 here.

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:24.840
So now it should be a potential...

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:25.940
Sorry, it should be a gradient field.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:28.820
The question is, how do we find the potential?

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:31.720
So that becomes 8 from now on.

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:37.860
The question is, how do we find the function which has this as gradient?

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:40.700
So one option is to try to guess.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.160
And actually quite often you will succeed that way,

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:47.540
but that's not a valid method on next week's test.

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:51.600
So we're going to see two different systematic methods.

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:59.340
And you should be using one of these because guessing doesn't always work.

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:04.660
And actually, you know, I can come up with examples where if you try to guess,

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:06.480
you will surely fail.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:10.720
I can come up with trick once, but I don't want to put that on the test, but still.

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:19.640
So the next stage is finding the potential.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:32.640
And let me just emphasize, we can only do that if...

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.180
You know, step one was successful.

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:37.640
If we don't have...

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:42.140
You know, if we have a vector field that cannot possibly be a gradient,

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.300
then we shouldn't try to look for a potential.

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:49.420
It's kind of obvious, but it's probably worth pointing out.

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:53.000
So there's two methods.

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:58.680
And the first method that we'll see is by computing line integrals.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.100
So let's see how that works.

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:20.060
So let's say, let's, you know, I start...

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:26.460
I take some path that starts at the origin or actually anywhere you want,

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:28.580
but let's take the origin. That's my favorite point.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.500
And let's go to a point.

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:35.280
We've coordinates X1 and Y1.

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.880
And let's take my favorite curve.

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:48.060
And let's compute the line integral of that field along the work done along the curve.

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:57.240
Well, by the fundamental theorem, that should be equal to the value of the potential at the end point,

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:00.040
minus the value at the origin.

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:09.940
Well, so that means I can actually write F of X1, Y1 equals bless you.

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:21.200
Equals that line integral plus the value at the origin,

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.200
and that's just, you know, a constant.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.880
We don't know what it is.

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.420
And actually, we can choose what it is.

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:32.540
Because if you have a potential, you know, say that you have some potential function,

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:35.780
and let's say that you add one to it, it's still a potential function.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.460
Adding one doesn't change your gradient.

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:40.260
You can even add 18 or any number of it you want.

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.620
So this is just going to be an integration constant.

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.920
You know, it's the same thing as in one variable calculus.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:51.120
When you take the anti-derivative of a function, it's only defined up to adding a constant.

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:55.180
So we have this integration constant, but apart from that,

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:58.600
we know that we should be able to get our potential from this.

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:03.180
And this we can compute using the definition of the line integral.

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:06.040
Because we know, well, we don't know what little F is,

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.220
but we know what the vector field is.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:09.440
So we can compute that.

00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:12.460
Well, of course, to do the calculation,

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:15.840
we probably don't want to use this kind of path.

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:20.040
I mean, you know, if that's your favorite path, then that's fine.

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:23.380
But it's not very easy to compute the line integral along this,

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:26.220
especially since I didn't tell you what the definition is.

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:30.880
So, you know, there's easier favorite paths to have.

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:35.200
For example, you can go on a straight line from the origin to that point,

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:36.460
but it would be slightly easier.

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:38.480
But in fact, it's even easier.

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:43.340
The easiest of all, probably, is to just go first along the x-axis

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:49.760
to x10, and then go up parallel to the y-axis.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:51.420
Why is that easy?

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:54.500
Well, that's because when we do the line integral, you know,

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:58.340
it becomes mdx plus mdy, and then on each of these pieces,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.700
one half just goes away because x or y is constant.

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:11.680
So, let's try to use that method on our example.

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:31.980
Okay.

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:35.240
Okay.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:40.920
Okay.

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:46.160
So, let's see that I'm going to integrate.

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:47.540
Sorry.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:48.480
Okay.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:48.880
I'll get that in the brief.

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:49.720
Two.

00:18:55.560 --> 00:19:01.160
Okay. So, let's see that I want to go along this path from the origin.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:07.060
First along the x-axis to x10, then vertically to x1, y1.

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:19.800
And so, I want to compute the line integral along that curve.

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.700
So, let's say I want to do it for this vector field.

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.940
I want to find the potential for this vector field.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:36.080
So, here, okay, let me copy it because I'll have to erase at some point.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:46.580
So, it's for x squared plus 8xy and 3y squared plus 4x squared.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:20:02.580
So, that will become the integral of 4x squared plus 8xy dx plus 3y squared plus 4x squared dy.

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:12.080
Now, to evaluate on this broken line, I will, of course, evaluate separately on each of the two segments.

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:17.760
So, I'll start with this segment that I will call c1, and then I will do this one that I call c2.

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:29.180
So, on c1, how do I evaluate my integral?

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:36.560
Well, if I'm on c1, then x varies from 0 to x1.

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:40.900
Well, actually, I don't know if x1 is positive or not, so I should invite this.

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:45.700
I really should say just x goes from 0 to x1.

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:50.640
And what about y?

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:52.920
Y is just 0.

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:57.600
So, I will set y equals 0 and also dy equals 0.

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:07.060
So, I get that the line integral on c1, well, a lot of stuff goes away.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:12.960
So, the entire second term with dy goes away because dy is 0.

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:17.820
And in the first term, 8xy goes away because y is 0 as well.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:26.080
So, I just have the integral of 4x squared dx from 0 to x1.

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:32.680
So, by the way, now you see why I'm using x1 and y1 for my point, and not just x and y.

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.240
It's to avoid confusion.

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:38.940
I'm using x and y as my integration variables, and x1 and y1 as constants.

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:42.140
But I'm representing the endpoint of my path.

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:49.260
And so, if I integrate this, I should get 4x1 cubed.

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:52.980
So, that's the first part.

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:55.880
And next, I need to do the second segment.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:06.800
So, if I'm on c2, so y goes from 0 to y1.

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:10.140
And what about x?

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.660
Yeah, x is constant equal to x1.

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:17.940
So, dx becomes just 0.

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:18.580
It's a constant.

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:28.120
So, if I take the line integral on c2, oops, here, f of the dR,

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:31.640
then I will get the integral from 0 to y1.

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.340
So, the entire first term with dx goes away.

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:45.740
And then I have 3y squared plus 4, well, x is x1, x1 squared dy.

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:55.700
So, that integrates to y cubed plus 4x1 squared y from 0 to y1.

00:22:56.300 --> 00:23:02.960
Or, if you prefer, that's y1 cubed plus 4x1 squared y1.

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:16.200
Okay, so, now that we have done both of them, we can just add them together.

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.760
And that will give us the formula for the potential.

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:48.740
Okay, so, f of x1 and y1 is 4x1 cubed plus y1 cubed plus y1 squared.

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:52.900
And that's 4x1 squared y1 plus a constant.

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:59.460
Okay, that constant is just the integration constant that we had from the beginning.

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:04.940
Or, you know, now you can drop the subscripts if you prefer.

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:16.620
You can just say, f is 4,3x cubed plus y cubed plus 4x squared y plus constant.

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:25.160
Okay, and you can check if you take the gradient of this, then you could get, again, this vector field over there.

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:29.280
Okay, any questions about this method? Yes.

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:37.880
No, well, it depends whether you're just trying to find one potential or if you're trying to find all the possible potentials.

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:42.720
If a problem just says, find a potential, then you don't have to include the constant, you know.

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:46.060
This guy, we thought the constant is a valid potential.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:48.160
Just you have others.

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:52.300
You know, so if your neighbor comes to you and says, oh, your answer must be wrong.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:56.420
I got this plus 18. Well, you know, both answers are correct.

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:12.080
Okay, by the way, so instead of going first to know the x-axis, then vertically, you could do it the other way around, of course, start to know the y-axis, then horizontally.

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:15.180
And, you know, that's the same level of difficulty.

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:18.120
You just exchange the rules of x and y.

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:27.840
In some cases, it's actually even making more sense, maybe, to go radially straight out from the origin to your endpoint.

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:36.960
But usually, this setting is easier just because each of these two guys was actually very easy to compute.

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:50.320
But somehow, maybe if you suspect that polar coordinates will be involved, somehow in the answer, then maybe it makes sense to choose different paths.

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:52.260
Maybe a straight line is better.

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:56.180
Okay.

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:08.440
So now we have another method to look at, which is using anti-derivatives.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:18.700
Okay. So, I mean, the goal is the same.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:29.140
Still to find the potential function. And you see that finding the potential is really the two, the, you know, multivariable analog of finding the anti-derivative in one variable.

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:35.240
So, you know, here we did it basically by hand by computing the integral.

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:40.060
If you have a thing you could try to say is, wait, I already know how to take anti-derivatives.

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:42.340
Let's use that instead of computing integrals.

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.380
And it works, but you have to be careful about how you do it.

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.040
So, let's see how that works.

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:52.460
Okay. So, let's still do it with the same example.

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:55.720
So, we want to solve the equations.

00:26:56.420 --> 00:27:03.820
We want a function such that f sub x is 4x squared plus 8xy.

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:12.220
And f sub y is 3y squared plus 4x squared.

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:16.460
So, let's just look at one of these at a time.

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:29.480
If we look at this one, well, we know how to solve this because it's just telling us we have to integrate this with respect to x.

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:37.440
Okay. Well, let's call them 1 and 2 because they will have to refer to them again.

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:41.340
So, let's start with equation 1.

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.820
And let's integrate with respect to x.

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:53.920
Well, it tells us that f should be, okay, so what do I get when I integrate this with respect to x?

00:27:54.080 --> 00:28:03.380
I get 4th, 3rd, x cubed plus when I integrate 8xy, y is just a constant.

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:05.860
So, I will get 4x squared y.

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:11.920
And that's not quite the end to it, okay, because there's an integration constant.

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:20.060
And here, when I say there's an integration constant, it just means the extra term does not depend on x.

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:21.940
That's what it means to be a constant in this setting.

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:25.460
But maybe my constant still depends on y.

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:26.920
So, it's not actually a true constant.

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:32.200
A constant that depends on y is not really a constant. It's actually a function of y.

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:39.960
Okay, so the good news that we have is that this function no longer depends on x.

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:41.580
So, it should be, you know, we've made some progress.

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:43.420
We've got part of the answer.

00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:48.500
And, you know, we've simplified the problem.

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:55.640
So, if we have anything that looks like this, it will satisfy the first condition.

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.500
So, now we need to look at the second condition.

00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:01.380
Okay, so we want f sub y to be that.

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:10.400
And, well, so, but we know what f is.

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:12.580
So, let's compute f sub y from this.

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:18.180
Okay, so from this, I get f sub y.

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:21.500
So, what do I get if I differentiate this with respect to y?

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:30.360
Well, I get zero plus four x squared plus the derivative of g.

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:41.420
So, I would like to match this with what I had.

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:54.460
So, if I match this with equation two, then that will tell me what the derivative of g should be.

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:21.140
Okay, so if we compare the two things there, we get four x squared plus g prime of y.

00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:24.940
So, what we do is we get three x squared plus four x squared.

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:29.660
And, of course, the four x squareds go away.

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:34.020
That tells you g prime is three y squared.

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:40.660
And, that integrates to y cubed plus constant.

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:44.280
Now, this time, the constant is a true constant.

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:47.440
Okay, because g did not depend on anything over and over.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.280
So, this is a real constant.

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:59.880
So, now, we just plug this back into this guy, this guy, this guy, star.

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:21.100
If we plug this into star, we get f equals four thirds x cubed plus four x squared y plus y cubed plus constant.

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:24.080
And, of course, again, now, this constant is optional.

00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:34.480
So, you see, the advantage of this method is you don't have to write any integrals.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:38.900
The small drawback is you have to follow this procedure carefully.

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:46.400
So, by the way, one common pitfall, you know, it's tempting.

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:52.780
So, after you've done this, what's very tempting is to just say, oh, well, let's do the same with this guy.

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:54.480
Let's integrate this with respect to y.

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:59.060
You'll get another expression for f up to a constant that depends on x.

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:00.420
And then, let's match them.

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:09.660
Well, the difficulty is matching is actually quite tricky because you don't know in advance whether they will be the same expression.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:20.620
You know, it could be that I got, you know, you could say, oh, let's just take the terms that are here and missing there and combine, you know, the terms that are, you know, take all the terms that appear in either one.

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:29.420
That's actually not a good way to do it because if I put sufficiently complicated trig functions in there, then you might not be able to see that two terms are the same.

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:35.100
You know, to take an easy one, let's say that here I have one plus tangent square and here I have a cotangent square.

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:38.140
I'm sorry, I have a, I mean, second square.

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:43.320
Then, you know, you might not actually notice that there's a difference.

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:47.960
But there's no difference, so I wonder, whatever.

00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:56.060
Okay, so anyway, so I'm saying, you know, do it this way, don't do it any other way because there's a risk of making a mistake of a ways.

00:32:57.020 --> 00:33:03.660
I mean, on the other hand, of course you could start with integrating respect to y and then differentiate and match with the derivative respect to x.

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:16.320
But so what I'm saying is just, you know, take one of them, integrate, get an answer that involves a function of the other variable, then differentiate that answer and compare and see what you get.

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:27.720
By the way, yeah, so here, of course, you know, after we simplified, there were only y's here, there were no x's.

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:35.740
And that's kind of good news. I mean, if you had had an x, an x here in this expression, that would have told you that something is going wrong, right?

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:41.800
G is a function of y only. So if you get an x here, maybe you want to go back and check whether it is really a gradient field.

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:43.560
Yes?

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:50.860
Yes. This will work with functions of more than two variables. So both methods will work with more than two variables.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.980
So we're going to see it in the case where more than two means free. We're going to see that in two or three weeks from now.

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:07.560
I mean, basically, starting at the end of next week, we're going to do triple integrals, line integrals in space and so on.

00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:15.780
The format is first, we do everything in two variables, so then we'll do it in three variables. And what happens with more than three will be left to your imagination.

00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:24.440
Okay, any other questions about either of these methods?

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:33.240
Okay, a quick poll. Who prefers the first method? Who prefers the second method?

00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:49.740
Wow. Okay. So, well, anyway, you get to use whichever one you want. And I would agree with you that the second method is slightly more effective in that you're writing less stuff.

00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:56.440
You don't have to set up all these line integrals for nothing. On the other hand, it does require a little bit more of attention.

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:08.780
Okay. So, well, let's move on a bit.

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:21.280
Well, let me start by actually doing a small gray cap.

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:39.980
So, we say that the vector field is a gradient in a certain region of a plane.

00:35:39.980 --> 00:36:03.000
And we have an aernosthen which is being conservative, which says that the integral, the line integral is zero along any closed curve.

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:20.880
So, actually, let me introduce a new piece of notation. So, to just to remind ourselves that we're doing it along a closed curve, very often we put just a circle through the integral to tell us, well, this is a curve that closes on itself.

00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:22.020
It ends where it started.

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:31.680
I mean, it doesn't change anything concerning the definition or how you compute it or anything. It just reminds you that you're doing it on a closed curve.

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:42.860
It's actually useful for various physical applications. And also, you know, when you state theorems in that way, it reminds you, oh, I need to be on a closed curve to do it.

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:48.160
And so, we've said these two things are equivalent.

00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:57.880
And now, we have a third thing, which is n sub x equals m sub y at every point.

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:07.140
So, just to summarize the discussion, we've said if we have a gradient field, then we have this.

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:13.260
And the converse is true in suitable regions.

00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:26.560
So, we have the converse if f is defined in the entire plane.

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:38.800
Or, as we'll see soon, in a simply connected region.

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:48.880
I guess some of you can't see what I'm writing here, but it doesn't matter because you're not officially supposed to know it yet.

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:50.180
That will be next week.

00:37:53.200 --> 00:38:05.200
Anyway, so I said the fact that n x equals m y implies we have a gradient field is only if a vector field is defined in the entire plane or in a region that's called simply connected.

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:09.900
And more about that later.

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:20.560
So, now let me just introduce a quantity that probably a lot of you have heard about in physics that measures precisely failure to be conservative.

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:26.360
That's called the curl of the vector field.

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:56.240
harp bending i distributionate.

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:20.720
So, the definition, we say that the curl of f is the quantity n sub x minus m sub y.

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:32.060
So, it's just repackaging the information we had, but in a way that's a single quantity.

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:44.300
So, in this new language, the conditions that we had over there, this condition says curl

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:58.140
f equals 0. That's the new version of n x equals m y. So, it measures failure of a vector field

00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:14.140
to be conservative. So, I should probably, so the test for conservativeness is that the curl

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:25.540
of f should be 0. So, I should probably tell you a little bit about what the curl is, what

00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:34.800
it measures what it does, because that's something that's probably useful. It's a very strange quantity,

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:45.440
if you put it in that form. Yes? I think it's the same as the physics one, but I haven't checked the physics textbook recently,

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:51.160
but I believe it's the same. Yes, I think it's the same as the physics one. It's not the opposite of this time.

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:59.340
Of course, in physics, maybe you've seen actually curl in space, and we're going to see curl in space in two or three weeks.

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:07.780
Yes? Yes?

00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:12.920
Well, you can also use it. So, if you fail this test, then you know for sure that you're not a gradient field.

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:19.580
So, you might as well do that. If you satisfy the test, but you're not defined everywhere, then there's still a bit of ambiguity.

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:22.640
And you don't know for sure.

00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:38.360
Okay. Okay. So, let's try to see a little bit what the curl measures.

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:48.700
So, I want to claim that, you know, just to give you some intuition, let's first think about the velocity field.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:06.480
The curl measures the rotation component of a motion.

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:17.060
So, if you want a fancy word, that's measures the vorticity of a motion. It tells you how much twisting is taking place at a given point.

00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:41.180
Okay. So, for example, you know, if I take a constant vector field, you know, where my fluid is just all moving in the same place, in the same direction, you know, where this is just constant, then of course the curl is zero, because if you take the partials, you get zero.

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:49.080
And indeed, that's not what you would call, you know, swirling. I mean, there's no vortex in here.

00:42:54.740 --> 00:43:04.900
On the other hand, well, okay, now let's do another one where there's still nothing going on. Let's say that I take, you know, the radial vector field, where everything just flows away from the origin.

00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:23.160
So, that's f equals x, y. Well, if I take the curl, so I have to take partial, partial x of the second component, which is y, minus partial, partial y of the first component, which is x, I will get zero.

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:52.520
And indeed, you know, if you think about what's going on here, there's no rotation involved. On the other hand, if you consider our favorite rotation vector field, negative y and x, then it's curl.

00:43:53.760 --> 00:44:10.280
It's going to be, well, n sub x minus m sub y will be 1 plus 1 equals 2. And that corresponds to the fact that we are rotating.

00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:22.080
Actually, we're rotating at unit angular speed. So the curl actually measures twice the angular speed of the rotation part of a motion at any given point.

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:41.880
So now, if you have an actual motion, you know, a more complicated field than v's, then no matter where you are, you can think of a motion as a combination of translation effects, maybe dilation effects, maybe rotation effects, possibly, over things like that.

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:48.380
And what the curl will measure is how intense the rotation effect is at that particular point.

00:44:50.500 --> 00:45:02.980
So I'm not going to try to make a much more precise statement. What I mean, the precise statement is, you know, what curl measures is really this quantity of there. But the intuition you would have is it measures how much rotation is taking place at any given point.

00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:15.300
And of course, in a complicated motion, you might have more rotation at some point than at some others, which is why the curl will depend on x and y. It's not just a constant because, you know, how much you rotate depends on where you are.

00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:34.660
So, you know, if you're looking at actual wind velocities in weather prediction, then the regions with high curl tend to be hurricanes or tornadoes or things like that. They're not very pleasant things.

00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:42.600
And the sign of a curl tells you whether you're going clockwise or counterclockwise.

00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:30.380
So, curl measures, well, twice the angular velocity of the rotation component of the velocity field.

00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:47.120
Now, what about the force field? Because after all, you know, where we got to this was coming from and trying to understand forces and the work we do.

00:46:47.120 --> 00:47:16.920
So, it should tell you what it means for a force. Well, the curl of a force field measures the torque exerted on, you know, a test object that you put at any point.

00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:43.080
So, remember torque is the rotational analog of the force. You know, we had this analogy about velocity versus angular velocity and mass versus moment of inertia.

00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:52.200
And then in that analogy, you know, a force divided by the mass is what will cause acceleration, which is the derivative of velocity.

00:47:53.760 --> 00:48:03.820
The torque divided by moment of inertia is what will cause the angular acceleration, namely the derivative of angular velocity. Maybe actually I should write that down.

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:31.460
So, torque divided by moment of inertia is going to be d dt of angular velocity.

00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:51.280
I'll leave it up to your physics teachers to decide what letters to use for all these things. That's the analog of force divided by mass equals acceleration, which is d dt of velocity.

00:48:55.360 --> 00:49:16.200
And so, now you see if the curl of a velocity field measures the angular velocity of its rotation, then, you know, by this analogy, the curl of a force field should measure the torque it exerts on a mass per unit moment of inertia.

00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:34.720
So, concretely, if you imagine that you're putting something in there, you know, if you're in a velocity field, the curl will tell you how fast your guy is spinning at a given time.

00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:41.140
You know, if you put something that floats, for example, on your fluid, you know, something that I light, then it's going to start spinning.

00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:54.340
And the curl of a velocity field tells you how fast it is spinning at a given time, up to a factor of two. And the curl of a force field tells you how quickly the angular velocity is going to increase or decrease.

00:49:56.140 --> 00:50:08.680
Okay, so, well, next time we are going to see green sphere, which is actually going to tell us a lot more about curl and failure of conservativeness.
