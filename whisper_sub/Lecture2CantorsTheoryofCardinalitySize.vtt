00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:20.760
So, last time we spoke about the covered sets and induction, this time I want to ask

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:28.700
a question about sets, which turns out is actually quite a deep question.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.900
I mean, I didn't come up with it myself.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:36.140
This question is at least 150 years old probably.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:49.640
So, the question that I want to ask is, if A and B are sets,

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:09.000
or let's phrase it this way, at least a little more efficiently, when do two sets,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:19.740
A and B have the same size.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.300
Now, this is especially interesting if these two sets are not finite, meaning there's not

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.060
five of them, there's not eight of them.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.880
But there's infinitely many members, whatever that means, and I'll actually define what that means.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.580
For example, do the natural numbers and the integers have the same size, do the natural numbers,

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.140
and the rational numbers have the same size.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.040
What about the rational numbers and the real numbers, even though we haven't defined that yet,

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:03.440
you can still keep in mind your notion of the real numbers from calculus.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.860
And so, this question is, why is it deep?

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:22.660
Because it depends on this word here, size, and what exactly that means.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:29.780
So, I'm not going to...

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.000
So, kind of an answer, this is due to George Cantor.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.820
He said that two sets, so not an answer, but a way of defining size or a way of saying

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.740
the two sets have the same size.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.040
He said, two sets have the same size when...

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:55.700
The...

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:16.020
Of the two sets, the elements of the two sets can be paired off.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:26.260
Meaning, and I will make this much more precise in a minute or so, what does he mean?

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:27.620
What do I mean?

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.540
For example, the set A, B, and C, and the set 1, 2, and 3.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.840
So, this set consists of three letters, A, B, and C.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.660
This set consists of three integers, 1, 2, and 3.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.700
They have the same size because I can essentially pair them off.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:56.320
So, A and 1 go together, B and 2 go together, and C and 3 go together.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.320
Meaning, each one of...

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:09.360
Each member of this set gets paired off with an element of this set, and every element of this set gets paired off with a unique element from this set.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.560
Now, to make...

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.100
And so, this is...

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:32.100
Goes under the name of the theory of cardinality or...

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.900
Cardinal numbers, if you'd like, but we won't go too deeply into it.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.400
So, the way you make...

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:53.140
Or the way one makes this pairing off business more precise is using the language of functions, and you've been dealing with functions since you've been doing calculus.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:05:06.900
So, I'm just going to quickly reintroduce or review some terminology that goes along with functions that, you know, will be the precise...

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.640
Nice meaning of this pairing off business that I'm writing here.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:17.800
But, just with an eye towards the future, this is why I'm reviewing some of these...

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.940
Some of this terminology related to functions.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:28.440
So, a brief review of some terminology for functions.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.360
So, let me just recall that...

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:43.460
If a and b are sets, then...

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:51.800
Function, f, a, b. So, a function is usually written as f, colon, a, arrow to b.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.740
Meaning it takes elements from a into elements from b.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:07.240
This is a mapping that...

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.980
Or, if you like, an assignment...

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.080
It assigns to each x in a...

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.980
A unique element...

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.020
Which we denote f of x in b.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.560
So, one single input x gives me a single output.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.160
An input does not give me three outputs.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:43.040
Now, this is what one would call a naive definition, probably.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.700
Not necessarily completely unambiguous, but for us, this suffices.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:58.660
In the textbook, you can look up a function is unambiguously defined or as a subset of the Cartesian product of a and b,

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.580
which you would recognize as essentially describing the graph of the function.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:09.440
But then you never use that definition of again, and you essentially use this definition

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:14.060
when you think about functions, and when you prove properties of functions.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:21.500
So, this we will just take as our definition, and it will be unambiguous enough for us.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:32.220
So, let f be a function from a to b.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:46.140
If c is a subset of a, we define a set.

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:50.660
So, this is f of capital C. So, c is not an element of a, it's a subset of a.

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:55.620
This is a subset of b. This is...

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.160
Let me write it slightly differently here.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:11.560
This is a set of all y and b, such that there exists an x and c, such that y equals to f of x.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:20.920
And I could write this a little more efficiently as this is the set of all elements, f of x, as x,

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:27.220
ranges over the elements of this subset c.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:43.280
And if d is a subset of b, we define the subset, the set f inverse of d.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:48.040
This is a set of guys that get mapped into d.

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:56.940
So, I should say this is the inverse image of d, not the inverse of this function f.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:04.580
So, the inverse, whatever that means for now, does not necessarily always exist.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.300
So, this inverse image of the set d always exists.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:17.640
This is the set of all elements in a, such that f of x is in d.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:32.700
Okay? So, for example, let me...

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:47.580
So, 1, 2, 3, 4, and a, b, c, d.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:57.520
And let's suppose one goes to a, two goes to a, three goes to c, four goes to d.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:09.520
Okay? Then, f of the set 1, 2, this is where, what is the set that gets...

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.420
So, this is the subset of...

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:19.060
So, this should be, you should think of as b, a, b, and c, and d.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.840
And then, 1, 2, and 3, this is a.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:30.780
So, f of the set of 1, 2, so 1 gets mapped to a, 2 gets mapped to a.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.480
So, this is just the set 2.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:43.040
f of the set, let's go with 1 and 3, 1 gets mapped to a.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.480
So, this should be a.

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:52.440
1 gets mapped to a, and 3 gets mapped to c.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:58.220
Okay? And so, a couple of inverse images.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:07.440
If I look at the inverse image of a, this is equal to the set of all guys that mapped to a.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:11.860
This is, well, 1 maps to a, and 2 maps to a.

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:13.820
So, this is 1, 2.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:22.940
Now, if I look at the inverse image of a, c, d,

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:29.740
what elements get mapped to a, c, and d? Well, 1 and 2 get mapped to a.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.180
3 gets mapped to c, 4 gets mapped to d.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.000
So, everything maps into a, c, and d.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:42.480
So, this is just the original set, or the set a, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:43.720
Okay?

00:11:48.800 --> 00:12:00.080
All right. So, it's more terminology, and this is what we will mean by when two sets can be paired off.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.680
Or this makes that more precise.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.200
Let f be a function from a to b.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:21.240
We say that f is injective, or I'll write 1 to 1,

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:28.680
should be red 1 to 1, if f satisfies the following property.

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:37.920
f of x1 equals f of x2 implies x1 equals x2.

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:44.980
Okay? So, injective or 1 to 1 means if I take two different inputs,

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:46.460
I get two different outputs.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.920
Okay? That's essentially what this means.

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:57.920
I mean taking the equivalent, so equivalently,

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:05.440
from a logical standpoint, this statement,

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.460
implying this statement is equivalent to the negation of this statement,

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.580
implying the negation of this statement.

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:16.160
So, equivalently, this means x not equal to x2 implies f of x1,

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.360
not equal to f of x2.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:25.700
So, maybe this is clear if I were to define f as injective if it satisfies this property.

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:33.160
Maybe that would have been clear that f takes two different elements to two different elements.

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:40.240
But this condition here is typically easier to verify,

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.720
or at least simpler to state, and verify.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:47.480
So, f is surjective,

00:13:54.720 --> 00:14:05.380
or onto if the image of a is b.

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:06.480
Okay?

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:11.800
So, let me write that statement out a little bit more.

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:16.620
Everything in the set b gets mapped to by something from a.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:30.100
So, equivalently, this says that for all y and b,

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:37.500
there exists an x and a, so that f of x equals y.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:39.460
Okay?

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:50.340
f is bijective,

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:56.060
if f is one to one and onto.

00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:01.640
So, it's f is bijective, if it's both injective and surjective.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:15.440
So, for example, this map that we just drew over here that sends one to a, two to b,

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:22.520
I mean two to a, three to c, four to d, this is neither injective nor surjective.

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:29.140
It's not injective because it takes two different elements to the image in b, namely a.

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:30.620
So, it takes one and two to a.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:38.220
It's not surjective because nothing gets mapped to the element b here.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:56.500
So, we've seen that's not surjective.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:03.940
Of course, this map, if I take, again, imagine this is one, two, three, a, b, c, d,

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:11.160
this map here, this function here that takes one to a, two to b, three to c,

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:15.860
this is actually injective but not surjective.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.240
And then, of course, we could change this slightly.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:38.420
And one goes to a, two goes to b, and three goes to b.

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:47.240
Then this is surjective but not injective.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:17:05.700
Now, the map that sends, let's switch sides here, a, b, and c, one, two, three,

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:16.880
a to one, b to two, c to three, this is a bijection, bijective.

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:23.500
So, if I say something's an injection or surjection or bijection, that just means it's a map that is injective,

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:30.500
surjective or bijective respectively.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:49.420
Okay.

00:17:53.840 --> 00:18:16.900
And now, definition, so this is really, there's not much to this definition but just defining a couple of related functions that are related to a given function.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:25.180
If f goes from a to b, g goes from b to c.

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:47.920
The composition, g of f, is the function which goes from a to c, is defined by g of f of x equals g of f of x.

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:56.800
And two, if f is bijective.

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:06.780
So, this is the composition of two functions. I didn't write the word composition but this is g of f means the composition.

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:24.220
Or as referred to as a composition. If f is bijective, then we define the inverse function to f, b to a by the following.

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:48.320
If y is in b, then f inverse of y and a is the unique element in a such that,

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:54.120
if I take this element, stick it into f, I get back y.

00:19:56.460 --> 00:20:02.200
So, inverse, the inverse of a function only exists for bijective functions.

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:06.160
Or at least it's only defined for bijective functions.

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:12.560
Keep that in mind, don't confuse that with the inverse image of sets.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:19.900
Although those two notations look the same, you have an inverse f to the minus one.

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:27.980
F to the minus one, if it's a function, that is the inverse function.

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:35.480
However, if I'm taking f to the minus one of a set, that means the inverse image of that set, as defined over there.

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:49.720
So, bijections, meaning bijective functions, will be what we mean when we say two sets can be paired off.

00:20:51.020 --> 00:21:04.220
It's what we mean when we, or at least what cantors answer to that original question was, when the two sets have the same size.

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:11.580
So, this is the notion of cardinality that I alluded to.

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:32.700
So, two sets, we say two sets, a and b, have the same size.

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:54.600
Cardinality, if there exists a bijection, or a bijective function, f from a to b.

00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.420
Okay.

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:13.760
So, let me just make some notation here.

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:20.320
So, this is not really new objects I'm defining or operations. This is just some notation.

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:24.840
So, when two sets have the same cardinality, we write.

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:46.220
So, this is just a shorthand way of writing that two functions have the same cardinality.

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:50.960
You should not necessarily think this means taking the absolute value of a set.

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:52.840
Okay. That doesn't mean anything.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:57.540
All right. This is just shorthand notation for saying two sets have the same cardinality.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:18.820
If a has the same cardinality as the set one, two, three, up to n, we write a equals n.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:27.640
Okay. That's just shorthand for saying that set has the same cardinality as the natural numbers up to n.

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:51.900
Write a. So, if there exists an injective function, or I will often say either function or map,

00:23:52.720 --> 00:24:03.700
you know, you should take those as synonymous. There exists an injective function, f, if there exists an injective function, f from a to b.

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:15.900
We write this thing. Again, do not read this as taking the absolute value of some set.

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:21.600
And that absolute value is less than or equal to the absolute value of the other set, because that's meaningless.

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:31.040
We haven't said what that means, even. This is just shorthand notation.

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:54.460
And if there exists an injection from a to b, but they don't have the same cardinality,

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:13.580
we write this. Okay. So, even though this notation of these absolute value, things being on the outside of the set,

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:30.160
it makes you think absolute value, or shouldn't be interpreted as absolute value. It's okay to kind of think as, you know, a certain ordering being there as one, as sort of a having smaller size than b.

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:42.800
Okay. We write this because there being an injection from one set to the other, kind of means I can pair off elements of a with some elements of b.

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:50.400
Okay. Maybe I don't get all of the elements of b, but I can pair off some of the elements of a with some of the elements of b.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:57.080
For example, that first map we wrote up there. Yeah. That says that to set one, two, three.

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:07.620
In size is less than or equal to the size of a, b, c, d, because we found an injection, an injective map from the first set to the second set.

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:20.980
This third map would say that the size of the set a, b, c is equal to three written here, or shorthand written here.

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:36.380
Okay. And in fact, that first map that we wrote up there again is, so from first map, this says that the set of one, two, three.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:45.060
In our shorthand notation, absolute value, as is less than the size of a, b, c, d. Okay.

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:52.700
So don't think of these as saying the absolute value, it's best to maybe think of this as saying the size of. Okay.

00:26:52.700 --> 00:27:05.580
Alright. So if there exists an injective map from, or function from one set to another, then the size of a is less than or equal to the size of b.

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:14.840
If the size of a is less than or equal to size of b, but the size of a and b are not the same, we write the size of a is less than the size of b. Okay.

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:27.680
So best to think of those, this absolute value looking thing as being shorthand for saying the words size of. Okay.

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:53.440
Now I'm not going to prove this, it goes a little bit beyond the scope of this class, but let me just say that this ordering, this inequality, these symbols that we're writing, does bear some sort of semblance to the ordering of real numbers.

00:27:53.440 --> 00:28:04.000
If I have two real numbers, one is less than or equal to the other, and vice versa, so a is less than or equal to b, and b is less than or equal to a, then a must equal b.

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:09.480
That is in fact true also for this elementary notion of size of sets.

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:21.580
And this is, I mean, you should, it shouldn't surprise you for, you know, finite sets, necessarily.

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:35.960
If I have a pairing of a, if a is no bigger than, n, and n is no bigger than the size of a, then a should have n elements.

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:58.200
But it takes a little bit more to prove for sets which are not finite, so I forgot to write this down. We also say that a, if the size of a is equal to the size of this finite set one through n, we say a is finite.

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:28.180
So this theorem that I'm stating here is the Cantor-Schroeder Bernstein theorem, which states that if the size of a is less than or equal to the size of b, and the size of a is finite, then a should have n elements.

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:38.620
So if the size of b is less than or equal to the size of a, then size of a equals the size of b.

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:52.500
So again, if you're thinking of these in the context of real numbers, one being less than or equal to the other, and vice versa, of course that implies that those two real numbers are equal to each other.

00:29:52.500 --> 00:30:12.180
But we're not talking about real numbers. Again, this is just short-hand notation for saying there exists a bijective map from a to b. This means there exists a bijective map from a to the set. This means there exists an injective map from a to this set.

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:19.360
So this is not a statement about real numbers. This is a statement about cardinality.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:39.680
So finite sets are sets that you can count if you had n fingers.

00:30:40.660 --> 00:31:08.000
Now, you know, we would like to be able to define what it means to be able to count a set. So what I mean by count a set, meaning if I had infinite time, I could go through the set, counting them 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and so on.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:25.640
I don't need to go anymore. But what does that process of counting mean? That means for each element of the set that I'm trying to count, I can pair it off with a natural number, 1, 2, 3, and so on.

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:55.080
So this is how we define countable sets. If a has the same size as the natural numbers, meaning there exists a bijection from a to the natural numbers, then we say a is countably infinite.

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:23.400
If a is finite, or countably, I also use a lot of shorthand, so it's not clever shorthand, so you should just be able to sound what, like if you just sound that out, you'll get what word I mean, countably infinite.

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:53.380
We say a is countable. So countably infinite means I need all the natural numbers to be able to count off the elements of the set, a, countable means maybe I stop after some point, and I've counted all them, so a is finite, or it's countably infinite.

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:58.520
Otherwise, if a set is not countable, we say it's uncountable.

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:28.500
So let's take a look at a couple of countable sets that maybe I'm going to have to count all the natural numbers.

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:32.160
So I don't come off as being countable.

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:51.940
So a set of, actually that's a homework problem. The set of even integers is countable.

00:33:54.560 --> 00:34:09.340
The set of odd, so I said integers a minute ago, maybe I should just say natural numbers, the set of odd natural numbers is countable.

00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:16.880
So in fact, so this is just a side.

00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:31.260
So these are two disjoint subsets that make up the natural numbers, even in odd natural numbers.

00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:45.680
And they both have the same size as the set that they make up. So it's almost like saying the cardinality of the natural numbers is twice the cardinality of the natural numbers.

00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:54.440
So you would think that the size of n should be the size of this set plus the size of this set since they're disjoint and they make up the set.

00:34:57.060 --> 00:35:06.160
But that's not how a cardinality works. You don't just add cardinalities to get the cardinalities.

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:20.160
So this is kind of a subtle, interesting thing about cardinalities and so Richard Feynman, who won the Nobel Prize in the 60s,

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:44.180
for his work on QED, described this as saying there are twice as many numbers as numbers.

00:35:48.500 --> 00:36:06.140
Okay, so let's prove this. So what does this mean? This means we have to be able to find a bijective function from this set to this set.

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:25.060
Okay, or from this set to this set, one or the other. And so in fact, maybe I should, well I'll say something about that in a minute.

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:40.120
Well, let me pause this just for a minute. And let me make a few comments called cardinality, which maybe I should have.

00:36:47.860 --> 00:37:02.120
So, let's see if you can think of as a little theorem. If I have two sets, A has the same size as B, then B has the same size as A.

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:16.980
So remember, what I just said in English is not exactly what those symbols mean. Remember, this means there exists a bijection from A to B. This means there exists a bijection from B to A.

00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:44.280
So what is the proof of this statement? So let's start off with the hypothesis. Suppose there exists bijective map, bijection, bijective function,

00:37:45.860 --> 00:38:04.300
F from A to B. Now if I have a bijection from A to B, then what would be a bijection going from B to A? That would just be the inverse.

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:15.460
So this is not the inverse image of sets like we describe it the actual inverse which we defined over there.

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:39.520
So B has the same size as A.

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:44.700
Okay.

00:38:44.700 --> 00:39:01.700
Okay.

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:22.620
So, if A and B have the same size and B and C have the same size. So again, A, B and C are sets. I should have written that at the beginning, but from this context you should understand that A, B and C are sets.

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:27.900
So, if A and C have the same size.

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:47.600
Okay. So let's do a proof of that. So, let's start with the hypothesis meaning A has the same size as B and B has the same size as C.

00:39:56.300 --> 00:40:06.240
So, what do these two statements mean in terms of the definition? That means there exists bijection from A to B and a bijection from B to C.

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:16.240
Okay.

00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:48.750
So, perhaps I should have said a few more words about why this is true. So, but I'm going to leave this as the exercise just to kind of pause the lecture and do it yourself.

00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:59.710
And what I'll write shortly for this case, I'll actually prove that the thing I'm going to define is a bijection that should help you.

00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:26.330
So, let me draw over here off to the side. We have, you know, again, 1, 2, 3, A, B, C. So, think of this as F. This is my set A. This is my set B. And then I have alpha, beta, gamma.

00:41:26.330 --> 00:41:41.590
And A gets mapped to alpha, B gets mapped to beta, C gets mapped to gamma. So, what would be the map going from A down to the set C? Well, perhaps the composition.

00:41:41.590 --> 00:42:00.550
1 gets mapped to A, which gets mapped to alpha. So, 1 gets mapped to alpha. 2 gets mapped to beta. 3 gets mapped to gamma. How do I build this function out of the things that I know, namely this F in G? Well, this function going from A to C is just a composition of these two functions.

00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:26.750
So, this is often the side. This is not a part of the proof. Let H go from A to C, D the function, G of F of X.

00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:50.450
So, I claim that this function is a bijection. So, we want to prove that it's 1 to 1 and on 2.

00:42:51.790 --> 00:43:09.230
So, let's do 1 to 1 first. Suppose this is the part where I'm going to put this in parentheses, meaning what we're doing now. So, we're going to prove that H is 1 to 1.

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:25.170
So, that means we have to verify the definition that I've erased. So, remember the definition. So, let's write it all out.

00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:55.150
We first show H is 1 to 1. And what this means, according to the definition that I'm now writing over, if H of X1 equals H of X2, then X1 equals X2.

00:43:56.930 --> 00:44:25.130
So, this is what we want to prove. This is the definition of H being 1 to 1. So, let's start. If H of X1 equals H of X2, then in terms of how we've defined H, which is G of F of X, so the composition, then this means G of F of X1.

00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:45.790
This means G of F of X2. That's just what H is. Now, this statement here, now G we know is a bijection. We know G is 1 to 1.

00:44:45.790 --> 00:45:04.570
And since G of something equals G of something else, and G is 1 to 1, this implies that F of X1 equals F of X2. This is since G is 1 to 1.

00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:19.010
So, starting with this, in the definition of H being the composition, we conclude that F of X1 has to equal F of X2 because G is 1 to 1.

00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:36.190
Now, since F is also 1 to 1, we are assuming that F and G are bijections. Since F is 1 to 1, this implies X1 equals X2, since F is 1 to 1.

00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:50.730
And this is what we wanted to prove. We wanted to start with assuming H of X1 equals H of X2 and prove X1 equals X2, which is what we've done.

00:45:50.730 --> 00:46:00.930
So thus, we've proven that H is 1 to 1. Now, we have to show that it's surjective, that it's on to.

00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:30.910
H of A equals C. And again, I'll write out what this means. This means for all Y and C, or let me call it Z, there exists an X and A such that H of X1 equals C.

00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:51.790
Now, we use the fact that F and G were injective to conclude that the composition is injective. So, it stands to the reason that we're going to use the fact that they're both surjective to prove that H is surjective.

00:46:54.710 --> 00:47:11.790
So, we need to prove that for all Z and C, there exists an X and A such that H of X equals Z. So, let Z be in C. Now, we need to find some X and A that gets mapped to Z. We'll use that G and F are both surjective.

00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:32.510
So, and what's the picture that kind of goes along with this? Here's the set C, B and A. We have some element of Z.

00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:54.310
And we know that since G is surjective, there's some element in B that gets mapped to Z by G. But now since F going from A to B is surjective, there exists some X which maps to Y.

00:47:56.610 --> 00:48:08.650
And then that's the whole argument. That's it. I drew this picture, but now I just need to turn it into English using the properties and assumptions that I have.

00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:25.950
Since G is surjective, there exists a Y and B such that G of Y equals Z.

00:48:37.070 --> 00:48:51.450
Since F is surjective, there exists an X and A so that F of X equals Y.

00:48:54.390 --> 00:49:15.190
But then, if I look at H of X, this is equal to G of F of X which is equal to G of Y which is equal to Z by how we've defined Y, remember G of Y equals Z, how we found Y, and how we found X, remember F of X equals this Y.

00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:42.410
And therefore, this map H is on to and therefore H is a bijection proving this theorem. So that should help you in your many exercise to prove that the inverse of a bijection is a bijection.

00:49:52.090 --> 00:49:55.550
So back to what we're doing to begin with.

00:49:57.070 --> 00:50:08.550
We want to show the set of even natural numbers has the same size as the natural numbers, has the same cardinality as the natural numbers and the same for the odd ones.

00:50:08.550 --> 00:50:22.590
So I'm just going to do the odd ones. Again, this will be a small exercise for you to prove number two the statement for the odd ones. So I'm going to do the even one and you can do the odd ones.

00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:49.550
You should, if you plan on studying more math, get used to the instructor, professor, research paper writer, textbook author, giving out little exercises to make sure that you're following along and that you can do some minor task at some point during the discussion.

00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:54.610
Okay, so we're going to find.

00:50:56.250 --> 00:51:19.690
And so we want to show that the natural numbers has the same size as the even natural numbers, which is the same as this statement by that first theorem I wrote up there.

00:51:21.970 --> 00:51:37.470
Now, that means we need to find a bijection from the natural numbers to the set of even natural numbers. This should be not too bad.

00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:44.550
So again, this is off to the side. This is not part of the proof.

00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:13.110
So, what would be the map going from these guys to these guys? Well, I mean, there's several you could choose, but maybe the simplest is one gets mapped to two.

00:52:13.110 --> 00:52:21.510
Two gets mapped to four, three gets mapped to six, four gets mapped to eight, five to ten, six to twelve, and so on and so on.

00:52:22.310 --> 00:52:29.570
Okay, now what is that map? And now I'll re, I'll continue the proof.

00:52:34.210 --> 00:52:54.270
Let F be the function into the even natural numbers defined by F of N equals two times N.

00:52:54.270 --> 00:53:06.810
And so we're in a natural number. Okay, so this is just formally writing the function that takes one to two, two to four, three to six, four to eight, and so on and so on.

00:53:06.810 --> 00:53:16.270
So, I claim F is bijection, so I have to show that F is one to one and onto.

00:53:22.650 --> 00:53:38.730
So, we first show F is one to one. So that means that I have to assume F of N1 equals F of N2 and conclude that N1 equals N2.

00:53:38.730 --> 00:53:55.790
So, let me actually write out what this means again for you to say that F is one to one, is one to one IE, if F of N1 equals F of N2, then N1 equals N2.

00:53:55.790 --> 00:54:08.970
But this is easy to verify for this function that we've written down because if F of N1 equals F of N2, so remember this is what we want to show.

00:54:08.970 --> 00:54:17.590
So, to show it, I start with my assumption and I need to conclude N1 equals N2.

00:54:21.110 --> 00:54:28.430
So, suppose F of N1 equals F of N2, my assumption, my hypothesis, I need to conclude N1 equals N2.

00:54:30.370 --> 00:54:43.270
Then this implies by the definition of F, two times N1 equals two times N2, which by algebra of just eliminating the two, N1 equals N2, which is the conclusion that I want.

00:54:44.430 --> 00:54:52.030
So, I've proven the statement that if F of N1 equals F of N2, then N1 equals N2. Therefore, F is one to one.

00:54:56.130 --> 00:55:09.870
So, thus, F is one to one. So, now we want to show F is onto surjective.

00:55:10.970 --> 00:55:33.630
Now, write this out again, IE, for all elements that are N that are an even number, there is an N such that F of N equals M.

00:55:43.390 --> 00:55:51.390
Now, let M be an even integer. And so, not to confuse this, let me write two times K.

00:55:52.190 --> 00:55:59.610
This is the same set, just using a different dummy variable instead of N in my description of the even natural numbers.

00:56:05.010 --> 00:56:07.110
Then, and let's do that here as well.

00:56:15.130 --> 00:56:22.190
Again, this is not changing anything, this is just changing the letter I'm using to describe this set, which is inconsequential.

00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:30.830
But I don't want you to get the false impression that somehow I'm not doing anything at all.

00:56:34.130 --> 00:56:50.570
Okay, so suppose I have an even integer, then there exists simply by the definition of this set, there exists an N, natural number, so that M equals two times N.

00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:59.010
Then, F of this natural number, which is two times N equals M.

00:56:59.370 --> 00:57:02.870
And therefore, I get something that maps to M.

00:57:12.170 --> 00:57:19.550
Therefore, F is on to, therefore, F is a bijection, and the two sets have the same cardinality.

00:57:20.550 --> 00:57:21.030
Okay?

00:57:23.250 --> 00:57:29.470
All right.

00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:43.630
So, let's where we at, where should I write?

00:57:44.170 --> 00:57:45.030
That's right here.

00:57:50.970 --> 00:57:53.770
Maybe I'll leave that up, because I don't want to...

00:58:10.530 --> 00:58:21.390
Now, using this, and I'll probably put this in the homework, I mean, one can also show.

00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:36.350
So, I should say using this, but one can also show that the integers have the same size as the natural numbers.

00:58:39.390 --> 00:58:44.750
Which again is a little bit surprising, since the natural numbers are a strict subset of Z.

00:58:48.330 --> 00:58:49.370
So, what's the proof?

00:58:50.450 --> 00:59:03.730
So, I'm going to draw a picture, then I'm going to write down the function, and then I'm going to leave it as, actually, I'm going to put it in the homework that, for you to verify that this function is one to one and onto.

00:59:03.730 --> 00:59:10.270
So, let's say...

00:59:19.310 --> 00:59:23.810
There's as many natural numbers as I want to write.

00:59:35.790 --> 00:59:38.250
And as many integers as I want to write.

00:59:39.870 --> 00:59:52.350
Okay? So, what would be a way of mapping the integers in a one to one and onto fashion onto the natural numbers?

00:59:56.050 --> 01:00:03.490
Well, what we could do, first off, let's send zero to one, just to get zero out of the way.

01:00:05.610 --> 01:00:15.070
And from then on, now we just need to find a way to map the positive integers and the negative integers onto the natural numbers bigger than two.

01:00:16.610 --> 01:00:29.510
And in some way, mentally, we should feel like we can do this, because we kind of did it over there, but not explicitly.

01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:42.610
So, how about we take one to two, two to four, three to six, four would then go to eight.

01:00:44.290 --> 01:00:54.930
And we'll take one to three minus two to five, again, crossed.

01:00:56.450 --> 01:01:01.550
And then minus three would get sent to seven.

01:01:01.550 --> 01:01:16.470
So, you see that the positive integers get mapped to the even natural numbers, and the negative integers get mapped to the odd natural numbers bigger than one.

01:01:19.530 --> 01:01:25.910
Okay? So, I'm not even going to write the proof. This will be part of the homework.

01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:46.350
Now, you know, it is a bit surprising that there are twice as many numbers as numbers, not too surprising since, you know, kind of these subsets, if you picture them as I've been doing as subsets of the real line, you know, they're kind of discrete.

01:01:46.350 --> 01:02:03.470
So, you should be able to count them. What is more surprising is whether or not you can count subsets that, in some sense, are not discrete, for example, what about the rational numbers?

01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:27.870
So, this is a theorem that, and let me just look at those positive rational numbers. In fact, I could take all rational numbers, but for the statement of this theorem, if I look at those rational numbers with which are positive,

01:02:31.710 --> 01:02:55.830
then this has the same size as the natural numbers. You can count the positive rational numbers, which is just, you know, a bit crazy to me, because, you know, here, at least for, let's say, the integers, once I'm at an integer, I can move to a next biggest one and count that one in some way.

01:02:55.830 --> 01:03:11.090
Right? And so, that kind of makes it believable that I can count the integers. The integers have the same size as the natural numbers, even though at first glance, it looks like there's twice as many.

01:03:13.130 --> 01:03:24.530
But for rational numbers, you know, between any two rational numbers, there's another rational number in between them. Right? You just take the average of those two rational numbers.

01:03:25.590 --> 01:03:40.290
So, it's not, so now this idea of being at a rational number and then sort of moving to the next big one, that you can't do that now. So, now it's, it's a little bit up in the air at least, whether or not you can count the rational numbers.

01:03:41.550 --> 01:03:50.430
And what I'm saying is that, indeed, you can, and this will be part of the homework. I will at least,

01:03:54.550 --> 01:04:01.630
give you an idea of how the proof will go. What, we will actually be able to write down a map based on a simple fact.

01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:10.090
So, let me not write down proof, but let me write down, remark.

01:04:12.190 --> 01:04:24.210
So, we'll actually, actually be able to write down a map based on one simple fact, which is this fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which says that, so this is just discussion now.

01:04:24.530 --> 01:04:38.930
You know, more stuff will be written in the homework about this, but so just try to follow along. So, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic says that, if you have a positive natural number, you can write it in a unique way as a product of prime numbers.

01:04:39.850 --> 01:05:07.350
Now, for rational numbers, using that, that means you can write every rational number uniquely as a product of prime numbers divided by another product of prime numbers, where no two prime numbers, where the prime numbers up top and the prime numbers at the bottom, none are in common, meaning you've simplified as much as possible.

01:05:07.350 --> 01:05:18.150
So, instead of, you know, 15 over 3, it's not good, let's say, 15 over 30, you have 1 half, okay.

01:05:19.310 --> 01:05:45.810
So, the map that I would take, so what I'm saying here is that every rational number can be written as some product.

01:05:45.810 --> 01:06:14.910
So, let me not use that notation, but some product P, R1, Pn, Rn, Q1, S1, Qm, SN, where P1, P2, and Pn, these are all primes, Q1, up to Qm, they're all primes, R1, Rn, these are all exponents, positive natural numbers.

01:06:14.910 --> 01:06:35.650
So, Rj, Sk, these are natural numbers, P1, Pn, Q1, Qm, or primes, and for all jk, Qj does not equal pk.

01:06:35.650 --> 01:06:42.610
So, there's no prime that appears both up here and down here, we've already simplified that away, okay.

01:06:44.470 --> 01:07:04.870
So, then the map, so this, so just so, you know, I don't think I'm fooling you, you know, 9 halves, which is a positive rational number,

01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:14.670
this is 3 squared over 2, yeah. You know, 20, I'm not going to do anymore, that's it.

01:07:16.130 --> 01:07:33.170
You should. So, the map that we will take from this rational number to a natural number will be this gets mapped to the natural number,

01:07:33.170 --> 01:07:53.530
P1, 2R1, Pn, 2Rn, times now Q1 to 2S1 minus 1, Qm to SN minus 1.

01:07:53.530 --> 01:08:07.450
So, basically, I map it to the integer that has this expansion in terms of prime numbers, where now the exponents of these prime numbers is even depending on these exponents on top,

01:08:07.710 --> 01:08:14.710
and the exponents of this one are odd, depending on this exponent on top, okay.

01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:26.750
So, for example, 3 squared over 2, this would get mapped to 3 to the 4 times 2.

01:08:36.090 --> 01:08:41.150
Okay. So, what we'll do in the homework is show that this map is in fact a bijection.

01:08:41.150 --> 01:09:06.670
So, okay. So, those two terms, you will prove in the homework that won't be too bad, I will leave enough hints.

01:09:06.670 --> 01:09:13.250
So, dealt with Z, dealt with Q essentially.

01:09:25.770 --> 01:09:39.470
I mean, so, let me actually write down, this is really a corollary of these two theorems here, which I haven't proved, but you will prove in the homework.

01:09:39.470 --> 01:09:55.090
So, this says that the rationals are countable, all the rationals, not just the positive ones, and what's the proof?

01:10:00.370 --> 01:10:15.710
So, we know that, so, I'm going to give you kind of a sketch, should I sketch it or should I write it all out?

01:10:15.710 --> 01:10:27.990
I'm running a little bit out of time, but, so, maybe I will just tell you why this is true.

01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:34.390
I mean, all the details are essentially here, I'm just not going to write it as carefully as I've been writing down the proofs before.

01:10:34.390 --> 01:10:51.310
So, let me write this as the proof sketch. Of course, you can write these, you can actually use the definitions and write this out, but this is the essential idea.

01:10:51.310 --> 01:11:03.270
So, we have that the size of rational numbers.

01:11:05.010 --> 01:11:26.850
So, let me, this has the same size as the rational numbers, which are negative.

01:11:36.270 --> 01:11:45.710
And this, how do we establish this, or, instead of using the same letter, let's say, R,

01:11:51.170 --> 01:12:06.650
since f of q equals minus q is a bijection from the first set to the second set.

01:12:06.650 --> 01:12:32.910
So, if I just take a rational number, positive one, take its minus, then I get an element of the second set, and this is a bijection.

01:12:32.910 --> 01:13:01.170
Okay, so, thus, since this has the same size as the natural numbers, and by that theorem we proved over there, the size of this set is the same as the natural numbers, so it is countable.

01:13:01.170 --> 01:13:28.310
Okay, then there exists bijections, f going from q, so the positive rational numbers to the natural numbers.

01:13:30.850 --> 01:13:49.130
And g going from the negative ones to the natural numbers.

01:13:50.830 --> 01:14:01.070
Okay, so, picture here is, well, let's not write, draw the picture yet.

01:14:02.730 --> 01:14:07.230
Okay, so I have these two bijections from the positive rationales to the integers.

01:14:07.230 --> 01:14:13.670
So, here's this one from the negative rationales to the natural numbers.

01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:21.850
How do I get a map that goes from all of q now to the natural numbers? Well, let's go in between and go to the integers.

01:14:21.850 --> 01:14:51.810
Then I define a function h, which goes now from all of q to the integers by h of x equals 0, if x equals 0, equals f of x.

01:14:51.810 --> 01:15:10.390
If x is positive, and negative, g of x, if x is negative. Okay, and h is a bijection.

01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:23.330
So, everything up into this point has been completely fine with the exception of me verifying that this map is a bijection, and this map is a bijection.

01:15:23.430 --> 01:15:28.770
So, that's kind of the only parts that I'm leaving out for you to verify. Then h is a bijection.

01:15:28.770 --> 01:15:41.530
So, q has the same cardinality as integers, which we've shown has the same cardinality as the natural numbers.

01:15:43.470 --> 01:15:51.210
And therefore, the rationals have the same cardinality as the natural numbers, so they are countably infinite.

01:16:02.810 --> 01:16:16.210
So, a natural question is, I mean, is there anything bigger than the natural numbers? Because everything I've written down, it has the size of the natural numbers.

01:16:18.990 --> 01:16:30.550
We haven't really defined the real numbers well enough yet to make any sort of claim like that about the real numbers.

01:16:32.230 --> 01:16:53.850
And now is there just any set that is bigger in size than the natural numbers? The answer to that was unknown, and it's pretty strikingly yes, in fact.

01:17:00.870 --> 01:17:04.750
So, let me phrase that question.

01:17:12.970 --> 01:17:27.750
Does there exist a set such that a has strictly bigger cardinality than the natural numbers.

01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:41.130
So, a is uncountable. So, to answer this question astoundably yes, let me first define for a general object.

01:17:45.090 --> 01:17:56.730
If a is a set, we define script p of a, this is the power set of a.

01:18:05.590 --> 01:18:09.710
This is a set that consists of all subsets of a.

01:18:10.570 --> 01:18:17.270
So, this is a set of all sets b, such that b is a subset of a.

01:18:20.170 --> 01:18:43.690
So, for example, if a is the empty set, the power set, so a is empty, what are the subsets of the empty set? Well, there's only one subset of the empty set, the empty set.

01:18:45.070 --> 01:18:49.570
So, even though the empty set has no members, its power set has one member.

01:18:53.270 --> 01:19:03.910
If a equals one, then the power set of a, the set of all subsets, consists of the empty set, and the set itself, one.

01:19:06.670 --> 01:19:31.390
Let's do one more. If a is the set one, two, then the power set of a, this is the set, which consists of the empty set, because this is a subset of the set, the set consisting of one, because this is a subset of the set, or two.

01:19:36.570 --> 01:19:49.950
Now, notice something, this set had cardinality, strictly speaking, I should have defined that as having cardinality zero, yet its power set has cardinality one.

01:19:50.730 --> 01:20:05.690
A has size one, because it's, in one to one correspondence, with just one, and its power set has two elements, so it has cardinality two, I could count them off, one, two.

01:20:06.950 --> 01:20:16.110
A has size two, has two elements, and the power set of a has size four, it has four different elements, the empty set one, two, one, two.

01:20:16.110 --> 01:20:45.530
So, what one can prove in general, and which will appear on the homework, is if a has the same card has size n, so it's a finite set of size n, meaning it's in one to one correspondence with the numbers one up to n, then its power set is also finite.

01:20:47.810 --> 01:20:57.350
And has cardinality two to the n, and you can prove by induction if you like that two to the n is always bigger than n.

01:21:03.410 --> 01:21:18.270
And so a theorem I'll prove next time, which will finish our discussion of sets and cardinality, and then we'll move on to the real numbers, is this theorem due to cantor,

01:21:24.430 --> 01:21:36.030
which says that not just for finite sets do we have the power set being in some sense strictly bigger than the original set, but for any set.

01:21:36.030 --> 01:21:53.110
So, the theorem due to cantor is if a is a set, then the cardinality of a is strictly smaller than the cardinality of its power set.

01:21:53.970 --> 01:22:02.230
So, this definitely answers our question, does there exist a set with cardinality bigger than the natural numbers.

01:22:03.110 --> 01:22:22.670
So, let me write this as a remark. In fact, maybe I'll state this as another theorem, which just follows immediately from this kind of getting used over and over again, is that the cardinality of the natural numbers.

01:22:22.670 --> 01:22:35.950
This is less than the cardinality of the power set of the natural numbers, which is less than the cardinality of the power set of the natural numbers.

01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:53.750
I can now take this as a set and take its power set, and I get a new set with bigger size, which is less than the power set of the power set, where how many do we have now, of the power set of natural numbers, and so on.

01:22:54.750 --> 01:23:10.750
Okay? So, informally this means there...

01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:34.640
There's an infinity of infinitudes. There's an infinite number of infinite sizes. One getting strictly in some sense, strictly bigger than the previous size.

01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:53.300
Okay? And maybe you're wondering... There's one more question that's kind of sandwiched in between here, pun intended, is...

01:23:54.300 --> 01:23:56.840
Let's look at this first guy.

01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:26.100
Does there exist set A such that it has size bigger than natural numbers, so it's uncountable, but has size strictly smaller than the power set of the natural numbers.

01:24:27.220 --> 01:24:34.060
And this question is called the continuum hypothesis.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:47.020
Hypothesis because it is independent from one of the standard axiomatic treatments of set theory.

01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:57.540
But we will not touch this question. This is beyond the scope of this class, but it's an interesting question that's out there that people just don't know.
