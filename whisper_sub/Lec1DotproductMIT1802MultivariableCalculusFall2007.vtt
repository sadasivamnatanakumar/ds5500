00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.180
So let's start right away with stuff

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.800
that we will need to see before we can go on to more advanced

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.120
things.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.980
So hopefully, you start in recitation,

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.480
you heard a bit about vectors.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.780
How many of you actually knew about vectors before that?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.080
OK, that's the vast majority.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.360
If you're not one of those people,

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.280
well, hopefully you will learn about vectors right now.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.100
I'm sorry that the learning curve will be a bit steeper

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.160
for the first week, but hopefully you will just find.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.160
If you have trouble with vectors,

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.340
do go to your recitation instructors

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.180
of this house for extra practice if you feel the need to.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.900
You'll see it's pretty easy.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:14.560
So just to remind you, a vector is a quantity that

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.300
has both a direction and a magnitude or length.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.260
So completely, the way you draw a vector

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.440
is by some a hole like that.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.960
And so it has a length, and it's pointing in some direction.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.820
And so now, the way that we compute things with vectors,

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.860
typically, is we introduce a coordinate system.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.980
So if we're in the plane x, y, x is, if we're in space, x, y, z,

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.200
x is, so usually I will try to draw my x, y, z, x is

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.980
consistently to look like this.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.740
And then I can represent my vector in terms of its components

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.640
along the coordinate axis.

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:12.400
So that means when I have this row,

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.400
I can ask how much does it go in the x direction?

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.940
How much does it go in the y direction?

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.880
How much does it go in the z direction?

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.720
And so, for example, let's call this a vector, a.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.380
So a small convention.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.820
When we have a vector quantity, we put an arrow on top

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.140
to remind us that it's a vector.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.900
If it's in a textbook, then sometimes it's

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.060
in bold because it's easier to type set.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.420
If you've tried in your favorite word processor,

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.540
that's bold is easy, and vectors are not easy.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:52.960
So the vector, you can try to decompose in terms of unit

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.040
vectors directed along the coordinate axis.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.160
So the convention is there's a vector that we call i hat,

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.600
that points along the x axis and has length 1.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.260
There's a vector called j hat that does the same along the y

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.920
axis and the k hat that does the same along the z axis.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.200
And so we can express any vector in terms of its components.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:29.360
So the other notation is a1, a2, a3 between these square

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.680
brackets.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.560
Well, maybe it should say angular brackets.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:44.400
So the length of a vector, we denote by, if you want it,

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.280
it's the same notation as the absolute value.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:47.800
So that's going to be a number.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.300
As we say now, a scalar quantity.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.640
So a scalar quantity is a usual numerical quantity,

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.200
as opposed to a vector quantity.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:07.880
And its direction is sometimes called the r of a.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.800
And that can be obtained just by scaling the vector down

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.520
to unit length, for example, by dividing it by its length.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.300
So well, there's a lot of notation to be learned.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.300
So for example, if I have 2 points p and q,

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.120
then I can draw a vector from p to q.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.820
And that vector is called vector pq.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:41.320
OK?

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.040
So maybe we call it a.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.780
But a vector doesn't really have necessarily a starting

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:49.880
point and an ending point.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.680
So if I decide to start here, and I go by the same distance

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.020
in the same direction, this is also a vector a.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.060
It's the same vector.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.220
So a lot of vectors will draw starting at the origin,

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.340
but we don't have to.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:06.320
OK?

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:13.040
So let's just check and see how things went in recitation.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.340
So let's say that I give you the vector free to 1.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.460
And so what do you think about the length of this vector?

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.920
OK?

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.340
I see an answer forming.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.020
So a lot of you are answering the same thing.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.980
Maybe I shouldn't spoil it for those who haven't made it yet.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.720
OK, I think the overwhelming vote is in favor of answer number two.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.360
I see some sixes.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:01.860
I don't know.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.300
That's a perfectly good answer, too.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.620
But hopefully, in a few minutes, I don't know anymore.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:10.720
So let's see.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:22.040
How do we find the length of a vector free to 1?

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:30.900
Well, so this vector a, it comes towards us along the x-axis

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.580
by three units.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.800
It goes to the right along the y-axis by two units.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.500
And then it goes up by one unit along the z-axis.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.300
OK?

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.620
So it's pointing towards here.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.060
That's pretty hard to draw.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.040
So how do we get this length?

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.540
Well, maybe we can start with something easier,

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.900
the length of a vector and the plane.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:03.840
So observe that a is obtained from a vector b in the plane.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.940
Let's say b equals 3i at plus 2j hat.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.200
And then we just have to still go up by one unit.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:14.160


00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.040
So let me try to draw a picture in this vertical plane

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.340
that contains a and b.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.700
If I draw it in the vertical plane, so that's the z-axis.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.600
That's not any particular axis.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:31.560
Then my vector b will go here.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.500
And my vector a will go above it.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.340
And here that's one unit.

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:44.980
And here I have a right angle.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:51.900
So I can use the Pythagorean theorem to find that length a squared

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:55.280
equals length b squared plus 1.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.400
Now we are reduced to finding the length of b.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.220
But the length of b we can again find using the Pythagorean theorem

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:06.680
in the xy plane because here we have the right angle.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.400
Here we have three units and here we have two units.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:11.280
OK?

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:15.500
So if you do the calculations, you will see that well,

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.020
length of b is squared out of 3 squared plus 2 squared

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.140
that's 13. So square root of 13.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:36.020
And length of a is square root of length b squared plus 1 squared,

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:42.500
if you want, which is going to be square root of 13 plus 1 is

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.220
square root of 14.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:49.040
Hence, answer number two, which almost all of you gave.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.400
OK, so the general formula, if you follow what we did,

00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:05.920
in general, if we have a vector with components a1, a2, a3,

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:12.920
then the length of a is the square root of a1 squared plus a2 squared

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:19.320
OK? Any questions about that?

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:23.620
Yes?

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:27.940
Does this kind of continue for value above a3?

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:33.220
Yes, so in general, indeed, can consider vectors in abstract spaces

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:37.000
that have any number of coordinates and then you have more components.

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:42.300
In this class, we'll mostly see vectors with two of three components only

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:45.660
because they're easier to draw, and because a lot of the map that we'll see

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:49.760
works exactly the same way, whether you have three variables or a million variables.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:54.360
If we had a vector with more components, then we would have a lot of trouble

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:58.420
drawing it, but we could still define its length in the same way by summing

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:03.960
the squares of the components. So I'm sorry to say that here, you know,

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:07.180
multi-variable, multi-will mean mostly two-off-free.

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:12.960
But be assured that it works just the same way if you have 10,000 variables.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.360
Just calculations are longer.

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:22.680
OK, more questions?

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.960
OK, so what else can we do with vectors?

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:32.980
Well, another thing that I'm sure you know how to do with vectors is to add them

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:41.400
or to scale them. So vector addition.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:50.760
So if you have two vectors, a and b, then you can form them some A plus B.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.920
How do we do that? Well, first, I should tell you, vectors, you know,

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.600
they have this double life. They are at the same time geometric objects

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:03.220
that we can draw like this on pictures. And they are also computational objects

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:08.220
that we can represent by numbers. So every question about vectors will have two answers,

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:12.520
one geometric and one numerical. OK, so let's start with a geometry.

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:17.040
So let's say that I have two vectors, A and B, given to me.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:22.700
And let's say that I thought of drawing them at the same place to start with.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:30.560
Well, to take the sum, what I should do is actually move B so that it starts at the end of A,

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:35.320
at the head of A. OK, so this is again vector B.

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:40.300
So observe, this actually forms now a parallelogram. Right?

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:48.200
So this side is again vector A. And now if we take the diagonal of that parallelogram,

00:11:51.740 --> 00:12:00.040
this is what we call A plus B. OK, so the idea being that to move along A plus B,

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:02.680
it's the same as to move first along A and then along B.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:12.320
Or along B, then along A. A plus B equals B plus A. OK, now if we do it numerically,

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:20.820
then all you do is you just add the first component of A with the first component of B,

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:30.700
the second with the second and the third with the third. OK, say that A was A1, A2, A3,

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:39.080
B was B1, B2, B3, then you just add this way. OK, so it's pretty straightforward.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:48.460
So for example, you know, I said that my vector over there, its components are 3 to 1,

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:54.380
but I also voted as 3 times I plus 2 times J plus K. What does that mean?

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:58.120
Oh, so I need to tell you first about multiplying by a scalar.

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:08.560
So, this is about addition. So multiplication by a scalar,

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:18.740
it's very easy. If you have a vector A, then you can form a vector 2A just by making it go twice as far in the same direction.

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:33.600
OK, or we can make half A more modestly. Or we can even make a minus A and so on. OK, so now you see if I do the calculation,

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:41.260
3 times I plus 2 times J plus K, well, what does it mean? 3 times I is just going to go along the x-axis,

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:50.460
but by distance of 3 instead of 1. And then 2 times J goes 2 units along the y-axis and K goes up by 1 unit.

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:58.860
Well, if you add these together, you will go from the origin, then along the x-axis, then parallel to the y-axis and then up.

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:09.540
And you will end up, indeed, at the end point of a vector A. OK, any questions at this point? Yes?

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:28.340
So for the G-measure vector, it shouldn't be basically choosing the accepted tail, the HEMs, the other way around.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:35.200
Any other questions? Yes?

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:44.080
That's correct. If you subtract 2 vectors, that just means you add the opposite of a vector.

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:50.820
So for example, if I wanted to do A minus B, I would first go along A and then along minus B, which would take me somewhere over there.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:55.540
OK, so A minus B, if you want, would go from here to here.

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:11.540
OK, so hopefully you've kind of seen that stuff either before in your lives or at least yesterday.

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:15.720
So I'm going to use that as an excuse to move quickly forward.

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:28.320
So now we're going to learn a few more operations about vectors.

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:33.840
And these operations will be useful to us when we start trying to do a bit of geometry.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:40.260
So of course, you've all done some geometry, but we're going to see that geometry can be done using vectors.

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:43.280
And actually, in many ways, it's the right language for that.

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:51.900
And in particular, when we learn about functions, we really want to use vectors more than maybe the other kind of geometry that you've seen before.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.500
And of course, it's just a language in a way.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:06.900
I mean, we are just reformulating things that you have seen, you already know since childhood, but you'll see that the notation somehow helps to make it maybe more straightforward.

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.260
So what is dot product?

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:16.640
Well, dot product is a way of multiplying two vectors to get a number, a scalar.

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:22.840
And well, let me start by giving you a definition in terms of components.

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:33.220
So what we do, let's say that we have a vector a with components a1, a2, a3, a vector b with components b1, b2, b3.

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:37.620
Well, we multiply the first component by the first component.

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:41.780
The second by the second, the third by the third.

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:47.100
If you have any components you keep going, and you sum all of these together.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.180
And important, this is a scalar.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.280
You do not get a vector. You get a number.

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:07.940
I know it sounds completely obvious from the definition here, but in the middle of action, when you're going to do complicated problems, it's sometimes easy to forget.

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:11.460
So that's a definition.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:16.700
What is it good for? Why would we ever want to do that?

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.680
That's kind of a strange operation.

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:25.540
So probably to see what it's good for, I should first tell you what it does geometrically.

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.040
So what does it do geometrically?

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:51.540
Well, what you do when you multiply two vectors in this way, I claim the answer is equal to the length of a times the length of b times the cosine of the angle between them.

00:17:53.060 --> 00:18:07.920
So if I have my vector a, and if I have my vector b, and I have some angle between them, I multiply the length of a times the length of b times the cosine of b.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:12.500
So that looks like a very artificial operation.

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:15.440
I mean, why would we want to do that complicated multiplication?

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:22.060
Well, the basic answer is it tells us at the same time about lengths and about angles.

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:26.800
And the extra bonus thing is that it's very easy to compute.

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:30.340
If you have a components, see, that formula is actually pretty easy.

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:38.740
So, okay, maybe I should first tell you how do we get this from that?

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:43.820
Because you know, in math one tries to justify everything to prove theorems.

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:46.460
So if you want that's a theorem, that's the first theorem in 1802.

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.880
So how do we prove that theorem?

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:53.240
How do we check that this is indeed correct using this definition?

00:18:56.780 --> 00:19:02.460
So, in more common language, what does this geometric definition mean?

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:14.400
Well, the first thing it means, you know, before we multiply two vectors, let's start multiplying a vector with itself.

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:15.460
That's probably easier.

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:22.020
So if we multiply a vector a with itself using this dot product, so by the way,

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:25.600
should point out we put this dot here, that's why it's called dot product.

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:40.600
So what this tells us is we should get the same thing as multiplying the length of a with itself, squared, times the cosine of the angle.

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:47.800
But now the cosine of an angle of zero, cosine of zero, you all know is one.

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:52.660
Okay? So that's going to be length a squared.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.040
Well, does that stand a chance of being true?

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:56.720
Well, let's see.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:06.700
If we do a dot a using this formula, we will get a1 squared plus a2 squared plus a3 squared, that is indeed the square of length.

So let's start right away with stuff

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.840
that we will need to see before we can go on to more advanced

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:27.160
things.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.000
So hopefully you start in recitation,

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.520
you heard a bit about vectors.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.820
How many of you actually knew about vectors before that?

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.140
OK, that's the vast majority.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.560
If you're not one of those people, well, hopefully,

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.320
you will learn about vectors right now.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.120
I'm sorry that the learning curve will be a bit steeper

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.200
for the first week, but hopefully, you will just find.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.200
If you have trouble with vectors,

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.380
do go to your recitation instructors

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.220
of this house for extra practice if you feel the need to.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.940
You'll see it's pretty easy.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:14.600
So just to remind you, a vector is a quantity that

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.340
has both a direction and a magnitude or length.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.300
So completely, the way you draw a vector

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.460
is by some hole like that.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.000
And so it has a length, and it's pointing in some direction.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.840
And so now the way that we compute things with vectors

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.900
typically is we introduce a coordinate system.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.020
So if we're in the plane x, y, x is, if we're in space, x, y, z,

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.260
x is, so usually I will try to draw my x, y, z, x is

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.040
consistently to look like this.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.800
And then I can represent my vector in terms of its components

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.680
along the coordinate axis.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.380
So that means when I have this arrow,

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.460
I can ask how much does it go in the x direction,

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.000
how much does it go in the y direction,

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.940
how much does it go in the z direction.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.760
And so, for example, let's call this a vector, a.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.500
So a small convention, when we have a vector quantity,

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.180
we put an arrow on top to remind us that it's a vector.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.920
If it's in a textbook, then sometimes it's

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.120
involved because it's easier to type set.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.480
If you've tried, in your favorite word processor,

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.580
there's bold is easy and vectors are not easy.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.200
So the vector, you can try to decompose in terms

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.080
of unit vectors directed along the coordinate axis.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.860
So the convention is there's a vector that we call i

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:07.680
hat that points along the x axis and has length 1.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.300
There's a vector called j hat that does the same along the y

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.940
axis and the k hat that does the same along the z axis.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.240
And so we can express any vector in terms of its components.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.460
So the other notation is a 1, a 2, a 3

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.700
between these square brackets.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.600
Well, maybe it's angular brackets.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:43.580
So the length of a vector will denote by,

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.320
if you want it, the same notation as the absolute value.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:47.860
So that's going to be a number.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.340
Or as we say now, a scalar quantity.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.680
So a scalar quantity is a usual numerical quantity,

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.140
as opposed to a vector quantity.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:07.920
And its direction is sometimes called the of a.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.840
And that can be obtained just by scaling the vector down

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.560
to unit length, for example, by dividing it by its length.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.340
So, well, there's a lot of notation to be learned.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.340
So for example, if I have 2 points p and q,

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.160
then I can draw a vector from p to q.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.860
And that vector is called vector pq.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.080
So maybe we'll call it a.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.080
But a vector doesn't really have necessarily a starting point

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.920
and an ending point.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.700
So if I decide to start here and I go by the same distance

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.080
in the same direction, this is also a vector a.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.100
It's the same vector.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.260
So a lot of vectors will draw starting at the origin,

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.400
but we don't have to.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:06.360
OK?

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:13.060
So let's just check and see how things went in recitation.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.560
When they could exist.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.380
So let's say that I give you the vector free to 1.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.500
And so what do you think about the length of this vector?

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:37.260
OK.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.000
OK.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.360
I see an answer forming.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.040
So a lot of you are answering the same thing.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.340
Maybe I shouldn't spoil it for those who haven't.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.540
Can you get it?

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:54.260
OK.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.940
I think the overwhelming vote is in favor of answer number 2.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.280
I see some successes.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:01.900
I don't know.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.320
That's a perfectly good answer, too.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.380
But hopefully, in a few minutes, it won't be,

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:07.660
I don't know anymore.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:10.760
So let's see.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:22.060
How do we find the length of a vector free to 1?

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:30.920
Well, so this vector A, it comes towards us along the x-axis

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.620
by three units.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.840
It goes to the right along the y-axis by two units.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.540
And then it goes up by one unit along the z-axis.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.340
OK?

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.660
So it's pointing towards here.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.080
That's pretty hard to draw.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.040
So how do we get its length?

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.560
Well, maybe we can start with something easier,

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.940
the length of a vector in the plane.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:03.900
So observe that A is obtained from a vector B in the plane.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:08.980
Let's say B equals 3i at plus 2j hat.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.260
And then we just have to still go up by one unit.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:14.200


00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.080
So let me try to draw a picture in this vertical plane

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.360
that contains A and B.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.700
If I draw it in the vertical plane, so that's the z-axis.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.600
That's not any particular axis.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:31.600
Then my vector B will go here.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.540
And my vector A will go above it.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.380
And here, that's one unit.

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:45.000
And here, I have a right angle.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.960
So I can use the Pythagorean theorem

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:55.320
to find that length A squared equals length B squared plus 1.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.440
Now, we are reduced to finding the length of B.

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.880
But the length of B, we can again find using the Pythagorean

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.720
theorem in the xy plane, because here we have the right angle.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.440
Here we have three units, and here we have two units.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.860
So if you do the calculations, you will see that

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:18.040
well, length of B is squared out of 3 squared plus 2 squared

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.180
that's 13, so squared out of 13.

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:35.200
And length of A is squared out of length B squared plus 1.

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:40.320
squared if you want, which is going to be

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:44.240
squared out of 13 plus 1 is squared out of 14.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:49.080
Hence, answer number 2, which almost all of you gave.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.440
So the general formula, if you follow what we did,

00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:04.880
in general, if we have a vector with components A1, A2,

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:12.060
A3, then the length of A is the square root of A1 squared

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.520
plus A2 squared plus A3 squared.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.500
Any questions about that?

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:23.660
Yes?

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.960
Does this kind of continue for value above A3?

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:32.740
Yes. So in general, indeed, can consider vectors in abstract

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:36.240
spaces that have any number of coordinates, and then you

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.020
have more components.

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:41.420
In this class, we'll mostly see vectors with two or three

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:44.300
components only, because they are easier to draw, and because

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.080
a lot of the map that we'll see works exactly the same way,

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.780
whether you have three variables or a million variables.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.880
If we had a vector with more components, then we would have

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.220
a lot of trouble drawing it, but we could still define

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:59.040
its length in the same way by summing the squares of

00:09:59.040 --> 00:09:59.420
the components.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:05.120
So I'm sorry to say that here, you know, multi variable,

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:09.980
multi will mean mostly two or three, but be

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.640
assured that it works just the same way if you have 10,000

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:12.960
variables.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.400
Just calculations are longer.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:20.460
Okay.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:22.720
More questions?

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:24.160
No.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:24.680
Okay.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.000
So what else can we do with vectors?

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:30.620
Well, another thing that I'm sure you know how to do with

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:35.160
vectors is to add them or to scale them.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.440
So vector addition.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:49.400
So if you have two vectors, A and B, then you can form them

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.000
some A plus B. How do we do that?

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.960
Well, first, I should tell you, vectors, you know,

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.000
they have this double life.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.460
They are at the same time geometric objects, but we can draw

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:02.660
like this on pictures, and they are also computational

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.020
objects that we can represent by numbers.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.240
So every question about vectors will have two answers,

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.780
one geometric and one numerical.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:12.540
Okay. So let's start with a geometry.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:17.080
So let's say that I have two vectors, A and B, given to me.

00:11:18.1000 --> 00:11:21.760
And let's say that I thought of drawing them at the same

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:22.780
place to start with.

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:28.980
Well, to take the sum, what I should do is actually move B so

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:32.080
that it starts at the end of A, at the head of A.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:35.360
Okay. So this is again vector B.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.620
So observe, this actually forms now a parallelogram.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.540
Right. So this side is again vector A.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.260
And now if we take the diagonal of that parallelogram,

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.620
this is what we call A plus B.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:00.060
Okay. So the idea being that to move along A plus B,

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.700
it's the same as to move first along A and then along B.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:07.460
Or along A, A plus B equals B plus A.

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:12.320
Okay. Now if we do it numerically,

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:19.540
then all you do is you just add the first component of A

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:23.180
with the first component of B, the second with the second,

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:24.460
and the third with the third.

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:35.240
Okay. Say that A was A1, A2, A3, B was B1, B2, B3,

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.120
then you just add this way.

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:39.120
Okay. So it's pretty straightforward.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:46.500
So for example, you know, I said that my vector over there,

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:52.100
its components are 3 to 1, but I also voted as 3 times I

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:54.420
plus 2 times J plus K. What does that mean?

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:58.160
Oh. So I need to tell you first about multiplying by a scalar.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.520
So, this is about addition.

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:09.480
So multiplication by a scalar, it's very easy.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:15.560
If you have a vector A, then you can form a vector 2A

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.780
just by making it go twice as far in the same direction.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.300
Okay. Or we can make half A more than this clean.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:28.940
Or we can even make minus A and so on.

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:30.320
Okay.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:35.040
So now you see if I do the calculation, 3 times I

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.900
plus 2 times J plus K, well what does it mean?

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.300
3 times I is just going to go along the x-axis,

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.140
but by distance of 3 instead of 1.

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:48.240
And then 2 times J goes 2 units along the y-axis,

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.500
and K goes up by 1 unit.

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:54.280
Well, if you add these together, you will go from the origin,

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:58.320
then along the x-axis, then parallel to the y-axis,

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.620
and then up, and you will end up, indeed,

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.860
at the end point of a vector A.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.160
Okay. Any questions at this point?

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:09.580
Yes?

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:13.320
So for the G-measure vector,

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:17.260
it shouldn't be basically choosing the excepted tail,

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:18.820
the same tail.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:21.160
Exactly. To add vectors geometrically,

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.680
you just put the head of the first vector

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.340
and the tail of the second vector in the same place,

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:28.320
and then it's head to tail addition.

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:32.940
Any other questions?

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:35.220
Yes?

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:39.080
So I'm just chatting with this to the one that I mentioned.

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:42.040
That's correct. If you subtract two vectors,

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:44.100
that just means you add the opposite of a vector.

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:46.160
So for example, if I wanted to do A minus B,

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.420
I would first go along A, and then along minus B,

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.860
which would take me somewhere over there.

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:54.380
Okay. So A minus B, if you want,

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:55.560
that would go from here to here.

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:00.860
Okay.

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:01.060


00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:08.340
So, well, hopefully you've kind of seen that stuff either,

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.540
you know, before in your lives, or at least yesterday.

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.740
So I'm going to use it as an excuse to move quickly forward.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:16.300
But,

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:23.660
so,

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:28.360
now we're going to learn a few more operations about vectors.

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:33.860
And these operations will be useful to us when we start trying to do a bit of geometry.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.020
So of course, you've all done some geometry,

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:40.300
but we're going to see that geometry can be done using vectors.

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.320
And actually, in many ways, it's the right language for that.

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.740
And in particular, when we learn about functions,

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:50.160
we really want to use vectors more than, maybe, you know,

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:51.940
the other kind of geometry that you've seen before.

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.540
I mean, of course, it's just a language in a way.

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.700
I mean, we are just reformulating things that you have seen,

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:01.280
you already know since childhood,

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:06.940
but you'll see that in notation somehow helps to make it maybe more straightforward.

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.300
So what is that product?

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:16.640
Well, that product is a way of multiplying two vectors to get a number, a scalar.

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:22.860
And, well, let me start by giving you a definition in terms of components.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.300
So what we do, let's say that we have a vector A with components A1, A2, A3,

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.260
a vector B with components B1, B2, B3.

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:37.660
Well, we multiply the first component by the first component,

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.720
the second by the second, the third by the third.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.340
If you have n components, you keep going,

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:47.120
and you sum all of these together.

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:52.220
And important, this is a scalar.

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:57.300
You do not get a vector. You get a number.

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:00.960
I know it sounds completely obvious from the definition here,

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:04.780
but, you know, in the middle of action, you know,

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:07.980
when you're going to do complicated problems, it's sometimes easy to forget.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:11.500
So that's a definition.

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:16.720
What is it good for? Why would we ever want to do that?

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.740
That's kind of a strange operation.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:25.580
So probably to see what it's good for, I should first tell you what it does geometrically.

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.060
So what does it do geometrically?

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:42.100
Well, what you do when you multiply two vectors in this way,

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:49.760
I claim the answer is equal to the length of A times the length of B times the cosine

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.620
of the angle between them.

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:55.020
So if I have my vector A,

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:03.440
and if I have my vector B, and I have some angle between them,

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:08.700
I multiply the length of A times the length of B times the cosine of that angle.

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:12.540
So that looks like a very artificial operation.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.480
I mean, why would we want to do that complicated multiplication?

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:21.360
Well, the basic answer is it tells us at the same time about lengths

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:26.840
and about angles. And the extra bonus thing is that it's very easy to compute.

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:30.360
If you have a component, see that formula is actually pretty easy.

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:38.820
So maybe I should first tell you how do we get this from that?

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:43.880
Because you know, in math one tries to justify everything to prove theorems.

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:46.420
So if you want that's a theorem, that's the first theorem in 1802.

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:48.920
So how do we prove that theorem?

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:53.280
How do we check that this is indeed correct using this definition?

00:18:56.780 --> 00:19:02.520
So in more common language, what does this geometric definition mean?

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:12.480
Well, the first thing it means, you know, before we multiply two vectors,

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.440
let's start multiplying a vector with itself.

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:15.500
That's probably easier.

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:21.020
So if we multiply a vector A with itself using this dot product,

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:25.620
so by the way, should point out we put this dot here, that's what it's called, dot product.

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:36.780
So what this tells us is we should get the same thing as multiplying the length of A with itself,

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:44.980
so squared, times the cosine of the angle, but now the cosine of an angle of zero,

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.840
cosine of zero, you all know is one.

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:52.700
So that's going to be length A squared.

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.080
Well, does that stand a chance of being true?

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:56.760
Well, let's see.

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:03.400
If we do A dot A using this formula, we will get A1 squared plus A2 squared plus A3 squared,

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.760
that is indeed the square of length.
>>>>>>> 67c7a8d1f5bac80a7e910dd3aefd4eafb3ea5c68

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.620
So check, that works.

<<<<<<< HEAD
00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:18.160
Okay? Now what about two different vectors?

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:22.960
Can we understand what this says and how it relates to that?

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:38.180
So let's say that I have two different vectors a and b, and I want to try to understand what's going on.

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:49.600
So my claim is that we are going to be able to understand the relation between this and that in terms of the law of cosines.

00:20:50.220 --> 00:21:00.900
So the law of cosines is something that tells you about the length of the third side in a triangle like this in terms of these two sides and the angle here.

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:14.120
Okay? So the law of cosines, which hopefully you have seen before, says that, so let me give a name to this side.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:24.000
Let's call this side c. And as a vector, c is a minus b. It's minus b plus a.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:34.680
Okay? So, let's get a little bit closer here.

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:52.960
So the law of cosines, says that the length of the third side in this triangle is equal to length a squared plus length b squared.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:22:03.080
Well, if I stopped here, that would be Pythagoras, but I don't have a right angle. So I have a third term, which is twice length a length b cosine theta.

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:09.500
Okay? Has everyone seen this formula sometime?

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:20.860
Yeah. No. I hear some, yes. I hear some, no. Well, it's a fact about, I mean, you probably haven't seen it with vectors, but it's a fact about the side lengths in a triangle.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:31.960
And, well, I'm not sure that I, well, let's say if you haven't seen it before, then this is going to be a proof of the law of cosines.

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:35.360
If you believe this, otherwise it's the other way around.

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:45.700
So let's try to see how this relates to what I'm saying about the dot product.

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:56.940
So I've been saying that length c squared, that's the same thing as c dot c. Okay? That we have checked.

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:07.360
Now, c dot c, well, c is a minus b. So it's a minus b dot product a minus b.

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:16.920
What do we want to do in a situation like that? Well, we want to expand this into a sum of four terms. How we allow to do that?

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:24.340
Well, you know, we have this dot product. It's a mysterious new operation. We don't really know. Well, the answer is yes, we can do it.

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:32.180
You can check from this definition that it behaves in the usual way in terms of expanding, factoring, and so on.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:47.140
So I can write that as a dot a minus a dot b minus b dot a plus b dot b.

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:59.040
So a dot a is length a squared. Let me jump ahead to the last term b dot b is length b squared.

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:07.280
And then these two terms, well, they're the same. You can check from the definition that a dot b or b dot a are the same thing.

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:14.000
So there's no hidden trick here. This is really minus twice a dot b.

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:28.400
So now let's compare these two formulas. Well, you see that this term is, I mean, this is the only difference between these two formulas for the length of c.

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:38.440
So if you believe in the law of cosines, then it tells you that yes, this is a proof that a dot b equals length a length b cosine theta.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:49.800
Or this versa, if you've never seen the law of cosines, but you're willing to believe this, then this is the proof of the law of cosines.

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:55.140
So the law of cosines are this interpretation of equivalent to each other.

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:02.960
Okay, any questions? Yes?

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.600
Why is it that cosine theta is not sine theta?

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:13.080
So in the second one, there isn't a cosine theta because I'm just expanding a dot product.

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:19.540
Okay, so I'm just, you know, writing c equals a minus b. And then I'm expanding this algebraically.

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:28.560
And then I get to an answer that has an a dot b. So then if I wanted to express that without a dot product, then I would have to introduce a cosine and I would get the same as there.

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:39.840
Okay? So yeah, if you want the next step to recover the law of cosines, it would be to plug in this formula for a dot b. And then you would have a cosine.

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:47.220
Okay, let's keep going.

00:25:55.420 --> 00:26:04.260
Okay, so what is this good for now that we have a definition, we should figure out what we can do with it.

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:09.640
So what are the applications of that product?

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:14.800
Well, we'll discover new applications of that product throughout the entire semester.

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:18.420
But let me tell you at least about those that are readily visible.

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:29.140
So one is to compute lengths and angles, especially angles.

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:34.400
So let's do an example.

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:49.040
Let's say that, for example, I have in space, I have a point p, which is at 1,00.

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:55.180
I have a point q, which is at 0,10.

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:57.700
So it's at distance 1 here, 1 here.

00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:03.260
And I have a third point r at 0,02. So it's at height 2.

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:10.100
And let's say that I'm curious and I'm wondering what is the angle.

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:17.580
So if I have a triangle in space, connecting p, q, and r, and I'm wondering what is this angle here?

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:24.620
Okay, so of course, one solution is to build a model and then go and measure the angle.

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:26.340
But we can do better than that.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.160
We can just find the angle using that product.

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:30.600
So how would we do that?

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:43.880
Well, so if we look at this formula, we see, so let's say that we want to find the angle here,

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:48.260
well, let's look at the formula for pq.pr.

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:56.840
Well, we said it should be length pq times length pr times the cosine of the angle.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.080
Now, what do we know and what do we not know?

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:04.300
Well, certainly at this point, we don't know the cosine of the angle.

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:05.580
That's what we would like to find.

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.180
But the length, certainly we can compute.

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:10.760
We know how to find these lengths.

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:15.240
And this dot product, we know how to compute because we have an easy formula here.

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:19.800
Okay, so we can compute everything else and then find theta.

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:28.060
So actually what we will do is we will find theta in this way.

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:35.680
We'll take the dot product of pq with pr and then we'll divide by the length.

00:28:40.760 --> 00:29:10.740
So, we'll take the dot product of pq and then we'll find the angle.

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:10.740


00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:10.740


00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:18.720
Okay, so let's see.

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:31.820
So we say the cosine theta is pq dot pr over length pq length pr.

00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:35.800
So let's try to figure out what is vector pq.

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:44.060
Well, to go from pq, I should go minus one unit along the x direction plus one unit along the y direction.

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.160
And I'm not moving in the z direction.

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:52.580
So to go from pq, I have to move by minus one one zero.

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:59.720
To go from p to r, I go minus one along the x axis and plus two along the z axis.

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.740
So pr, I claim is this.

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:04.240


00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:14.460
Then the length of these vectors, well, we take minus one squared plus one squared plus zero squared,

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:17.780
square root, and then same thing with the other one.

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:20.880
Okay.

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:28.020
So if a denominator will become, well, there's a square root of two and there's a square root of five.

00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:30.700
What about the numerator?

00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:39.740
Well, so remember to do the dot product, we multiply this by this and that by that, that by that.

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:48.200
And we add minus one times minus one makes one plus one times zero, that's zero.

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.980
Zero times two is zero again.

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:54.400
So we will get one of our square root of ten.

00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:56.220
Okay.

00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:58.360
That's the cosine of the angle.

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:00.700
And of course, if we want the actual angle,

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:06.200
well, we have to take a calculator, find the inverse cosine,

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:09.840
and you'll find that it's about 71.5 degrees.

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:14.600
Actually, we'll be using mostly radians, but for today,

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:17.980
I mean, that's certainly a more speaking answer.

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:23.200
Okay. Any questions about that?

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:31.480
Okay. So in particular, I should point out one thing that's really neat about the answer.

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.720
See, I mean, we got this number.

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:38.360
We don't really know what it means exactly because it makes this together over the length and the angle.

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:42.520
But one thing's interesting here, it's the sign of the answer.

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:45.060
The fact that we got a positive number.

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:49.320
So if you think about it, the lengths are always positive.

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:55.140
So the sign of the dot product is the same as the sign of cosine theta.

00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:58.720
So, in fact,

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:15.200
the sign of a dot b is going to be positive if the angle is less than 90 degrees.

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:16.700
So that means geometrically,

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:20.600
my two vectors are going more or less in the same direction.

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:21.980
They make an acute angle.

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:28.700
It's going to be zero if the angle is exactly 90 degrees.

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:28.700


00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:34.660
Okay. Because that's when the cosine will be zero.

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:40.100
And it will be negative if the angle is more than 90 degrees.

00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:43.320
So that means they go other in opposite directions.

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:51.040
Okay. So that's basically one way to think about what dot product measures.

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:54.520
It measures how much the two vectors are going along each other.

00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:56.900
Okay.

00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:00.080
And that actually leads us to the next application.

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:03.900
So let's see, did I have a number one there?

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.720
Yes. So if I had a number one, I must have a number two.

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:13.640
The second application is to detect orthogonality.

00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:17.220
It's to figure out when two things are perpendicular.

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:24.120
Okay. So orthogonality is just a complicated word from Greek to say things are perpendicular.

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:29.180
So let's just take an example.

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:35.920
Let's say I give you the equation x plus 2y plus 3z equals zero.

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:42.520
Okay. So that defines a certain number, a certain set of points in space.

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:49.480
And what do you think the set of solutions looks like if I give you this equation?

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:54.440
So far I see one, two, three answers.

00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:56.880
Okay.

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:04.540
So I see various competing answers.

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:05.820
But.

00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:14.200
Yeah. I see a lot of people voting for answer number four.

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:19.020
I see also some, I don't know and some other things.

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:23.020
But the majority vote seems to be a claim.

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:24.940
And indeed that's the correct answer.

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:28.380
So how do we see that it's a claim?

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:46.120
So I should say this is the equation of a claim.

00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:51.480
So there's many ways to see that.

00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:55.260
And I'm not going to give you all of them.

00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:55.260


00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:55.640
So let's say I give you all of them.

00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:57.040
But here's one way to think about it.

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:04.880
So let's think geometrically about how to express this condition in terms of vectors.

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:11.880
So let's say let's take the origin, you know, O by convention is the point zero, zero, zero.

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:17.760
And let's take a point P that will satisfy this equation or not.

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.140
So it coordinates XYZ.

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:24.180
So what does this condition here mean?

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:27.740
Well, it means the following thing.

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:30.300
So let's take a vector OP.

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:36.460
Okay. So vector OP of course has components XYZ.

00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:44.720
Now we can think of this as actually a dot product between OP and a mysterious vector

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:49.080
that may be mysterious for very long, namely the vector 1, 2, 3.

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:59.680
So this condition is the same as OP.A equals zero.

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:07.160
If I take the dot product OP.A, I get X times 1 plus Y times 2 plus Z times 3.

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:13.880
But now what does it mean that the dot product between OP and A is zero?

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:17.120
Well, it means that OP and A are perpendicular.

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:27.460
Okay. So I have this vector A. I'm not going to bother to draw it realistically.

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:29.420
Let's say it goes for example this way.

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:37.860
Then a point P solves this equation exactly when the vector from O to P is perpendicular to A.

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:40.640
And they claim that defines a plane.

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:43.920
For example, if it helps you to see it, take a vertical vector.

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:47.240
What does it mean to be perpendicular to the vertical vector?

00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:49.820
It means your horizontal. It's the horizontal plane.

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:56.740
Here it's a plane that passes through the origin and is perpendicular to this vector A.

00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:21.440
Okay. So what we get is plane of the origin perpendicular to this guy.

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:37.060
And in general what you should remember is that two vectors have a dot product equal to zero.

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:42.600
If and only if that's equivalent to cosine of the angle between them is zero.

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:49.220
That means the angle is 90 degrees. That means A and B are perpendicular.

00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:54.240
So we have a very fast way of checking whether two vectors are perpendicular.

00:37:56.860 --> 00:38:09.180
Okay. So one additional application I think we'll see that actually tomorrow is to find the components of a vector along a certain direction.

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:25.500
So I claim we can use this intuition I gave about dot product telling us how much two vectors go in the same direction to actually give a precise meaning to the notion of component for vector not just along the x, y, or the x's, but along any direction in space.

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:38.580
So I think I should probably stop here, but I will see you tomorrow at two here and we'll learn more about that and about cross product.
=======
00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.200
Now, what about two different vectors?

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:23.000
Can we understand what this says and how it relates to that?

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:33.020
So let's say that I have two different vectors, A and B,

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:38.240
and I want to try to understand what's going on.

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:47.620
So my claim is that we are going to be able to understand the relation between Vase and Vat

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:49.620
in terms of the low of cosines.

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:56.700
So the low of cosines is something that tells you about the length of a third side in a triangle

00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:00.940
like this in terms of these two sides and the angle here.

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:09.680
So the low of cosines, which hopefully you have seen before,

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:14.200
says that, so let me give a name to this side.

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:21.660
Let's call this side C. And as a vector, C is A minus B.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.060
It's minus B plus A.

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:34.580
So let's get a little bit here.

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:53.000
So the low of cosines says that the length of a third side in this triangle is equal to length A squared plus length B squared.

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:55.140
Well, if I stopped here, that would be Pythagoras.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.640
But I don't have a right angle.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:03.120
So I have a third term, which is twice length A, length B cosine theta.

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:09.040
Has everyone seen this formula?

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:13.520
Yeah, no, I hear some notes.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:17.480
Well, it's a fact about, I mean, you probably haven't seen it with vectors.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:20.880
But it's a fact about the side lengths in a triangle.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:28.220
And well, I'm not sure that I, well, let's say if you haven't seen it before,

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:32.000
then this is going to be a proof of the low of cosines.

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:35.380
If you believe this, otherwise it's the other way around.

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:45.720
So let's try to see how this relates to what I'm saying about the dot product.

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:54.180
So I've been saying that length C squared, that's the same thing as C dot C.

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.020
Okay? That we have checked.

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:02.480
Now, C dot C, well, C is A minus B.

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:07.400
So it's A minus B dot product, A minus B.

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:11.180
What do we want to do in a situation like that?

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:14.800
Well, we want to expand this into a sum of four terms.

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:16.880
Are we allowed to do that?

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:20.320
Well, you know, we have this dot product.

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.280
It's a mysterious new operation. We don't really know.

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.360
Well, the answer is, yes, we can do it.

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:32.220
You can check from this definition that it behaves in the usual way in terms of expanding, factoring, and so on.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:47.200
So I can write that as A dot A minus A dot B minus B dot A plus B dot B.

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:53.540
So A dot A is length A squared.

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:56.300
Let me jump ahead to the last term.

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.060
B dot B is length B squared.

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:03.160
And then these two terms, well, they're the same.

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:07.300
You can check from the definition that A dot B or B dot A are the same thing.

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:11.380
So there's no hidden trick here.

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:14.040
This is really minus twice A dot B.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.420
So now, let's compare these two formulas.

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:28.440
Well, you see that this term is, I mean, this is the only difference between these two formulas for the length of C.

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:38.460
So if you believe in the law of cosines, then it tells you that yes, this is a proof that A dot B equals length A, length B cosine theta.

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:49.840
Or this versa, if you've never seen the law of cosines, but you're willing to believe this, then this is the proof of the law of cosines.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:55.180
Okay, so the law of cosines are this interpretation of equivalent to each other.

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.540
Okay, any questions?

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:03.000
Yes?

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.640
Why is it that cosine theta is now sine theta?

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:13.140
So in the second one, there isn't a cosine theta because I'm just expanding a dot product.

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:19.560
Okay, so I'm just, you know, writing C equals A minus B, and then I'm expanding this algebraically.

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:22.180
And then I get to an answer that has an A dot B.

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:28.660
So then if I wanted to express that without a dot product, then I would have to introduce a cosine and I would get the same as there.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:29.720
Okay?

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:39.880
So yeah, if you want the next step to recover the law of cosines would be to plug in this formula for A dot B, and then you would have a cosine.

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:47.240
Okay, let's keep going.

00:25:55.580 --> 00:26:01.340
Okay, so what is this good for?

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:04.280
Now that we have a definition, we should figure out what we can do with it.

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:09.660
So what are the applications of that product?

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:14.840
Well, will this cover new applications of that product throughout the entire semester?

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:18.460
But let me tell you at least about those that are readily visible.

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:29.140
So one is to compute lengths and angles, especially angles.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.440
So let's do an example.

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:49.080
Let's say that, for example, I have in space, I have a point P, which is at 1,00.

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:55.240
I have a point Q, which is at 0,10.

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:57.740
So it's at distance 1 here, 1 here.

00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:01.980
And I have a third point R at 0,0,2.

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:03.300
So it's at height 2.

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:10.140
And let's say that I'm curious and I'm wondering what is the angle.

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:17.600
So if I have a triangle in space, connecting P, Q, and R, and I'm wondering what is this angle here?

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:20.220
Okay?

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:24.660
So of course, one solution is to build a model and then go and measure the angle.

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:26.380
But we can do better than that.

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:29.160
We can just find the angle using that product.

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:30.640
So how would we do that?

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:43.900
Well, so if we look at this formula, we see, so let's say, that we want to find the angle here,

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:48.280
well, let's look at the formula for PQ dot PR.

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:56.880
Well, we said it should be length PQ times length PR times the cosine of the angle.

00:27:58.360 --> 00:27:58.400
Okay?

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:01.120
Now, what do we know and what do we not know?

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:04.320
Well, certainly at this point, we don't know the cosine of the angle.

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:05.620
That's what we would like to find.

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.200
But the length, certainly we can compute.

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:10.820
We know how to find these lengths.

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:15.260
And this dot product, we know how to compute because we have an easy formula here.

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:19.820
Okay? So we can compute everything else and then find theta.

00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:28.120
So actually what we will do is we will find theta in this way.

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:35.760
We will take the dot product of PQ with PR and then we will divide by the lengths.

00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:14.500
Okay?

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:18.760
Okay? So, let's see.

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:31.820
So we say the cosine theta is PQ dot PR over length PQ, length PR.

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:35.860
So let's try to figure out what is vector PQ.

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:44.080
Well, to go from PQ, I should go minus one unit along the x direction plus one unit along the y direction.

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:46.180
And I'm not moving in the z direction.

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:52.620
So to go from PQ, I have to move by minus one one zero.

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:59.760
To go from P to R, I go minus one along the x axis and plus two along the z axis.

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:02.760
So PR, I claim, is this.

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:14.840
Okay? Then the lengths of these vectors, well, we take minus one squared plus one squared plus zero squared squared,

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:17.820
square root, and then same thing with the other one.

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:28.060
Okay? So if a denominator will become, well, there's a square root of two and there's a square root of five.

00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:39.780
What about the numerator? Well, so remember to do the dot product, we multiply this by this and that by that, that by that.

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:48.240
And we add minus one times minus one makes one plus one times zero, that's zero.

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:54.440
Zero times two is zero again. So we will get one of our square root of ten.

00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:00.700
Okay? That's the cosine of the angle. And of course, if we want the actual angle,

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:09.880
well, we have to take a calculator, find the inverse cosine, and you'll find that it's about 71.5 degrees.

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:18.200
Actually, we'll be using mostly radians, but for today, I mean, that's certainly a more speaking and so on.

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:31.500
Okay? Any questions about that? No? Okay, so in particular, I should point out one thing that's really neat about the answer.

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:38.400
See, I mean, we got this number. We don't really know what it means exactly because it makes this together of the length and the angle.

00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:45.100
But one thing's interesting here, it's the sign of the answer, the fact that we got a positive number.

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:55.180
So if you think about it, the lengths are always positive. So the sign of the dot product is the same as the sign of cosine theta.

00:31:56.860 --> 00:32:15.240
So, in fact, the sign of A dot B is going to be positive if the angle is less than 90 degrees.

00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:22.060
So that means, geometrically, my two vectors are going more or less in the same direction. We make an acute angle.

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:29.020
It's going to be zero if the angle is exactly 90 degrees.

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:34.700
Okay? Because that's when the cosine will be zero.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.160
And it will be negative if the angle is more than 90 degrees.

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:43.320
So that means we go over in opposite directions.

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:51.080
Okay? So that's basically one way to think about what dot product measures.

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:54.560
It measures how much the two vectors are going along each other.

00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:00.120
And that actually leads us to the next application.

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:07.760
So let's see, did I have a number one there? Yes. So if I had a number one, I must have a number two.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:17.300
The second application is to detect orthogonality. It's to figure out when two things are perpendicular.

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:24.140
Okay? So orthogonality is just a complicated word from Greek to say things are perpendicular.

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:35.960
So let's just take an example. Let's say I give you the equation x plus 2y plus 3z equals zero.

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:42.580
Okay? So that defines a certain number, a certain set of points in space.

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:49.520
And what do you think the set of solutions looks like if I give you this equation?

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:54.500
So far I see one, two, three answers.

00:33:56.280 --> 00:34:04.620
Okay? So I see various competing answers.

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:14.260
But yeah, I see a lot of people voting for answer number four.

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:19.040
I see also some, I don't know and some other things.

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:23.060
But the majority vote seems to be a plane.

00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:24.980
And indeed that's the correct answer.

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.420
So how do we see that it's a plane?

00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:46.120
So I should say this is the equation of a plane.

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:51.520
So there's many ways to see that.

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:57.080
And I'm not going to give you all of them, but here's one way to think about it.

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:04.920
So let's think geometrically about how to express this condition in terms of vectors.

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:11.880
So let's say, let's take the origin, you know, O by convention is the point zero, zero, zero.

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:17.760
And let's take a point P that will satisfy this equation or not.

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:20.160
So it coordinates x, y, z.

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:24.200
So what does this condition here mean?

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:27.760
Well, it means the following thing.

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.400
So let's take the vector O P.

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:36.460
Okay, so vector O P, of course, has components x, y, z.

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:44.760
Now we can think of this as actually a dot product between O P and a mysterious vector

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:49.120
that may be mysterious for very long, namely the vector 1, 2, 3.

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:59.720
So this condition is the same as O P dot A equals zero.

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:07.200
If I take the dot product O P dot A, I get x times 1 plus y times 2 plus z times 3.

00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:13.900
But now, what does it mean that the dot product between O P and A is zero?

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:17.100
Well, it means that O P and A are perpendicular.

00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:22.260
Okay?

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:27.500
So I have this vector A. I'm not going to bother to draw it realistically.

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:29.440
Let's say it goes, for example, this way.

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:37.880
Then a point of P solves this equation exactly when the vector from O to P is perpendicular to A.

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:40.660
And they claim that defines a plane.

00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:43.980
For example, if it helps you to see it, take a vertical vector.

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:47.280
What does it mean to be perpendicular to the vertical vector?

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:48.480
It means your horizontal.

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:49.860
It's the horizontal plane.

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:56.780
Here it's a plane that passes through the origin and is perpendicular to this vector A.

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:03.440
Okay?

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:21.480
So what we get is plane for the origin perpendicular to this guy.

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:37.100
And in general, what you should remember is that two vectors have a dot product equal to zero.

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:42.640
If and only if that's equivalent to cosine of the angle between them is zero.

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:45.740
That means the angle is 90 degrees.

00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:49.260
That means A and B are perpendicular.

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:54.320
So we have a very fast way of checking whether two vectors are perpendicular.

00:37:57.300 --> 00:37:57.460
Okay.

00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:09.200
So one additional application, I think we'll see that actually tomorrow, is to find the components of a vector along a certain direction.

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:19.240
So I claim we can use this intuition I gave about dot product telling us how much two vectors go in the same direction to actually give a precise meaning to the number of vectors.

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:25.460
So the number of components of a vector not just along the x, y, or z axis, but along any direction in space.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.160
So I think I should probably stop here.

00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:35.000
But I will see you tomorrow at two here.

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:38.600
And we'll learn more about that and about cross product.
