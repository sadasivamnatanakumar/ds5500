WEBVTT

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:20.960
So we proved these two theorems last time and we used them for, and we had a couple applications

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:21.440
of them.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.540
So the first theorem, simple theorem was that a sequence converges to x if and only if

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.900
the limit as n goes to infinity of the absolute value of x and minus x goes to 0.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.740
And then we also had the squeeze theorem that if you have two, if you have three sequences,

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.140
a sub n, b sub n and x sub n so that x sub n is in between a sub n and b sub n.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.220
And the a sub n and b sub n converge to the same thing.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:55.340
Then the sequence x sub n converges and it converges to the common limit of a sub n and

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.940
b sub n.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.600
So x sub n gets squeezed in between a sub n and b sub n.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:19.380
And last time we used this to prove a kind of special limit that this equals 0.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.800
If the absolute value of c is less than 1, so I had proved it for c positive and maybe

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.740
c less than 1, but the same proof works with absolute values just because the absolute

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.280
value of c to the n equals the absolute value of c raised to the nth power.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.480
So let's use this to do a few more special limits if you like.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.720
But first I'm going to state the binomial theorem.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:00.780
I'm not going to prove it, but it's a simple exercise using induction.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:13.480
And the binomial theorem says that we'll all end in natural numbers.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:25.140
x, y and r, x plus y raised to the n is equal to the sum from k equals 0 to n of n choose

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.780
k, x to the n minus k, y to the k.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:44.360
And here n choose k, this is equal to n factorial over k factorial divided by n minus times

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.640
n minus k factorial.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.900
So again, you can prove this by inducting on n.

00:02:59.1000 --> 00:03:05.900
So we have a theorem, so we'll prove a few special limits.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.440
I have a real number that's positive.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:24.100
Then the limit as n goes to infinity of 1 over n to the p equals 0.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:41.300
If p is positive, then limit as n goes to infinity of p to the 1 over n equals 1.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:54.600
And the third is, it's just that a certain limit exists.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.440
Limit as n goes to infinity of n to the 1 over n equals 1.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.860
Let me make a small comment here.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:19.360
So so far in our discussion of the real numbers, we've kind of only defined what it means to take a real number to an integer power.

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.660
But and in through.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.320
So we have in powers and in roots.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:35.400
So using that, we can then define how to take a real number to a rational power.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:44.800
Although there needs to be something that's checked to make sure this is well defined because you can always write a rational number at, you know, not uniquely as one integer over another.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:05:00.200
So we can define a positive real number to a rational power.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:09.360
But, you know, using really only the elementary facts about the real numbers, the fact that it has a least upper bound property.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:23.660
And the fact that the rationals are somehow dense in the real numbers, we can then define what it means to take a positive real number to a positive real number power.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:37.100
Okay. All of that is just to say that to define a positive real number to a positive real number or to a real number power doesn't require the introduction of the exponential or logarithm.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:43.580
Although they, in the end, to agree, they both agree once you do have the exponential and the logarithm.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:51.440
So all of that is just to say that what we've done up to now, these things actually do make sense.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:06:00.520
You don't need the exponential and the logarithm to make sense of a positive real number to a real number power.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:07.360
Okay. But we're just going to use the basic properties of exponents throughout all this.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:14.040
So we don't, I mean, we haven't even talked about continuity or derivatives or anything like that.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.220
So we'll just use elementary means to be able to prove these statements.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:19.680
Okay.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:40.840
So for the first one, we'll prove this actually just using the definition of the limit, which remember means for every epsilon positive there, we should be able to find a capital number m such that if n is bigger than or equal to capital m, one over into the p is less than epsilon.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:07:04.940
So, an epsilon to be positive, choose m a natural number such that m is greater than or equal to is greater than one over epsilon to the one over p.

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:07.620
Okay.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:24.980
And if n is bigger than or equal to m, one over into the p minus zero, which equals one over into the p. This is less than or equal to one over capital m to the p.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:43.140
So here, again, I'm using kind of an elementary fact that we all know is that if I have a positive power here, then, and little n is bigger than or equal to capital m than into the p would be bigger than or equal to m capital m to the p.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:58.020
We do know that for integer exponents, but just trust me that one can define non-entered exponents and that inequality remains true as long as the power that you're using is positive.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:08.240
So I have one over into the p is less than or equal to one over capital m to the p. And by our choice of capital m, this is less than epsilon.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.080
Okay. So that proves number one.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:26.460
So number two, we really only need to do kind of two cases. One is, you know, p. So p equals one is fine.

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:42.520
This is clear because then I just get one for the whole sequence. So that's one case. Now let me do p bigger than one.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:57.720
Okay. And if p is bigger than one, the absolute value of p to the one over n minus one, this is just p to the one over n minus one.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:03.300
And so I want to show that this quantity here goes to zero. Okay.

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:21.880
Okay. Then, so we have an inequality which we proved actually in the second lecture, I think, using induction, but you can actually get from binomial theorem as well is.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:32.680
So let me just recall this right here that we had this inequality that if x is bigger than or equal to minus one, then one plus x.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:38.860
So this is the case. Race to the n is bigger than or equal to one plus n x. Okay.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:56.740
And so we use this inequality now with x equals p minus one. So p, this is equal to one plus p to the one over n minus one.

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:13.920
So now, raise to the nth power. I'm sorry, x is p to the one over n minus one, not p minus one. And now we use this inequality. This is bigger than or equal to this thing times n plus one.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:36.620
So then I'll go over here. So now, subtracting the one and divided by n tells me that p to the one over n minus one is less than or equal to p minus one over n.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:46.740
And as we noted here, since p is bigger than one, this is bigger than or equal to zero. Okay. And now we apply the squeeze theorem.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:11:00.280
By squeeze theorem, this is just going to zero. p minus one divided by n. That's just the number over n. This goes to zero as n goes to infinity.

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:14.160
And in fact, that's contained in number one for p equals one. And also by our limit facts that we proved from last time that the limit respects algebraic operations of the real numbers.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:37.240
So by the squeeze theorem, since this converges to zero and this converges to zero, this converges to zero, which implies that.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:53.740
Okay. So that deals with the case. p is bigger than one. To deal with p less than one, we use the case p bigger than one. And again, the fact that limits respect algebraic operations.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:12.380
And we write the limit as p. Let's look at p and make that better. The limit as n goes to infinity of p to the one over n. Now p is less than one.

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:23.380
So one over p is bigger than one. This is equal to the limit as n goes to infinity of one over one over p to the one over n.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:37.840
And now one over p is bigger than one. Raise to the one over n power. Converges to one by the case we did before. And so one over this converges to one over one equals one.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:13:05.520
Okay. Okay. So let me just remark that although we did prove this inequality for by induction, it actually follows from the binomial theorem.

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:15.300
And we'll use the binomial theorem to get a little bit of a different inequality that we'll use for number three.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:24.300
So for number three, we want to prove limit as n goes to infinity of n over one over n equals one.

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:45.020
So rather than keep writing into the one over n minus one, which I want to show converges to zero now, I'm going to write xn. So let xn equal n to the one over n minus one, which we note is bigger than or equal to zero for all n.

00:13:45.540 --> 00:14:08.580
Okay. And so my goal, I want to show, is limit as x as n goes to infinity of x sub n equals zero. All right. Because then that proves that this converges to zero. And since this is equal to its absolute value, that means that into the one over n converges to one.

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:16.440
And the way we're going to do that is using an inequality we get from the binomial theorem.

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:42.140
And, okay, so, and using kind of this trick here. Now, if we look at one plus x to the n raised to the n, this is just, let's just in.

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:53.740
Let me move it over a little bit. One plus x to the n raised to the n, x to the n, x of n is into the one over n minus one at one, I get into the one over n raised to n, I get n.

00:14:53.740 --> 00:15:16.100
Now, by the binomial theorem, this is equal to sum from k equals zero to n, n choose k. And I have one raised to the n minus k power, x to the n raised to the k.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:33.240
Now, this is a sum of non-negative things, because x sub n is always non-negative. And these coefficients are just quotients of factorial, so they're always non-negative as well.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:48.340
So, this sum is always bigger than or equal to one term from the sum. So, it's bigger than or equal to k equals two, say, y to, you'll see x of n squared.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:16:10.860
Now, n choose two, this is equal to n factorial over two factorial n minus two, factorial x to the n squared, x of n squared, which equals n times n minus one over two, x of n squared.

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:18.100
Now, I started off with n, and I proved it was bigger than or equal to this quantity here.

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:42.800
So, now I divide what's in front of the x sub n and take square roots. So, then that implies that we're all in bigger than one, because I need to divide by n minus one.

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:56.580
Zero, which is bigger than or equal to n, x sub n is less than or equal to two over n minus one, square root.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:12.020
And now this is just zero, so it converges to zero. This right-hand side is square root of two over n minus one. Now, the limit as n goes to infinity of two over n minus one is zero.

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:19.500
So, square root of that also converges to zero. That's the fact we did from the end of last time, so this whole thing converges to zero.

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:36.400
So, by the squeeze theorem, limit as n goes to infinity of x sub n, which remember this is just into the one over n minus one, which implies.

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:51.520
Okay? That completes the proof.

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:14.740
All right, so now we are going to study a couple of objects related to a bounded sequence. So, why are we going to...

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:26.640
What's the underlying question we're going to try to answer? Whenever something's introduced, you should think of it in terms of what's the question that was asked that this is trying to answer.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:38.440
So, we're now moving on to the topic of limpsoup and limmp of a sequence.

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.100
So, here's the question.

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:53.620
So, we've seen sequences that don't necessarily converge, like minus one to the n.

00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:01.600
But, and we know about sub sequences now where you just kind of pick entries along the sequence.

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:04.680
You pick one, move to the right, and pick the next one.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:23.120
Now, if you look at minus one to the n, if I just look at the sub sequence consisting of picking the odd entries, the odd numbered entries in the sequence, and I just get minus one, minus one, minus one, for my new sub sequence in this converges, it's just constant.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:30.560
Or, if I chose the even ones I'd get one, one, one, one, one, one, and that converges.

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:34.620
So, this sequence, which is bounded, has a convergent sub sequence.

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:51.720
Now, not all sequences have convergent sub sequences. For example, if you look at the sequence x sub n equals n, so x sub n is just one, two, three, four, five, six, and so on, that will not have any convergent sub sequences.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:59.100
Because any sub sequence of that has to be unbounded. That's pretty easy to show.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:04.240
And we know that a convergent sequence is bounded.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.500
So, what am I getting at?

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:14.200
So, the question that we're going to ask and try to answer is the following.

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:33.180
Does every bounded sequence have a convergent sub sequence?

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:47.060
And what I was just going on about right there is that we know this is true for, for example, for the sequence minus one to the n.

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:56.440
We also know this is true for a convergent sequence. Convergent sequences are bounded, so n they have convergent sub sequences.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:00.580
Just take the sub sequence to be the whole sequence to begin with.

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:08.140
And we have to throw in this bounded part because there are sequences that don't have any convergent sub sequences.

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:16.240
Like I just said, x sub n equals n is an example of an unbounded sequence that doesn't have any convergent sequences, sub sequences.

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:24.560
So, the answer to this question, as we'll see, is yes.

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:38.420
And this is a very, really a very powerful statement. And this is due to bosono and wirestross.

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:49.320
And I'll restate it in a little bit when we get to the statement of that theorem, namely that every bounded sequence does have a convergent sub sequence.

00:21:49.860 --> 00:22:01.000
There are several different ways to prove the theorem. We're going to prove it by introducing limb soup and limb imps because these are also two important objects that arise in analysis.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.420
So, let's get to the definition of these guys.

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:30.560
So, let x and b bounded sequence and we define

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:41.660
if they exist, there's going to be certain limits. So, it's not clear that they exist at all to begin with.

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:53.680
But we'll show that they always do exist. We define limb soup, x sub n, and sometimes n goes to infinity underneath.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:23:00.660
Sometimes I'll just write limb soup or I'll just have an n underneath it. This is supposed to be a number.

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:08.960
And this is equal to the limit as n goes to infinity of a new sequence obtained from the old sequence x sub n.

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:19.500
What are the entries of this new sequence? This is soup of x sub k, k bigger than or equal to n.

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:42.520
And the limb imp is similar except it's now with imps.

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:52.460
So, for each natural number n, I take the supremum of the set of elements x sub k for k bigger than or equal to n.

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:58.160
So, this is a bounded set because the sequence is bounded. So, this supremum is well defined, same thing for the imp.

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:01.400
So, I get a new number for each n.

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:13.220
And I take the limit of those numbers and I define one to be the limb soup, one to be the limb imp, if they exist.

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:19.320
Because, you know, limits don't always exist. So, it's not even clear that these two limits actually are meaningful.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.280
And the first thing that we'll do is we'll prove that these limits do actually always exist.

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:38.980
So, rather than keep writing this, I'm going to give these write some symbols for these two things.

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:44.720
So, let a sub n to be...

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:54.520
So, of course, if I forget to say this, at least in what I'm talking about with respect to limb soup and limb imp, I'm always talking about a bounded sequence.

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.300
But let me continue to state that as one of my hypothesis.

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:00.620
Let x sub n be a bounded sequence.

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:24.900
And let a sub n be the supremeum of the set of all elements, x, okay, where k is bigger than or equal to n.

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:34.480
And b sub n to be the infimum of x, okay, k, bigger than or equal to n.

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:36.440
Okay.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:47.720
So, then there's a couple of statements. One is...

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:56.480
That the sequence a sub n. So, remember, I take...

00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:03.120
So, let me just put over here what these things have to do with the limb soup and limb imp.

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.520
Then you can...

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:17.940
Then the limb soup of x sub n, this is defined to be the limit as n goes to infinity of the a sub n's and the limb imp of x sub n.

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:35.840
So, we need to show what we're going to show is that the limit of a sub n as n goes to infinity of a sub n exists and the limit as n goes to infinity of b sub n exists.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:39.100
So, how we're going to show that is...

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:55.280
We're going to show that a sub n is monotone decreasing and bounded.

00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:00.900
And so, these are the conclusions.

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:04.080
So, I should say...

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:14.780
Then the sequence b sub n is monotone increasing and bounded.

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:34.420
So, in particular, since we know that if we have a monotone sequence which is bounded, it has to converge.

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:47.180
That means these two limits exist.

00:27:50.400 --> 00:28:07.720
And then the second part of the theorem is kind of the simple statement that the limb imp of x sub n is less than or equal to the limb soup of x sub n.

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:17.720
Okay.

00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:33.990
So, in fact, before I prove this theorem, let me prove a small simple kind of theorem first.

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:39.010
So, let's put the proof of this theorem on whole just for a second.

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:58.210
And now, I'll prove a very simple theorem that if a and b are subsets of real numbers, a, b, both not equal to the empty set, and a is a subset of b.

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:05.590
So, also need to be bounded.

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:16.670
So, if we take two non-empty subsets of real numbers, such that b are bounded.

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:22.430
And a is a subset of b.

00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:34.130
And the conclusion is that the input b is less than or equal to the input a.

00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:41.490
And this is always less than or equal to the soup of a.

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:45.390
And this is less than or equal to the soup of b.

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:59.810
So, what this says is that if I take a subset of b, then that increases the imp and decreases the soup.

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:04.430
So, the soup of a smaller set is smaller than the soup of the bigger set.

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:06.910
And that inequality reverses for imps.

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:11.630
The imp of the smaller set is bigger than or equal to the imp of the bigger set.

00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:18.490
And this just follows immediately from the definition of soup and imps.

00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:20.470
So, I'll just prove the soup statement.

00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:42.310
So, since soup of b is an upper bound for b and a is a subset of b,

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:58.530
this implies that soup b is an upper bound for a.

00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:01.910
Soup b sits above everything in b.

00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:03.130
A is a subset of b.

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:05.030
So, it sits above everything for a.

00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:09.370
Now, the supremum of a is supposed to be the least upper bound.

00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:14.670
And therefore, if I take any upper bound for a, that has to be bigger than or equal to the soup of a.

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:23.170
So, since soup b is an upper bound for a, this implies that soup a is less than or equal to soup b.

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:24.510
And similarly, with the imps.

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:25.270
So, I'm not going to write.

00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:37.830
So, similar for imps.

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:53.570
Okay, so let's go back to the proof of the theorem here that if I have a bounded sequence,

00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:55.630
then the limb soup and the limb imp exist.

00:31:56.410 --> 00:32:03.690
And we show that by proving that these two sequences have these monotonicity properties.

00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:12.650
So, proof now of the theorem we were started off proving.

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.870
Okay.

00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:35.410
So, since the set of xk's with k bigger than or equal to n plus 1 is a subset of xk's for k bigger than or equal to n.

00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:39.470
Right, because now I have a set where k's starting at n plus 1.

00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:42.090
Here's the set with k starting at n.

00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:43.910
So, this is clearly contained in here.

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:53.170
This implies that a sub n plus 1, which is the soup of the left hand side,

00:32:57.990 --> 00:33:05.430
by this little theorem that I stated here, is less than or equal to the soup of the bigger set.

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:09.810
And this is just a sub n.

00:33:12.910 --> 00:33:19.350
So, we've proven for all n a sub n plus 1 is less than or equal to a sub n.

00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:26.610
Okay. And therefore, this sequence is monotone decreasing.

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:31.330
Okay.

00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:40.850
And so, this uses the soup part of this previous theorem.

00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:44.970
But if we use the imp part, then we also get the statement for the b sub n.

00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:54.610
So, rather than write out the details, I'll leave it to you just to flip around the inequalities for the imp in your notes.

00:33:55.150 --> 00:34:00.530
So, similarly, we're all in a natural number.

00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:12.510
B sub n is bigger than or equal to b sub n plus 1, or other way.

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:24.870
Okay. Now, so that shows these two sequences are monotone.

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:30.910
Now, we show they're bounded. This follows simply from the fact that the exavins are bounded.

00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:40.470
Since there exists a b bigger than or equal to 0 such that all n, natural numbers,

00:34:43.150 --> 00:34:47.330
exavin in absolute value is less than or equal to b, which is the same as saying b is,

00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:52.270
exavin is bounded between minus b and capital B.

00:34:55.410 --> 00:35:05.890
So, taken as elements of each of these sets, if you like, this ex of k, k, k,

00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:10.450
bigger than or equal to n, that means minus b is always a lower bound for these sets.

00:35:10.450 --> 00:35:13.330
And b is always an upper bound for these sets.

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:26.250
So, this implies that minus b is always less than or equal to ex of k, k, bigger than or equal to n.

00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:34.250
And this always sits below the supremum.

00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:43.530
And the supremum, since all of these are bounded above by b, the supremum has to be less than or equal to b.

00:35:46.690 --> 00:35:54.450
Which I'll state in terms of the a sub n's and b sub n's means minus b is less than or equal to b sub n is less than or equal to b.

00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:59.130
So, these sequences are bounded.

00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:09.070
So, in fact, these two implies that.

00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:22.910
So, we've shown that these two sequences that define, that we used to define the limb soup and the limb imp,

00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:34.590
are monotone and bounded. So, therefore, the limit of these two sequences, the limits, which define the limb soup and limb imp, actually exists.

00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:38.030
So, limb soup and limb imp is always a well-defined object.

00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:44.970
Now, this proves one to prove two. This follows immediately from what we've proven right here.

00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:55.510
So, by this part, we have b sub n is less than or equal to a sub n.

00:36:56.050 --> 00:37:00.170
So, for all n, I have these two sequences, one sitting below the other.

00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:05.070
And last time, we proved that taking the limit respects inequality.

00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:17.850
So, the limit as n goes to infinity of b sub n, which is the limb imp sits below the limit as n goes to infinity of a sub n, which is the limb soup.

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:20.730
And that completes the proof.

00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:38.030
So, I've shown that these two objects we define, the limb soup and the limb imp, exist and are well defined for every bounded sequence.

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:44.270
So, this is kind of, can be a little bit of a daunting.

00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:52.650
A couple of objects to come across when you, especially in your first analysis class.

00:37:53.390 --> 00:38:04.050
So, the best thing to do is look at examples. Whenever you come across something that you just don't quite understand, start writing down some actual things.

00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:12.550
So, for example, let's, again, look at our favorite example of a bounded sequence, which does not converge.

00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:18.750
X of n equals minus 1 to the n.

00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:36.090
Okay? Then, if I am looking at this set, X of n, n bigger than or equal to k, writing a set of X of n.

00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:44.650
Now, let me just write what it is minus 1 to the n. So, what is this set? This is just a set consisting of two elements, 1 and minus 1.

00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:57.650
So, yeah. And therefore, the soup of this set, which is the soup of this set, is just 1.

00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:26.370
Oops. So, if I take, which implies that the limp soup of minus 1 to the n, which is the limit as n goes to infinity of soup.

00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:38.290
Minus 1 to the n, and bigger than or equal to the k. As we just saw, this is just a soup of this set consisting of two elements, 1 and minus 1.

00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:46.830
This is equal to the limit as n goes to infinity of 1, equals 1. So, the limp soup of minus 1 to the n is 1.

00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:56.390
Now, if I change all these soups to n, then the n of this set is going to be the n of this set, which is just minus 1.

00:39:56.390 --> 00:40:15.930
And therefore, we also get, okay. So, the limp soup is 1. The limp is minus 1 for this set.

00:40:15.930 --> 00:40:21.930
That's supposed to be a squiggly line, not necessarily looking like a sigma.

00:40:24.810 --> 00:40:37.410
Okay. So, there's one sequence. Now, how about our next favorite sequence? X of n equals 1 over n.

00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:48.630
So, the set of elements 1 over n such that n is bigger than or equal. So, 1 over k, I should write.

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:58.190
Oh, so I was using some, this should have been a k. I'm going to make that mistake throughout.

00:40:58.950 --> 00:41:03.290
No, I kept writing X of k. So, that should be X of k.

00:41:10.530 --> 00:41:14.550
Okay. All of that is written correctly. This should have been minus 1 to the k.

00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:31.790
Okay. When it's 1 to the k. All right, very good. So, we're looking at now the set 1 over k, where n is bigger than or equal to n.

00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:49.290
So, this is just the set 1 over n, 1 over n plus 1, 1 over n plus 2, 1 over n plus 3, and so on.

00:41:50.830 --> 00:42:10.950
Okay. So, as I move to next, the next entry things are getting smaller and smaller. And, in fact, this sequence just here, now written as thinking of this as a new, so this is not a sequence, this is a set.

00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:24.830
But, taking entries to be these guys, it's easy to see that that converges to zero. So, anyways, let's say I take the supremum of this set, which is what I need to compute the limb soup.

00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:35.390
So, I'm now taking the supremum of this set, 1 over n plus 1, that's always smaller than 1 over n, and so is 1 over n plus 2, and so on and so on.

00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:52.250
And, 1 over n is an element of the set that's bigger than or equal to everything else in the set, and I think there's an exercise in the homework that asks you to show that if you have a set that contains an element, which is an upper bound for the set, then that has to be the supremum.

00:42:52.370 --> 00:43:03.710
So, the supremum of this set is simply 1 over n. Okay. So, this supremum is equal to 1 over n.

00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:27.930
So, as n goes to infinity, the limit of this supremum here, which equals the limit as n goes to infinity of 1 over n equals 0.

00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:36.810
Okay, so, the limb soup, 1 over n equals 0.

00:43:43.530 --> 00:43:50.370
Okay. But now, let's say I look at imps of this set. So, I had to take soups to look at the limb soup. Now, let's say I take imps.

00:43:50.370 --> 00:44:08.670
Okay. Now, the imp of this set, these are elements that are getting closer and closer and closer to 0. So, there's 0 over n, and then they just keep getting smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller, converging to 0.

00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:21.510
So, and you can, in fact, prove this rigorously if you like, but I think it's easy to at least convince yourself that the infimum of this set is equal to 0.

00:44:22.090 --> 00:44:37.150
Okay. The smallest thing. So, first off, 0 is a lower bound for this set. And if I take anything bigger than 0, that thing cannot be an upper bound simply because of,

00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:46.690
if you like, the Archimedean property, I can always find something from the set less than that real positive, real number. So, 0 must be the least upper bound.

00:44:51.930 --> 00:45:05.810
So, in summary, the limb imp of 1 over n, which is the imp, the limit as n goes to infinity of the imp of this set, is just the limit as n goes to infinity of 0, which equals 0.

00:45:08.070 --> 00:45:12.990
So, the limb soup of 1 over n equals 0, the limb imp equals 0 as well.

00:45:19.890 --> 00:45:20.330
Okay.

00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:43.370
So, let's take a look at these two examples a little bit and let me just make a few remarks.

00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:55.630
First off, what's to notice about this sequence is the fact that the limb soup is 1, limb imp is equal to minus 1.

00:45:56.210 --> 00:46:05.330
So, the limb soup does not equal to the limb imp. However, in this example, the limb soup, which is 0, equals the limb imp, which is 0.

00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:16.770
Now, what's the difference between these two sequences? What's the property that one holds, but the one has what the other doesn't? This is a convergent sequence, and this one is not.

00:46:18.830 --> 00:46:31.290
So, and we'll see, this is a general fact that if we have a convergent sequence in the limb soup, in the limb imp, equal each other, and are equal to the limit of the original sequence, because this sequence converges to 0.

00:46:33.130 --> 00:46:44.490
But that's not just the one-way street, it's a two-way street that in fact will prove if the limb soup equals the limb imp, then the original sequence converges.

00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:50.230
Okay. So, the sequence converges if and only if the limb soup equals the limb imp.

00:46:51.210 --> 00:47:02.950
And we saw here that kind of that in on display, that the limb soup and the limb imp don't equal each other, and the original sequence, which we know, or shown last time, doesn't converge.

00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:27.070
Right? And so, one other thing I'd like to point out is that, so the limb soup of this guy is 1, the limb imp of this guy is a minus 1, and now we can also find a sub-sequence which converges to 1, which is the limb soup. Right?

00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:39.250
We just take the entries that we choose to be the even numbered entries, and that just produces a sequence 1, and that sequence converges to 1.

00:47:39.770 --> 00:47:45.390
If we take the odd entries of the sequence, that sub-sequence is just minus 1 and converges to minus 1, which is the limb imp.

00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:53.690
And that's also a general fact we'll prove that for any bounded sequence, there exists sub-sequences converging to the limb soup, and the limb imp.

00:47:53.690 --> 00:47:57.730
And that will give us the proof of this boson of wire straws theorem.

00:48:01.070 --> 00:48:05.330
All right? And I think that's all of the remarks I want to say.

00:48:07.970 --> 00:48:09.970
And let me make one other important comment.

00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:23.390
So, this sequence, which we use to define the limb soup, and also the limb imp, in these, in three out of these four cases, they were actual sub-sequences.

00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:31.470
So, the soup of this set equals 1, which I can consider as a sub-sequence of the original guy. Right? And the same thing for the limb imp.

00:48:32.110 --> 00:48:39.110
The limb, the imp of this set, was minus 1, which I can consider as a sub-sequence of minus 1 to the n.

00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:48.470
And for the soup of this set, I got 1 over n, which I can, this is just equal to the original sequence.

00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:53.570
So, it's set, definitely, I can consider it as a sub-sequence of the original sequence.

00:48:54.150 --> 00:49:01.450
But if I take the infimum of this set, which I need to define the limb imp, I got 0 for every imp.

00:49:01.450 --> 00:49:04.630
So, I got 0 for every entry, which is not a sub-sequence of this original sequence.

00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:17.970
So, all of that is to say that the sequences I get through this process to define the limb soup and limb imp are not necessarily sub-sequences of the original sequence.

00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:27.890
So, that, what I just said a minute ago about there actually being sub-sequences, which do converge to the limb soup and limb imp.

00:49:27.890 --> 00:49:31.110
This is a non-trivial fact, which we're going to prove.

00:49:37.770 --> 00:49:38.010
Okay.

00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:51.090
So, theorem, and this will give us a boson of airstross, essentially immediately right after it.

00:49:52.670 --> 00:49:58.290
Let xn be a down the sequence.

00:50:03.630 --> 00:50:16.530
Then there exists sub-sequences, xn sub k and xm sub k.

00:50:16.530 --> 00:50:31.710
So, they don't necessarily have to be the same sub-sequence, such that limit as k goes to infinity of x sub n sub k equals the limb soup.

00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:41.130
So, it's a convergent sub-sequence and the limit as k goes to infinity of xm sub k produces the limb imp.

00:50:41.130 --> 00:50:50.130
Okay.

00:50:56.120 --> 00:51:06.740
So, this immediately gives the boson of airstross theorem, which is that every bounded sequence

00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:20.040
has a convergent sub-sequence.

00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:28.040
Okay.

00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:43.240
So, again, this follows immediately from the previous theorem, because if I take a bounded sequence, by the previous theorem I can find a sub-sequence, which converges to the limb soup, which always exists for a bounded sequence.

00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:55.280
Okay. And then that's the statement. In fact, we have something stronger in that we have at least two sub-sequences, which converge to these two numbers, which may or may not be the same.

00:51:55.280 --> 00:52:05.280
Okay.

00:52:12.130 --> 00:52:24.170
So, powerful and so strong is that it to sort of get your hands on something, it doesn't require you to show something as strong as showing there is a sequence converging to that.

00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:39.390
So, quite often, you know, you can think in terms of variational problems where you want to show that a minimum of something always exists or a maximum of something always exists.

00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:57.570
Well, what you can try and do is, you know, take a sequence of guys that you stick into your, so this is a general nonsense, that you stick into your machine or function that spits out output, and these outputs are approaching the maximum or approaching the minimum.

00:52:58.370 --> 00:53:14.490
And what you'd like to say is that there does in fact exist an element that you can stick into your machine and produce the maximum amount of output. Now, you know, maybe, you know, it's not clear how to do that.

00:53:15.490 --> 00:53:30.270
So, first take a sequence approaching so that the values are approaching that the outputs are approaching the maximum. Maybe you could show that the inputs converge to something, but that's typically really hard.

00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:51.050
But you don't have to work that hard is what the steering says, it says that what you really need to do and which is much more straightforward or simpler or possible really is to show that that sequence of inputs that you put into your machine to get the outputs is a bounded sequence.

00:53:52.170 --> 00:54:12.690
Then you could pass to a subsequence, which actually does converge to something by this theorem and proceed in that way by showing that you do have some minimum or maximum some input that produces a maximum output or minimum output.

00:54:14.490 --> 00:54:32.350
So, that's a bit, a small bit of rambling about why this theorem is so useful is that again, it's to get your hands on something that typically you want to study, it's very difficult to show convergence to that thing you want to study.

00:54:33.010 --> 00:54:53.930
Or that that thing exists because there's a sequence that you come up with at hawk actually converges to that thing. But this theorem says you don't need to work that hard or try to do the impossible and typically it's much easier just to proceed by showing your sequence of inputs is bounded.

00:54:53.930 --> 00:55:07.550
So, that's enough of that bit of rambling about why this theorem is so useful. It's also useful in the study of PDE which is what I study.

00:55:07.930 --> 00:55:14.290
So, I have a sauce spot for it, actually one of its generalizations.

00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:23.250
All right, so let's prove the theorem that there exists subsequences which converge to the limb super limb.

00:55:24.450 --> 00:55:33.950
So, as before, I'm going to use rather than keep writing the supremum of this set and I'm not going to actually I'm not even going to do this statement.

00:55:33.950 --> 00:55:42.070
I'm going to leave this as an exercise. I'm going to do this statement. I'm going to use this notation asabin as before.

00:55:44.630 --> 00:56:00.170
Asabin be soup of x sub k's bigger than or equal to n. So, I want to show that there's something converging to the limit as n goes to infinity of the asabins.

00:56:00.170 --> 00:56:14.290
So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to trap a subsequence of elements between asabin and asabin minus something which is converging to zero and not quite asabins.

00:56:14.290 --> 00:56:26.510
It will be along a subsequence as well. So, we know that there exists an in sub one bigger than or equal to one.

00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:41.270
Simply by how this is defined as a supremum and by the exercise from assignment three that there exists an in sub one bigger than or equal to one such that

00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:54.410
asabin minus one is less than or equal to less than x sub one is less than or equal to asabin.

00:57:00.110 --> 00:57:11.410
That's a sub one minus one is not an upper bound for the set asabin which is x sub k's for k's bigger than or equal to one.

00:57:12.610 --> 00:57:20.870
Therefore, I should be able to find an element from this set strictly bigger than that and of course it's always less than or equal to the supremum which is asabin.

00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:53.190
So, now since asabin sub one plus one so asabin sub one plus one not one plus one since this thing equals the supremum of x sub k such as k is bigger than or equal to n sub one plus one.

00:57:56.010 --> 00:58:23.170
There exists an a sub in sub two at least there exists an in sub two bigger than in sub one in fact it has to be bigger than or equal to in sub one plus one such that asabin plus one minus half is less than a sub in sub two.

00:58:24.550 --> 00:58:28.110
is less than or equal to a sub in plus one.

00:58:31.890 --> 00:58:44.930
So, why the in sub one plus one is because I wanted to obtain a new entry from the sequence that comes from farther than the index in sub one.

00:58:44.930 --> 00:58:51.730
I'm trying to build a sub sequence and like I said the idea is I want to somehow sandwich this should be x sub n.

00:58:53.170 --> 00:59:02.110
I want to build up a sub sequence which is sandwiched between things converging to the limb soup and use the squeeze theorem.

00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:03.990
Alright.

00:59:08.810 --> 00:59:24.410
Okay so since this is the supremum of this set that and because this thing is not an upper bound for this set there exists something from this set so some element k bigger than or equal to in sub one plus one which I'm going to call in sub two.

00:59:24.410 --> 00:59:32.110
So, that x sub in sub two is bigger than a sub in plus one and a sub in sub one plus one.

00:59:33.830 --> 00:59:52.090
And then I just keep doing this since a sub two plus one equals the supremum of the x of k such that k is bigger than or equal to in sub two plus one.

00:59:52.090 --> 01:00:13.850
So, there exists in sub three bigger than in sub two such that a sub in sub two plus one minus now a third is less than x sub in sub three is less than or equal to a sub in sub two plus one.

01:00:23.810 --> 01:00:24.670
Okay.

01:00:31.530 --> 01:00:36.810
But now we're essentially home free. We'll just continue in this manner.

01:00:37.810 --> 01:00:41.670
So, let me write down.

01:00:42.730 --> 01:01:02.330
Now strictly speaking I need to state the construction of this sequence as an inductive argument but the purposes of this class I'm not going to do that.

01:01:02.330 --> 01:01:17.130
I'm just going to say continuing in this manner and that will be what I say for this part.

01:01:17.130 --> 01:01:40.250
So, continuing in this manner we obtain a sequence of integers, natural numbers.

01:01:42.450 --> 01:02:04.330
In sub one less than in sub two less than in sub three so on such that what holds such that for all k a natural number a sub in sub k

01:02:07.790 --> 01:02:28.070
minus one plus one minus one over k is less than or equal to x in sub k less than or equal to a sub in sub k minus one plus one.

01:02:32.330 --> 01:02:37.290
Okay. And here if you like we didn't define what in sub zero is.

01:02:37.290 --> 01:02:52.250
So, really we're only interested in the ins of one in sub two.

01:02:52.250 --> 01:03:00.810
So, but for the sake of this whole thing making sense for all integers k with ins of zero being defined to be zero.

01:03:00.810 --> 01:03:06.270
Okay. That's just the first case that we dealt with.

01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:25.250
So, we obtain this sub sequence x of n sub k that sandwiched in between this sub sequence of a's and minus one over k and this sub sequence of a's of n sub k minus one.

01:03:29.030 --> 01:03:51.370
So, since ins of one is less than in sub two and so on this implies that in sub one is less than two plus one is less than three plus one.

01:03:51.370 --> 01:04:15.370
So, this is a sub sequence a sub in sub k minus one plus one is a sub sequence of a's of n's.

01:04:15.370 --> 01:04:19.710
Now, what do we know? We know the a's of n's converge to the limb soup. Right?

01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:26.610
And we proved last time that every sub sequence of a convergent sequence converges to the same thing.

01:04:31.390 --> 01:04:45.930
Thus, the limit as k goes to infinity of a's of n sub k minus one plus one equals the limit of the original sequence, which is by definition the limb soup.

01:04:48.310 --> 01:05:13.050
Okay. So, now I have this sub sequence of x's sandwiched in between two sequences, this guy on the left, this guy on the right, this guy on the right converges to the limb soup, this guy on the left converges to the limb soup minus zero because one over k converges to zero.

01:05:17.050 --> 01:05:34.850
So, by the squeeze theorem, we get that the limit as k goes to infinity of x of n sub k equals the limit as k goes to infinity of this and this whole thing, which is the limb soup.

01:05:41.590 --> 01:05:48.370
Okay. And again, so I'll leave it to you to do the limb imp part.

01:05:50.370 --> 01:06:01.170
But the point is that now, basically, this one over k gets moved over here and this becomes an a sub n sub k minus one plus one over k.

01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:11.630
And now I just have this on sitting below this guy. All right. This is really the only change for the imps to get a sub sequence converging to the limb imp.

01:06:14.310 --> 01:06:31.570
Okay. Now, we've shown that there exists a sub sequence converging to the limb soup and the limb imp, which gives us the boson of wire thrust down.

01:06:36.310 --> 01:06:47.830
And now, let me come back to the statement I made about these two sequences here, namely that the limb soup equals the limb imp if and only if the original sequence converges.

01:06:48.830 --> 01:06:50.570
So, let's prove that now.

01:06:59.070 --> 01:07:04.870
Let x of n be bounded sequence.

01:07:09.270 --> 01:07:20.550
Then x and converges. If and only if the limb soup is bounded, then the whole thing is bounded.

01:07:20.550 --> 01:07:21.590
And then x equals the limb imp.

01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:43.910
And there's one more part. Moreover, if x and converges, then all these limits agree equals the limb soup equals the limit.

01:07:47.830 --> 01:07:48.270
Okay.

01:07:53.550 --> 01:08:05.830
So, the sequence converges if and only if the limb soup equals the limb imp. And in that case that we do have this, this limit of the sequence is given by this common value of the limb soup and limb imp.

01:08:09.430 --> 01:08:12.070
Okay.

01:08:14.530 --> 01:08:21.470
Okay. So, let's go in one direction.

01:08:22.970 --> 01:08:38.910
To do this direction, we'll use a squeeze theorem. So, suppose l equals limb soup x of n equals the limb imp of x of n.

01:08:38.910 --> 01:08:48.350
So, here we're assuming that these two things equal each other. They're given by a common value l. And what we're going to end up showing is that this sequence converges to l.

01:08:48.590 --> 01:09:00.790
So, that actually gives the second part of the statement of the theorem here. So, suppose l is this common limb soup and limb imp.

01:09:04.590 --> 01:09:14.090
And then for all in a natural number, we have that the imp of the x of k's, which is for k bigger than or equal to n.

01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:29.230
So, x of n is in this set. So, it's certainly bigger than or equal to this imp and it's less than or equal to the soup of that set.

01:09:29.230 --> 01:09:43.390
Again, because x of n sits in this set. But as n goes to infinity, this sequence of numbers converges to the limb imp, which is l.

01:09:48.930 --> 01:09:54.930
So, by the squeeze theorem, the thing in between which is x of n converges to l.

01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:34.550
So, for the second part, it follows from what we've proven, what we've proved to obtain the boson of yorstras. And what we know about convergent sequences and their subsequences.

01:10:36.230 --> 01:10:43.470
So, this is where this direction, namely that convergence implies the limb soup equals the limb imp.

01:10:48.870 --> 01:11:02.130
So, let l be the limit as n goes to infinity of x of n. So, now we're assuming that the sequence converges to something which we call l, then have to be the same l from it's not going to be.

01:11:03.990 --> 01:11:14.850
So, it's just l I'm just using for this limit by previous theorem.

01:11:17.310 --> 01:11:37.170
There exists a subsequence, x of n sub k such that the limit as k goes to infinity of x of n sub k gives me l' soup of x of n.

01:11:42.150 --> 01:11:52.590
But this is a subsequence of a convergent sequence. And a subsequence of a convergent sequence is convergent and converges to the same thing.

01:11:52.590 --> 01:11:55.810
So, this thing on the left is just equal to l.

01:12:10.510 --> 01:12:25.790
Similarly, there exists a subsequence, x of n sub k such that the limit as k goes to infinity of x of n sub k equals l.

01:12:28.410 --> 01:12:37.730
So, this is a subsequence of a convergent sequence. So, it's convergent and converges to the same thing l.

01:12:37.730 --> 01:12:54.910
So, that implies that this thing is equal to l. And therefore, the limpsouple and the limpsouple and the limpsouple and they also equal the limit of the original sequence.

01:12:54.910 --> 01:13:13.070
So, that is the end of the proof of this theorem that the limpsouple and limpsouple and limpsouple when they coincide and tell you that the original sequence converges.

01:13:13.070 --> 01:13:21.470
So, that's another way of thinking about limpsouples and limps is that they also somehow measure just how divergent your sequence is.

01:13:22.570 --> 01:13:27.810
Or at least the difference between them. If that difference is zero, then the original sequence is convergent.

01:13:27.810 --> 01:13:34.170
Okay? All right. So, I think we'll stop there.
