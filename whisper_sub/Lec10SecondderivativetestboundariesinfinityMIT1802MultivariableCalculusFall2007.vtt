00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.260
So today we are going to continue

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.240
looking at critical points.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.340
And we'll learn how to actually decide

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.560
whether a critical point is a minimum or a maximum

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.480
or a settled point.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.360
So that's the main topic for today.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:46.540
So remember yesterday we looked at critical points

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.220
of functions of several variables.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.360
And so a critical point of a function

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.840
is a of two variables x and y.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.900
That's the point where the partial derivatives are both zero.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.900
And we've seen that there's various kinds of critical points.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.540
There's local minima.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.460
So maybe I should show the function and its contour plot.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.860
There's local maxima, which are like that,

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.520
and there's settled points, which are

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.580
neither minimum nor maximum.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.400
And of course, if you have a real function,

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.340
then it will be more complicated.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.900
It will have several critical points.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.880
So this example here, well, you see on the plot

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.540
that there's two maxima.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.620
And there's in the middle between them,

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.740
there's a settle point.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.760
And actually you can see them on the contour plot.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.220
On the contour plot, you see the maxima

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.800
because the level curves become circles that now down

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.620
and shrink to the maximum.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.720
And you can see the settle point,

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.280
because here you have this level curve that makes a figure 8.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.580
It crosses itself.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.880
And if you move up or down here, then,

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.880
so along the y direction, the values of the function

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.220
will decrease along the x direction,

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.320
the values will increase.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.500
So you can see, usually quite easily,

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.720
where are the critical points just

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.320
by looking either at the graph or at the contour plot?

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.940
So the only thing with the contour plot

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.180
is you need to read the values to tell a minimum

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.580
from the maximum, because the contour plots look the same,

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.060
just, of course, in one case, the values increase

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.980
and if I want to decrease.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:15.880
The question is, how do we decide between the various possibilities?

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:25.940
So local minimum, local maximum, or settle point?

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.220
So and in fact, why do we care?

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:54.000
Well, the other question is, how do we find the global minimum

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.680
or maximum of the function?

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.220
So here already I should point out, well,

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.240
first of all, to decide where the function is the largest,

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.560
in general, you'll have actually to compare the values.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.040
For example, here, if you want to know what is the maximum

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.720
of this function, well, we have two obvious candidates,

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.580
we have this local maximum and that local maximum.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.880
And the question is, which one is the higher of the two?

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.200
Well, in this case, actually, they're exactly tied for maximum.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.800
But in general, you would have to compute the function

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.180
at both points and compare the values,

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.640
if you know that it's free at one of them

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.280
and forward the other, well, four wins.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.560
The other thing that you see here is,

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.000
if you're looking for the minimum of this function,

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.260
well, the minimum is not going to be at any of the critical points.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.400
So where's the minimum?

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.560
Well, it looks like the minimum is actually out there

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.500
on the boundary or at infinity.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.360
So that's another feature of the global minimum or maximum

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.420
doesn't have to be at a critical point.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.480
It could also be somehow on the side, you know,

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.280
in some limiting situation where one variable stops

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.180
being in the allowed range of values

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.100
or goes to infinity.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.280
So we have to actually check the boundary

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.880
and the infinity behavior of our function

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.360
to know where actually the minimum and maximum will be.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.720
So in general, should point out,

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.980
these could occur either at a critical point,

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.980
or on the boundary or at infinity.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.980
So by that I mean on the boundary

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.760
of a domain of definition that we are considering.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.740
And so we have to try both.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.620
Okay, but so we'll get back to that.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.980
For now, let's try to focus on the question of,

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.140
what's the type of the critical point?

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.500
So we'll use something that's known as the second derivative test.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.700
And in principle, well, the idea is kind of similar

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.220
to what you do with a function of one variable,

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.700
namely, a function of one variable,

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.680
if the derivative is zero, then you know that you should look

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.500
at the second derivative.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.560
And that will tell you whether it's curving up or down,

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.240
whether you have a local max and a local min.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.840
And the main problem here is, of course,

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.720
we have more possible situations and we have several derivatives.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.080
So actually we have to think a bit harder about how we'll decide.

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.020
But it will again involve the second derivatives.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.440
Okay, so let's start with just an easy example

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:04.240
that will be useful to us because actually it will provide the basis

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.520
for the general method.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:14.700
Okay, so we're first going to consider a case where we have a function

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.000
that's actually just quadratic.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.260
So let's say I have a function w of xy,

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:25.280
but so the form a x squared plus bxy plus cy squared.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.460
Okay, so this guy has a critical point at the origin,

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.300
right, because if you take the derivative with respect to x,

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.640
well, and if you plug x equals y equals zero,

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:39.300
you'll get zero.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.360
And same with respect to y.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.000
You can also see if you try to do a linear approximation of this,

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.160
well, all of these guys are much smaller than x and y

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.300
when x and y are small.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.600
So the linear approximation, the tangent plane to the graph

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.460
is really just w equals zero.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.900
Okay, so how do we do it?

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:03.060
Well, yesterday, we actually did an example.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.520
It was a bit more complicated than that, but let me do it.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:15.560
So remember, we were looking at something that started with x squared plus 2xy plus 3y squared.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.180
And there were other terms, but let's forget them now.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:27.320
And what we did is we said, well, we can rewrite this as x plus y squared plus 2y squared.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.560
And now this is a sum of two squares.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.680
So each of these guys has to be non-negative,

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:37.220
and so the origin will be a minimum.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:44.080
Well, turns out we can do something similar in general,

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.960
no matter what these values of A, B, and C are.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.480
We'll just try to first complete things to a square.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:51.220
Okay, so let's do that.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:59.780
So in general, well, let me be slightly less general,

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.680
and let me assume that A is non-zero,

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.760
because otherwise I can't do what I'm going to do.

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:16.940
So I'm going to write this as A times x squared plus 2y squared.

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:21.580
So if I want to be over A xy, then I have my Cy squared.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:27.200
And now this looks like the beginning of the square of something.

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:30.380
Just like what we did over there.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.960
So what is at the square of?

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.560
Well, you'd start with x plus,

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.980
and claim if I put B over 2a times y,

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:47.060
and I square, then see the term,

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:50.200
the cross term, 2 times x times B over 2a,

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.520
y will become B over A xy.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:59.280
Of course, now I also get some y-squares out of this.

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:00.480
How many y-squares do I get?

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:05.000
Well, I get B squared over 4a squared times A,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.760
so I get B squared over 4a y squared.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:12.400
And I want, in fact, C times y squared.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:20.380
So the number of y squared that I should add is C minus B squared over 4a.

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:23.180
Okay, let's see that again.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:32.840
If I expand this thing, I will get A x squared plus A times B over 2a times 2xy,

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:40.200
that's going to be my B xy, but I also get B squared over 4a squared y squared times A,

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.680
that's B squared over 4a y squared.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.480
And that cancels out with this guy here,

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.960
and then I will be left with C y squared.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.640
Okay, do you see it?

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:59.000
Okay, if not, well, try expanding this square again.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:09.500
Okay, maybe I'll do it just to convince you, but so if I expand this,

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:15.000
I will get A times, let me put that in a different color,

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:19.380
because you wouldn't write that down, it's just to convince you again.

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:24.920
So if you don't see it yet, let's expand this thing.

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:34.100
So if I expand this thing, I will get A times x squared plus A times 2xB over 2aY,

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:43.060
well, the 2a's cancels out, we get B xy plus A times the square of that,

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:54.900
that's going to be B squared over 4a squared y squared plus C y squared minus B squared over 4aY squared.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:04.580
Here, the A and the A simplifies, and now these two terms simplify and give me

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:07.500
just C y squared in the end.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.200
Okay, and that's kind of unredeble after I've canceled everything,

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:18.860
but if you follow it, you see that basically I've just reverted my initial function.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.920
Okay, is that kind of okay?

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:30.700
I mean, otherwise there's just no substitute to, you know, you'll have to do it yourself, I'm afraid.

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:38.280
Okay, so let me continue to play with this.

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:47.260
So I'm just going to put this in a slightly different form, just to clear the denominators.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:56.880
Okay, so I will instead write this as 1 over 4a times the big thing.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:07.260
So I'm going to just put 4a squared times x plus B over 2aY squared.

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:10.340
Okay, so so far I have the same thing as here.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.840
Okay, I just introduced 4a that cancels out.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:20.080
Plus for the other one, I'm just clearing the denominator.

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:24.620
I end up with 4aC minus B squared y squared.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.560
Okay, so that's a lot of terms.

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:32.200
But what does it look like?

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:36.700
Well, it looks like, so we have some constant factors, and here we have a square,

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:38.960
and here we have a squared, a square.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.580
So basically we've written this as a sum of two squares.

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.620
Well, a sum or a difference of two squares.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.460
And maybe that's what we need to figure out to know what kind of point it is.

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:58.920
Because, see, if you take a sum of two squares, then you'll know that each square takes non-negative values,

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:03.640
and you'll have the total, you know, the function will always take non-negative values.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.500
So the origin will be a minimum.

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:10.920
Well, if you have a difference of two squares, then typically you'll have a saddle point

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:16.800
because depending on whether one of the other is larger, you'll have a positive or a negative quantity.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:24.280
Okay, so I claim there's various cases to look at.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.360
So let's see.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:37.500
So in fact I claim there will be three cases, and that's good news for us because after all,

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:39.380
we want to distinguish between three possibilities.

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:46.120
So let's first do away with the most complicated one.

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:51.120
What if for a c minus b squared is negative?

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:59.440
Well, if it's negative, then it means what I have between the brackets is,

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:04.360
so the first guy is obviously a positive quantity.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:11.660
While the second one will be something negative times y squared, so it will be a negative quantity.

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:25.540
Okay, so one term is positive, v over r is negative, that tells us we actually have a saddle point.

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:34.140
We have in fact written out function as a difference of two squares.

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:38.280
Okay, is that convincing?

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:43.540
So if you want what I could do is actually I could change my coordinates,

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:50.280
have new coordinates called, I don't know, u equals x plus b over 2a y, and v,

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:55.400
actually what I could keep y, and then it would look like a difference of squares directly.

00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:00.760
Okay, so that's the first case.

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:10.240
The second case is where for a c minus b squared equals zero.

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:20.260
Well, what happens if that's zero, then it means that this term over there goes away.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.020
So what we have is just one square.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:31.860
Okay, so what that means is actually that our function depends only on one direction of things.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.640
In the other direction it's going to actually be degenerate.

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:44.320
So for example, forget all the clutter in there, say I give you just the function of two variables,

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:46.720
w equals just x squared.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:52.020
So that means it doesn't depend on y at all, and if I try to plot the graph,

00:16:54.480 --> 00:17:00.920
it will look well, so x is here, so it will depend on x in that way,

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.740
but it doesn't depend on y at all.

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:13.280
So what the graph looks like is something like that.

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:20.180
Okay, it's, basically it's a valley whose bottom is completely flat.

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:24.040
So that means actually we have a degenerate critical point.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:28.480
It's called degenerate because there's a direction in which nothing happens,

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:33.260
and in fact you have critical points everywhere along the y axis.

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:43.260
Okay, so now whether the square that we have is x or something else namely x plus b over t,

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.760
or x to a y, it doesn't matter.

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:49.880
I mean it will still get this degenerate behavior, but there's a direction in which nothing happens,

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:53.620
because we just have the square of one quantity.

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:04.380
I'm sure that 300 students means 300 different ringtones,

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.560
but I'm not eager to hear all of them.

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:07.380
Thanks.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:09.680
Okay.

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:18.380
So this is what's called the degenerate critical point.

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:22.940
And...

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:28.520
Okay.

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:32.440
So basically we leave it here.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:38.000
We won't actually try to figure out further what happens,

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:42.480
and the reason for that is that when you have an actual function,

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:45.840
a general function, not just one that's quadratic like this,

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:51.040
then there will actually be over terms, maybe involving higher powers,

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.300
maybe x cubed or y cubed or things like that.

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.780
And then there will mess up what happens in this valley,

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:01.620
and it's a situation where we won't be able actually to tell automatically

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:04.100
just by looking at second derivatives what happens.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.700
See, for example, in the function of one variable,

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:13.140
if you have just a function of one variable, say, f of x equals x to the 5,

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.000
well, if you try to decide what type of point the origin is,

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:20.440
you're going to take the second derivative, it will be 0,

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:22.020
and then you can conclude.

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:24.740
Because things depend on higher order derivatives.

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:28.580
So we just won't like that case.

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:31.960
We just won't try to figure out what's going on here.

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:38.380
Now, the last situation is if 4ac-b squared is positive.

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:44.240
So then, that means that actually,

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:48.440
with written things, the big bracket up there is a sum of two squares.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:49.960
Okay?

00:19:53.840 --> 00:20:00.960
So, that means that we've written w as one of our 4a times,

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:05.890
plus something squared, plus something else squared.

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:08.350
Okay?

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:15.030
So, these guys have the same sign, and that means that this term here will always be

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:17.890
greater or equal to 0.

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:23.890
And so, that means that we should have either a maximum or a minimum.

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:25.830
How do we decide which one it is?

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:28.390
Well, we look at the sign of a, exactly.

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:29.390
Okay?

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:31.310
So, there's two subcases.

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:39.310
One is if a is positive, then this quantity overall will always be

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:45.050
non-negative, and that means we have a minimum.

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:46.410
Okay?

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:55.950
And if a is negative on the other hand,

00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:02.330
so that means that we multiply this positive quantity by a negative number,

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:06.110
we get something that's always negative, so 0 is actually the maximum.

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:12.990
Okay?

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:15.750
Is that clear for everyone?

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:18.750
Yes?

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:31.950
So, yeah, I said in the example w equals x squared,

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:33.130
it doesn't depend on y.

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:38.950
If I have, so the marginal situation is w equals some constant,

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:45.990
well, I guess it's a times x plus b over 2a times y squared.

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:50.230
So, it does depend on x and on y, but it only depends on this combination.

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:51.410
Okay?

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:55.330
So, if I choose to move in somehow the perpendicular direction,

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:57.990
in the direction where this remains constant,

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:03.030
so maybe if I set x equals minus b over 2a,

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:06.790
y, then this remains 0 all the time.

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:11.330
So, there's a degenerate direction in which I stay at the minimum or maximum

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:12.610
or whatever it is that I have.

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:15.030
Okay? So, that's why it's called degenerate.

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:16.690
There's a direction in which nothing happens.

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:19.010
Okay?

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:22.890
Yes?

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:28.430
Are we going to take the actual derivative?

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:30.590
Yes, yeah. So, that's a very good question.

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:32.590
So, I say this is going to be the second derivative test.

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:34.170
Why do we not have the derivatives yet?

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:39.230
Well, that's because I've been looking at this special example where we have a function like this,

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:42.250
and so I don't actually need to take derivatives yet.

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:47.210
But that's secretly that's because a, b, and c will be the second derivatives of a function,

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:49.310
actually 2a, b, and 2c.

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:52.130
So, now we are going to go to a general function,

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:56.350
and there, instead of having these coefficients a, b, and c given to us,

00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:58.510
we'll have to compute them as second derivatives.

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:00.190
Okay?

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:07.630
So, here I'm basically setting the stage for what will be the actual criterion we'll use using second derivatives.

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:08.590
Yes?

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:15.410
So, yes. So, when you have a degenerate critical point,

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:19.990
it could be a degenerate minimum or a degenerate maximum depending on the sign of a.

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:25.830
But in general, once you start having more complicated functions,

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:27.650
you don't really know what will happen anymore.

00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:29.850
It could also be a degenerate saddle and so on.

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:32.010
So, we won't really be able to tell.

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:36.890
Yes?

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:42.410
It is possible to have a degenerate saddle point.

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.190


00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:46.390
For example, if I give you x cubed plus y cubed,

00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:49.530
you can convince yourself that if you take x and y to be negative,

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:52.990
it will be negative if x and y are positive, it's positive,

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:56.070
and it has a very degenerate critical point at the origin.

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:58.190
So, that's a degenerate saddle point.

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:03.930
We don't see it here because that doesn't happen if you have only quadratic terms like that.

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:06.770
You need to have higher order terms to see it happen.

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:12.330
Okay.

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:20.990
So, let's continue.

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:27.510
Oh, before we continue, let's see, I want to point out one small thing.

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:32.030
So, here we have this magic quantity for a c minus b squared.

00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:34.270
You've probably seen that before in your life.

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:40.530
Yeah, it looks like the quadratic formula except that one involves b squared minus 4 ac,

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:42.610
but that's really the same thing.

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:43.910
Okay.

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:49.570
So, let's see.

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:51.450
Where does the quadratic formula come in here?

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:59.710
Well, let me write things differently.

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:02.790
Okay. So, we've manipulated things and gotten to a conclusion.

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:06.210
But let me just do a different manipulation.

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:17.390
And write this now instead as y squared times a times x over y squared

00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:21.670
plus b x over y plus c.

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:24.890
See, that's the same thing that I had before.

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:26.450
Right?

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:33.550
Well, so now, this quantity here is always non-negative.

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:35.970
What about this one?

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:40.890
Well, of course, this one depends on x over y.

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:44.510
It depends on which direction you're going to move away from the origin,

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:47.050
which ratio between x and y you will consider.

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:50.550
But I claim there's two situations.

00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:56.350
One is, so let's try to reformulate things.

00:25:57.350 --> 00:26:01.650
So, if a discriminant here is positive, then it means that this has roots.

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:03.330
This has solutions.

00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:13.370
And that means that this quantity can be both positive and negative.

00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:24.390
This quantity takes positive and negative values.

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:31.090
One way to convince yourself is just to, you know, plot.

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:36.830
A is squared plus b t plus c.

00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:39.390
You know that there's two roots.

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:44.550
So it might look like this or it might look like that depending on the sign of a.

00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:52.190
But in either case, it will take values of both signs.

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:56.070
So that means that your function will take values of both signs.

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:07.850
The value takes both positive and negative values.

00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:16.010
And so that means we have a saddle point.

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:26.470
While the other situation, when b squared minus 4 AC is negative,

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:36.470
means that this equation, this quadratic, never takes the value zero.

00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:40.750
So it's always positive or it's always negative depending on the sign of a.

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:52.410
So the other case is if b squared minus 4 AC is negative, then that quadratic doesn't have a solution.

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:58.470
And it could look like this or like that depending on whether a is positive or a is negative.

00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:16.530
So in particular, that means a x over y squared plus b x over y plus c is always positive or always negative.

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:20.610
Depending on the sign of a.

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:25.350
And then that tells us that our function double, you will be always positive or always negative.

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:28.330
And then we'll get a minimum or a maximum.

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:43.290
We'll have a min or a max depending on which situation we're in.

00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:47.910
So that's another way to derive the same answer.

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:52.890
And now here you see why the discriminant plays a role.

00:28:53.430 --> 00:29:04.330
That's because it exactly tells you whether this quadratic quantity has always the same sign or whether it can actually cost the value zero when you have a root of a quadratic.

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:20.090
Okay, so hopefully at this stage you're happy with one of the two explanations at least.

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:32.150
And now you're willing to believe, I hope, that we have basically a way of deciding what type of critical point we have in the special case of a quadratic function.

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:57.870
Okay.

00:29:57.870 --> 00:30:03.250
Okay, so now what do we do with a general function?

00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:12.950
Well, so in general, we want to look at second derivatives.

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:24.250
Okay, so now we're getting to the real stuff.

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:27.990
So how many second derivatives do we have?

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:29.690
That's maybe the first thing we should figure out.

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:34.890
Well, we can take the derivative first with respect to x.

00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:37.850
And then again with respect to x.

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:48.950
Okay, that gives us something we denote by partial square f of our partial x squared or f sub xx.

00:30:54.490 --> 00:31:02.410
Then there's another one which is f sub xy, which means you take the derivative with respect to x.

00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:09.430
And then with respect to y, another thing you can do is do first derivative with respect to y.

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:13.790
And then with respect to x. That would be f sub yx.

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:16.290
Well, good news.

00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:19.750
These are actually always equal to each other.

00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:26.650
Okay, so it's a fact that we will admit it's really not very hard to check.

00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:29.390
So these are always the same.

00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:32.310
We don't need to worry about which one we do.

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:36.330
That's one computation that we want to do.

00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:38.330
We can save a bit of effort.

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:48.510
And then we have the last one, namely the second partial with respect to y and y, f sub yy.

00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:52.730
Okay, so we have three of them.

00:31:58.810 --> 00:32:01.930
So what does the second derivative test say?

00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:28.690
It says, say that you have a critical point, x0, y0 of a function of two variables f.

00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:33.210
And then let's compute the partial derivatives.

00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:41.690
So let's call capital A the second derivative with respect to x.

00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:47.090
Let's call capital B the second derivative with respect to x and y.

00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:53.530
And c equals f sub yy at this point.

00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:59.810
Okay, so these are just numbers because we first compute the second derivative.

00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:03.710
And then we plug in the values of x and y at the critical point.

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:05.510
So this will just be numbers.

00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:14.750
And now what we do is we look at the quantity, ac minus b squared.

00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:20.830
I am not forgetting a four.

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:23.150
You will see why there is one.

00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:30.990
So if ac minus b squared is positive, then there's two subcases.

00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:39.350
If a is positive, then it's a local minimum.

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:57.630
The second case, so still if ac minus b squared is positive, but a is negative,

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:01.250
then it's going to be a local maximum.

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:13.150
And if ac minus b squared is negative, then it's a saddle point.

00:34:15.250 --> 00:34:21.570
And finally, if ac minus b squared is zero, then we actually cannot conclude.

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:29.950
We don't know whether it's going to be a minimum, a maximum or a saddle.

00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:36.750
We know it's degenerate in some way, but we don't know what type of point it is.

00:34:38.890 --> 00:34:40.890
Okay, so that's actually what you need to remember.

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:44.410
If you're, you know, formula oriented, that's all you need to remember about today.

00:34:44.410 --> 00:34:49.530
But let's try to understand why, you know, how this comes out of what we had there.

00:34:54.730 --> 00:35:05.070
Okay, so I think maybe I actually want to keep, so maybe I want to keep this middle board

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:09.190
because it actually has, you know, the recipe that we found before for the quadratic function.

00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:15.990
So let me move directly over there and try to relate our old recipe with a new one.

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:43.990
Okay, I easily amused.

00:35:48.030 --> 00:36:00.210
Okay, so first let's check that these two things say the same thing in the special case that we were looking at.

00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:14.290
Okay, so let's verify in the special case where the function was a x squared plus bxy plus cys squared.

00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:27.130
So, well, what is the second derivative with respect to x and x?

00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:33.970
If I take the second derivative with respect to x and x, so first I want to take, maybe the derivative with respect to x,

00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:43.230
let's take first, the first partial, w sub x, that will be 2ax plus bxy.

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:53.010
Right? So, w sub xx will be, well, let's take the partial respect to x again, but 2a.

00:36:53.010 --> 00:37:00.310
Okay, w sub xy, I take the partial respect to y, I will get b.

00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:05.390
Okay, now we need also the partial respect to y.

00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:10.970
So, w sub y is bx plus 2cy.

00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:18.250
In case you don't believe what I told you about the mixed partial, w sub yx.

00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:24.570
Well, you can check, and it's again b, so they are indeed the same thing.

00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:28.950
And w sub yy will be 2c.

00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:45.010
So, if we now look at this quantities, that tells us, well, big a is 2, little a, big b is little b,

00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:57.150
big c is 2, little c. So, ac minus b squared is what we used to call 4, little ac minus b squared.

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:10.210
Okay? So, now you can compare the cases, well, they are not listed in the same order, just to make it harder.

00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:21.010
But, so we said first, if, so the subtle case is 1, ac minus b squared in big letters is negative.

00:38:21.170 --> 00:38:25.530
That's the same as 4ac minus b squared in lower case is negative.

00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:34.430
The case where capital ac minus b squared is positive, local min and local max corresponds to this one.

00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:40.490
And the case where we can't conclude was what used to be the degenerate one.

00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:47.730
Okay? So, at least we don't seem to have messed up when copying the formula.

00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:50.890
Now, why does that work more generally than that?

00:38:55.590 --> 00:39:01.250
Well, the answer to that is again Taylor approximation.

00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:15.610
Okay? So, let me just do here quadratic approximation.

00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:23.890
So, quadratic approximation tells me the following thing.

00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:36.390
It tells me if I have a function f of xy and I want to understand the change in f when I change x and y a little bit.

00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:43.230
Well, there's the first order terms, there's the linear terms, but by now you should know and be comfortable with.

00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:53.890
If that's f sub x times the change in x. Then there's f sub y times the change in y.

00:39:56.010 --> 00:40:08.110
Okay? That's the starting point. But now of course, if x and y, sorry, if we are at a critical point, then that's going to be 0 at a critical point.

00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:17.650
So, that term actually goes away. And that's also 0 at the critical point.

00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:25.250
So, that term also goes away. Okay? So linear approximation is really no good. We need more terms.

00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:34.070
So, what are the next terms? Well, the next terms are quadratic terms.

00:40:34.070 --> 00:40:48.930
And so, I mean, if you remember the Taylor formula for a function of a single variable, there was the derivative times x minus x0 plus 1 half of the second derivative times x minus x0 squared.

00:40:49.170 --> 00:40:54.490
And so, this side here is really Taylor approximation in one variable looking only at x.

00:40:54.490 --> 00:41:13.590
But of course, we also have terms involving y and terms involving simultaneously x and y. And these terms are f sub xy times change in x times change in y plus 1 half of fyy times y minus y0 squared.

00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:21.670
There's no one half in the middle because in fact, you would have two terms, one for xy, one for yx, but they are the same.

00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:30.830
And then, if you want to continue, there's actually cubic terms involving the third derivatives and so on, but we are not actually looking at them.

00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:45.570
And so, now, when we do this approximation, well, the type of critical point remains the same when we replace the function by this approximation.

00:41:46.650 --> 00:41:56.470
And so, we can apply the argument that we used to deduce things in the quadratic case. In fact, we can still work in the general case using this approximation formula.

00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:18.210
So, the general case reduces to the quadratic case.

00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:39.210
And now, you see actually why, well, here you see again how this coefficient, which we used to call little a, is also 1 half of capital A.

00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:50.530
And same here, this coefficient is what we call capital B or little B. And this coefficient here is what we called little C or 1 half of capital C.

00:42:54.390 --> 00:43:03.470
And then, when you replace things into the various cases that we had here, you end up with a second derivative test.

00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:12.030
So, what about the degenerate case? Why can't we just say, well, it's going to be a degenerate critical point?

00:43:13.330 --> 00:43:21.630
So, the reason is that this approximation formula is reasonable only if the higher order terms are negligible.

00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:31.090
So, in fact, secretly there's more terms. This is only an approximation. There would be terms involving third derivatives and maybe even beyond that.

00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:42.830
And so, in the non-degenerate case, they don't actually matter because the shape of the function, the shape of the graph is actually determined by the quadratic terms.

00:43:43.830 --> 00:44:00.010
But in the degenerate case, see if I start with this and I add something even very, very small along the y-axis, then that can be enough to bend this very slightly up or slightly down and turn my degenerate point into either a minimum or a saddle point.

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:04.690
And I won't be able to tell until I go further in the list of derivatives.

00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:19.510
So, in the degenerate case, what actually happens depends on the higher order derivatives.

00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:47.210
So, we need to analyze things more carefully while we are not going to bother with that in this class. So, we'll just say, well, we cannot conclude.

00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:58.790
I mean, you have to realize that in real life, you have to be extremely unlucky for this quantity to end up being exactly zero.

00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:09.090
Well, if that happens, then what you should do is maybe try by inspection. See, there's a good reason why the function should always be positive or always be negative or something.

00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:19.850
Or, you know, plot it on the computer and see what happens. But, otherwise, we can't conclude.

00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:35.830
Okay, so let's do an example. So, probably, we should leave this on so that we still have the test with us.

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:42.470
And instead, okay, so I'll do my example here.

00:45:49.850 --> 00:45:56.850
Okay.

00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:36.570
So, it's an example. Let's say I look at f of xy equals x plus y plus one of our xy, where x and y are positive.

00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:43.090
So, I'm looking on the first quadrant. Okay. I mean, I'm doing this because I don't want this denominator to become zero.

00:46:44.090 --> 00:46:55.950
So, I'm just looking at that situation. So, let's look first for, so the question will be what are the minimum and the maximum of this function.

00:46:57.890 --> 00:47:05.730
So, the first thing we should do to answer this question is look for critical points.

00:47:13.090 --> 00:47:16.070
So, for that, we have to compute the first derivatives.

00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:31.670
Okay. So, f sub x is one minus one of our x squared y.

00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:38.270
Okay. Take the derivative of one of our x, but negative one of our x squared.

00:47:39.450 --> 00:47:41.450
And we'll want to set that equal to zero.

00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:51.190
And f sub y is one minus one of our xy squared. And we want to set that equal to zero.

00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:55.730
So, what are the equations we have to solve?

00:47:58.650 --> 00:48:02.890
Well, I guess x squared y equals one.

00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:08.990
I mean, if I get this, you know, if I move this guy over here, I get one of our x squared y equals one.

00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:13.050
That's x squared y equals one. And xy squared equals one.

00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:16.210
What do you get by comparing these two?

00:48:18.350 --> 00:48:24.090
Well, x and y should both be, okay. So, yeah, I agree with you that one and one is a solution.

00:48:25.530 --> 00:48:29.330
So, first, if I divide this one by that one, I get x over y equals one.

00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:36.190
So, that tells me x equals y. And then if x equals y, then if I put that into here,

00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:44.010
it will give me y cubed equals one, which tells me y equals one, and therefore, x equals one as well.

00:48:46.310 --> 00:48:49.790
Okay. So, there's only one solution.

00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:56.270
There's only one critical point, which is going to be one comma one.

00:48:58.130 --> 00:49:05.490
Okay. So, now, here's where you do a bit of work.

00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:10.610
What do you think of that critical point?

00:49:16.550 --> 00:49:22.990
Okay. I see some valid votes. I see some...

00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:24.550
I see a lot of people answering for.

00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:33.230
That seems to suggest that maybe, well, you haven't computed the second derivative yet.

00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:35.830
Yes, I see someone giving the correct answer.

00:49:35.830 --> 00:49:43.190
I see more and more correct answers. Okay.

00:49:44.210 --> 00:49:50.310
So, let's see. To figure out what type of point it is, we should compute the second partial derivatives.

00:49:51.010 --> 00:49:56.630
Okay. So, f sub xx is...

00:49:57.310 --> 00:50:00.450
Well, do we get, when we take the derivative of this, with respect to x?

00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:09.290
2 over x cubed y. Okay.

00:50:10.970 --> 00:50:13.790
So, at our point, a will be 2.

00:50:16.250 --> 00:50:23.610
f sub xy will be one over x squared y squared.

00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:27.410
So, b will be one.

00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:34.490
And f sub yy is going to be one...

00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:37.750
No. 2 over xy cubed.

00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:41.670
So, c will be 2.

00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:49.250
And so, that tells us, well, ac minus b squared is four minus one.

00:50:50.650 --> 00:50:53.870
So, I should probably use a different blackboard for that.

00:51:01.330 --> 00:51:06.710
Ac minus b squared is two times two minus one squared is three is positive.

00:51:07.570 --> 00:51:11.650
But tells us we are either a local minimum or a local maximum.

00:51:13.110 --> 00:51:15.190
And a is positive.

00:51:16.450 --> 00:51:18.770
So, it's a local minimum.

00:51:19.950 --> 00:51:22.330
And in fact, we can check it's the global minimum.

00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:24.110
What about the maximum?

00:51:27.130 --> 00:51:31.030
Well, the maximum is not actually at a critical point.

00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:32.630
It's on the boundary or at infinity.

00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:38.790
See, so we have actually to check what happens when x and y go to zero or go to infinity.

00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:43.790
Well, if that happens, if x or y goes to infinity, then the function goes to infinity.

00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:48.230
Also, if x or y goes to zero, then one of the xy goes to infinity.

00:51:49.010 --> 00:52:02.410
So, the maximum, well, the function goes to infinity when x goes to infinity or y goes to infinity or x and y go to zero.

00:52:04.690 --> 00:52:06.450
So, it's not at a critical point.

00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:12.430
So, in general, we have to check both the critical points and the boundaries to decide what happens.

00:52:13.970 --> 00:52:15.930
Okay, the end. Have a nice weekend.
