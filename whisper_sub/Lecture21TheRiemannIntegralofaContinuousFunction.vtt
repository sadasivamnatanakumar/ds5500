00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:25.780
So we're going to continue our discussion of 1 and 2.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:43.340
The Riemann integral, which remember from the discussion at the end of the last lecture,

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.260
is a theory of area underneath the graph of a function.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.640
So what is that theory? The theory is built up as follows.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:05.640
Given a continuous function f, so this is just kind of a refresher on the definitions I introduced last time.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:24.500
Partition is just points between just breaking up the interval from A to B into points into little subintervals

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.140
with the norm of this partition being kind of the length of the longest subinterval.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.460
Xc, which we refer to as a tag, is just a set of points with one lying in each of these subintervals.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:55.140
So for me, let's take them all to the right end point of these intervals.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.520
And then associated to a tagged partition, which is a pair x and xc.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.960
We associated a Riemann sum, which is f evaluated at these points times the length of the interval.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:16.400
So if we draw the graph of a function f and say in this picture,

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:36.180
this number, this Riemann sum, would then be equal to the area of these three boxes here.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:48.020
And so our theory of Riemann integration or our theory of the area underneath the curve is built on the following goal,

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:56.700
which is to show that as these partitions get finer and finer as the norm of these partitions goes to zero,

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.320
these Riemann sums should converge to some number.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:10.000
And that number, which we call the Riemann integral of f, we interpret as the area underneath the graph of f.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:18.120
So the first goal, the main goal, really, to start off with is to show that this is a reasonable,

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:30.860
that this is actually true, that these Riemann sums do, in fact, converge to some number as they become finer and finer.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.360
For a given continuous function.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.420
So that is the main theorem, which I think is going to be the main thing that we prove today.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:56.420
So the theorem of the Riemann integral, which is the following,

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:07.920
let f be a continuous function from a b to R, which remember this was the notation we used from last time.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.920
Let me move my picture over here.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:39.140
Then there exists a unique real number, which we denote as the usual symbol integral a b f of x dx.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.740
With the following property.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:59.300
For every sequence of partitions,

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:21.480
this is xrcr such that the norm of these partitions is going to zero as R goes to infinity.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.860
So these partitions are getting finer and finer if the norm is going to zero.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.780
Remember the norm is the length of the longest sub-interval I have.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.680
So for all sequence of partitions with norms converging to zero,

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.380
we have that the limit of the Riemann sums exists

00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:03.020
and equals this number, which we refer to as the Riemann integral of f.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.440
So there's a lot to unpack here.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:18.140
First off, what this number integral from a b to f of x dx, this property that it has is no matter what sequence of partitions you take,

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:24.820
as long as they're becoming finer and finer, this limit actually exists, and it equals the same number.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.960
It equals this number integral a b f of x dx.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:34.960
So I could take two different sequences of partitions becoming finer and finer, look at the Riemann sums,

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:43.860
and those two sequences of Riemann sums converge and they converge to the same number, which I, again,

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.480
which we denote by integral a b f of x dx, the Riemann integral of f.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:55.940
And so it's this number, which we interpret as the area underneath the graph of f.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.860
So our main goal for today is to prove this theorem.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:21.320
So first off, there's two parts of the statement here.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.380
There exists a unique real number, which we denoted by that with this property.

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.480
Uniqueness is immediate, right?

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:40.020
If I have two real numbers such that for all sequence of partitions with norm going to zero, the limit of the Riemann sums equals that limit,

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:46.600
well, limits of sequences are unique, and therefore those two numbers have to be the same.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:57.540
So uniqueness is clear. It's really the existence part that we have to prove, that there exists a real number so that no matter what sequence of partitions we take,

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:03.000
the corresponding Riemann sums converge to zero, as long as the partitions become finer and finer.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:14.000
Okay? Okay. Now for, now we're not going to prove this theorem just yet.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:22.880
We need some facts that will be used in the proof, so we're going to put off proving this theorem for a few minutes,

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.940
and first prove some necessary facts.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:45.720
So let me first define a useful metric, or number associated to, or function associated to a continuous function called the modulus of continuity.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:09:07.000
So for f, continuous function, and eta positive, we define the modulus of continuity omega f of eta.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:20.180
This is equal to the supremum of f of x minus f of y, an absolute value, such that the absolute value of x minus y is less than or equal to eta.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:46.180
Okay? So what is this modulus of continuity measure, and measures, you know, given if I take any two points less than or equal to eta in distance, and I look at f of x minus f of y, an absolute value, and take the soup over all that, that gives me the modulus of continuity.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:10:04.460
Now for example, let's do the simplest example possible, f of x equals a x plus b, then what do we get?

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:14.500
f of x minus f of y, this is equal to a times x minus y.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:44.480
So if x minus y is less than or equal to eta, we get that f of x minus f of y, an absolute value, is less than or equal to, or I mean it's equal to a times x minus y is less than or equal to a times x minus y.

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:58.880
And therefore, absolute value of a times eta is an upper bound for this set, for this function, and it's also achieved.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:03.940
So if I take absolute value of x minus y equal to eta, then this will be equality.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:19.300
So what I'm saying is, is that for this example, for f equals a x plus b, the modulus of continuity is equal to a absolute value of a times eta.

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:35.860
Now something to note here is that for this guy right here, as eta goes to zero, the modulus of continuity goes to zero as well.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:45.820
And this is not special to this function, in fact it's true for all continuous functions.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:52.140
This is somehow, so let me state the theorem and then give you an interpretation of it.

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:54.100
So let me call this theorem one.

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:13.540
So for all f, continuous on the closed and bounded interval in a b, limit as eta goes to zero of omega f of eta equals zero.

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:39.900
Now, so make one more comment here, maybe this will also, just to connect to something we did earlier, right, which follows immediately from the definition of this guy that for all x and y,

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:48.220
this is true.

00:12:51.300 --> 00:13:02.320
And therefore, you should think of, if I'm trying to make this small, then the modulus of continuity is something that controls how close f of x and f of y are together.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:08.240
So somehow continuity is controlled by this function, the modulus of continuity, right.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:20.280
So if this goes to zero, then, I mean, if, as this goes to zero, this goes to zero, then somehow I'm saying f of x and f of y are very close together.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:29.480
So again, the modulus of continuity is a way of measuring continuity of a function.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.280
Okay, that's one way to think of it.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.700
All right, so let's prove this.

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:51.240
This is a limit statement, and what we're going to do is we'll just prove it the old fashioned way, let epsilon be positive.

00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:03.040
What do we know about functions which are continuous on a closed and bounded interval? Well, they're also uniformly continuous, right.

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:31.980
So since f is continuous on this closed and bounded interval, f is uniformly continuous, this means that there exists delta zero positive such that for all x and y.

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:46.060
x and y less than delta zero implies that f of x minus f of y is less than, we put epsilon over two, I'm going to give myself a little space here.

00:14:47.060 --> 00:15:02.860
Okay. So just to recall, what we're trying to do here in terms of the definition of what this means, we're trying to show that for all epsilon positive, there exists a delta positive such that,

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:21.620
such that for all eta, you know, eta is actually a positive number here, so implies omega f of eta is less than epsilon.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:22.820
Okay.

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:51.240
Okay. All right, so this is what we're trying to prove. We know that for continuous function, it's uniformly continuous, and therefore there exists this delta zero so that when x minus y is less than delta zero, f of x minus f of y is less than epsilon over two for all x, y in the interval.

00:15:51.780 --> 00:16:09.860
Okay. So now let me use that, so basically I'm going to choose delta to be this delta zero, the delta I need for this, and now let me show that it works.

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:35.700
So let me show that x, suppose eta is less than delta, which remember is delta zero, and if x minus y is less than eta, which again is less than, less than or equal to eta, which is less than delta zero, I get that f of x minus f of y is less than epsilon over two.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:17:04.280
Right? Basically I just rewrote what I had right there, and therefore this implies that epsilon over two is an upper bound for the set f of x minus f of y, x minus y is less than eta.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:32.180
Which implies that the supremum of this set, which is by definition, so I'm just going to put brackets here, and I hope that's clear that I'm referring to this set here when I put that here, that the supremum of this set has to be less than or equal to this upper bound, which is less than epsilon.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:49.120
So we've proven that if eta is less than delta, then the modulus of continuity of f of eta is less than epsilon, and therefore this is what we wanted to prove.

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:05.180
Okay.

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:12.500
OK.

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:27.600
All right, so that's one fact that I need,

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.860
that this modulus of continuity, which

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:33.260
remember is the supremum of the difference of f of x

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:36.600
and f of y as long as x and y are bounded by eta.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.560
That this converges to 0 as eta converges to 0

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.360
for all continuous functions.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:49.400
And this is key in showing that the Riemann integral

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.980
exists for continuous functions.

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.580
So theorem 2 is the following.

00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:02.900
So this is going to tell us kind of how two Riemann sums

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:07.740
are comparable if one partition is finer than the other.

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:32.780
So if I have two tag partitions of a b such that x prime

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:34.480
is a subset of x.

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:38.080
So this means that x prime, so this

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.600
is a partition, a breakup of a b, that

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.580
contains all the points of x and more.

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:45.900
So it's a finer partition.

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:54.460
And we refer to x prime as a refinement of the partition x.

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:05.240
So we have two partitions.

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:09.860
One is finer than the other and a continuous function f.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.820
Then we can estimate the difference in the Riemann sums.

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:26.680
This is less than or equal to the modulus of continuity of f

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:35.520
evaluated at the norm of the coarser partition times the

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.280
length of the interval.

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:56.100
So this says as long as one way to think about it is if

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:01.760
the partition x is very fine and then I take a finer

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:05.500
partition, that's not going to change the Riemann sum too much.

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:08.500
Because remember this is converging to 0 as the norm of the

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:13.120
partition, how fine it is, or you can think how coarse it is,

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:13.960
is going to 0.

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:21.780
OK, so the idea is very simple.

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:25.140
It's just going to take me a little bit just to write down.

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:38.580
So like I said, this partition being contained in the other

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:43.680
means this partition has all the points in x and then some more.

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:55.120
So we're going to break these partitions up into, or at least

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.160
points in x and then plus the extra one.

00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:59.000
So for k equals 1 to n.

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.960
So let me draw a picture first and then I'll define the concepts

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.860
that I have.

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:14.180
So here we have the partition points of x.

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:22.560
And above, I'm going to write now, I used to write xc, but

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:26.120
I'm going to write the partition points corresponding to x

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:26.460
prime.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:30.000
So this should be x prime sub l for some l.

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:33.020
Because remember this one's conturned.

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:35.600
That is conturned.

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:39.200
This one is contained in the other.

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:48.300
So this partition point will be x primes of l for some l.

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:54.760
And then I'll have some other ones and so on.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.520
Until I reach the last partition point from x prime, which

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:05.100
is contained in this sub interval from the partition x.

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:15.160
So I let y with a k upper.

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:26.980
So this is equal to the partition x sub k minus 1 equals x prime l

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:29.480
plus 1.

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:36.420
Until I get to some partition point x of m, which equals x of k.

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:41.380
So this is just a part of the partition x prime contained

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:45.840
in this sub interval, where these are partition points in x.

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:50.980
And then I'm going to write eta k.

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:55.640
This will be the tags that come with these points.

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:18.480
So what I want to draw attention to is that the tag

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:23.140
partition x prime, c prime, this is equal to, let me

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:23.880
write it this way.

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:27.620
Since these are sets, what I mean by, let me write it,

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:32.360
as the union of the tagged partitions.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.800
And also, this eta has nothing to do with the eta from before.

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.600
I'm just using this as notation.

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:56.400
So the full partition of x prime and xc prime tag partition

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.440
is equal to the union of these smaller partitions

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:04.360
of x k minus 1 and x k as k runs from 1 to k.

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:05.360
I hope that's clear.

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:06.840
All right.

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:15.620
So now let's compare the part of the reman sum for xxc

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:16.460
on this interval.

00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:18.080
So remember, somewhere sitting in here

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:24.320
is the tag corresponding to the kth tag for this guy.

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:29.500
Let's compare it to the part of the reman sum

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:32.440
for the x prime, xc prime, also coming from this interval.

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:46.020
In fact, let me make one more remark that since this tag

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:49.520
partition is equal to the union of these tagged partitions,

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:57.820
this implies that the reman sum corresponding to this tag

00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:03.660
partition is equal to the sum of the reman sums.

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:16.360
Corresponding to these partitions of these intervals xk minus 1

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:16.940
and xk.

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:19.140
So these are not partitions of a, b,

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:22.360
but they are partitions of xk minus 1 and xk.

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:27.060
So I hope all this is clear.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:32.420
Again, I'm just breaking these two reman sum up into parts

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:35.280
where now I'm looking at what's happening between each

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:38.100
of the partition points x of k minus 1 and x of k

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:42.680
coming from the original coarser partition x.

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:49.920
Now we compute.

00:26:50.460 --> 00:27:00.000
So if I look at,

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:09.860
so this is the part of the reman sum of xxc from this interval,

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:16.180
minus the part of the reman sum for x prime, xc prime,

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:22.380
coming from this interval.

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:28.640
Now this is equal to f of xck.

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:34.900
And so let me just rewrite this sum here.

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:44.100
x of k minus x of k minus 1, this is equal to sum from k

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:57.460
equals, let's say, j equals l plus 1 to m x prime sub

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.960
j minus x of x of x of minus 1.

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:04.700
So of the smaller ones that are in there,

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:07.860
this is just a telescoping sum.

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:10.840
So all I pick up is x of j prime sub m,

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:13.440
which is x of k, minus the first one,

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:17.800
which is x prime sub l, which is x of k minus 1.

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:20.360
Minus, and then this is by definition,

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:28.120
equal to j equals l plus 1 m f of prime

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:34.740
j x prime j minus x prime minus 1.

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:41.300
So now I combine, and then I absolute value sign on the outside.

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:43.140
And then I combine these two.

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:52.660
And so this is equal to sum from j equals l plus 1 to k

00:28:52.660 --> 00:29:08.700
of k minus j times x prime j minus x prime j minus 1.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:10.860
Absolute value.

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:17.800
Now by the triangle inequality, the absolute value of the sum

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:20.040
is less than or equal to the sum of the absolute value.

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.600
So to save myself writing, I'm

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:24.060
going to bring the absolute values inside.

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:36.840
Now x, now x is of k and x is of j.

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:40.620
They're both in the interval x of k, x of k minus 1.

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:46.220
And by what I wrote up there, another way of what

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:48.160
follows simply from the definition

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.540
of the modulus of continuity, this

00:29:50.540 --> 00:30:11.200
is less than or equal to omega f of x of k minus 1 times x

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:14.260
times j minus x prime j minus 1.

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:22.420
And this equals, now this doesn't depend on j.

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:24.460
So this is again just the telescoping sum.

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:33.380
So I just pick up times x.

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:41.060
So that's for one piece.

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:42.220
And now I just add them up.

00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:50.080
Then I look at.

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:04.240
And so like I said, this is equal to the sum of these terms

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:07.480
that look like this from k equals 1 to n.

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:11.860
This is equal to the sum of terms like this from k

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:12.680
equals 1 to n.

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:13.740
That's what I wrote up there.

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:16.300
And so if I apply the triangle inequality,

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:21.360
this is less than or equal to sum from k equals 1 to n of f

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:30.160
of xc k times xk minus xk minus 1 minus s of f.

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:47.880
A to the k, which I have this estimate right here.

00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:50.240
I've already estimated.

00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:54.140
So start it off with this.

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:56.820
I showed it was less than or equal to this.

00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:58.880
So now let me stick that estimate into here,

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:08.100
less than or equal to sum from k equals 1 to n omega f

00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:17.600
of xk minus xk minus 1 times xk minus xk minus 1.

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:25.160
Now the xk's, so another thing, which you should notice

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.080
about the modulus of continuity is,

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:32.740
if I have something here and then something bigger,

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:38.140
this set gets bigger and therefore this suit gets bigger.

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:43.460
So another property of the modulus of continuity

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:45.020
is that it's increasing, right?

00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:47.620
This just follows from looking at the definition.

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:51.740
There's more points to take a soup over if this thing gets bigger.

00:32:51.740 --> 00:33:09.960
So implies, so all of these lengths of these sub intervals,

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:12.800
the distance between partition points,

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:17.480
those are all bounded by the norm of the partition,

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:18.480
the biggest one.

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:23.540
So this is less than or equal to sum from k equals 1 to n

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:31.120
omega f of norm of x times xk minus xk minus 1.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.220
And now this doesn't depend on k,

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:38.340
so I just pick up the sum from k equals 1 to n of this,

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.400
which is a telescoping sum.

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:43.860
All I pick up is x sub n minus x sub zero,

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:45.700
which is just b minus a.

00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:56.200
So this is the estimate we wanted to prove.

00:33:59.460 --> 00:33:59.900
Okay.

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:03.800
Okay, so now I'm going to do something

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:06.080
that sacrilegious as far as boardwork goes.

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:12.000
And I'm going to erase this board and prove the next

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.480
theorem on it because I want to keep what I prove,

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:18.160
or at least the statement of what I prove around for,

00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:23.160
when we finally tackled the proof of the existence

00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:25.320
of the Riemann integral.

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:31.960
So this is in permanent form on in digital form

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:33.860
and also in the notes.

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:38.600
Also I should mention, we're not following the textbook now.

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:47.660
So you have to read the lecture notes or watch the lecture.

00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:57.200
All right, so this theorem here,

00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:01.340
theorem two allowed us to compare two Riemann sums

00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:05.960
as long as one partition is finer than the other.

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:06.660


00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:11.620
But there's a simple trick which we can now use to prove

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:16.100
how to compare any two Riemann sums

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:18.480
for any two partitions.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:20.340
So we have the following,

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:24.740
theorem three,

00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:32.420
if xc and

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:42.160
now there are any tag partitions.

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:51.300
And f is a continuous function.

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:52.880
Then

00:35:52.880 --> 00:36:01.120
if I look at the Riemann sum of this guy

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:06.920
and then compare it to the Riemann sum of the other guy,

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:13.620
this is less than or equal to the modulus of continuity

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:18.180
evaluated at the first partition

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:23.280
plus modulus of continuity applied to the second partition

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:27.280
times the length of the interval.

00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:31.560
Okay, so still it's what does this say?

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:35.780
This says that if I take two very fine partitions,

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:39.660
okay, so that the norms are very small

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:41.360
and therefore the modulus of continuity

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.040
evaluated at these norms is small.

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:46.280
Remember, the modulus of continuity converges to zero

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:48.620
as the argument goes to zero.

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:50.920
So if I take two very fine partitions,

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:55.360
then the Riemann sums are very close together.

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:57.980
The Riemann sums barely change.

00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:02.680
And so now we have some hope to see that sequences

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:05.000
of Riemann sums do in fact converge.

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:10.820
Okay, so how do we prove this?

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:15.540
It's a simple trick using the previous theorem

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:25.960
to find a third partition to be the common refinement

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:26.560
of these two.

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:31.360
So take this partition and union it with the second one

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:43.900
and take a new set of tags to be the union of the two tags.

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:45.780
All right?

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:51.000
So all the partition points of x and x prime,

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:54.500
I throw them together to get a new partition x double prime.

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:58.620
Okay, and then the tags as well.

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:09.660
Then x backwards.

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:13.500
This new partition is finer than x.

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:16.940
It's finer than x prime.

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:19.020
And therefore by theorem two,

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:26.040
we have this estimate,

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:32.140
which we can use.

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:43.140
So if I look at the difference of the Riemann sums,

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:51.340
and I add and subtract the Riemann sum corresponding

00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:54.880
to x double prime and xc double prime.

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:56.700
And then I use the triangle inequalities.

00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:57.680
I'm doing two steps here.

00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:58.140
I don't want to.

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:02.120
So add and subtract the Riemann sum corresponding to.

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:14.720
And then apply the triangle inequality.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.460
Now for this one, for both of these,

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:32.940
I can now insert this estimate here from theorem two,

00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:39.640
where what's the modulus of continuity being evaluated at?

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:46.040
That is being evaluated at the coarser partition.

00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:48.080
So this one is less than or equal to.

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:51.560
So x double prime is contained in x.

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:54.220
So this is less than or equal to the modulus of continuity

00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:57.340
evaluated at x prime times v minus a.

00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:03.780
And then for this one, x prime is coarser than x double prime.

00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:05.520
So this one is contained in x prime.

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:13.660
So plus the modulus of continuity evaluated at x prime times v minus a.

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:16.360
And that's what we wanted to prove.

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:29.160
So now we're in a position to prove the theorem of the Riemann integral.

00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:49.300
And so what we're going to do is we're first going to come up with a candidate for what the integral could be.

00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:59.140
And then we're going to show that's the actual, that that candidate satisfies the conclusion or this property that no matter what we do.

00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:10.000
No matter what partition I take with norms converging to zero, the Riemann sums converge to this number.

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:12.880
So first we have to come up with a candidate number.

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:16.880
So first take any.

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:20.760
So let's fix some partition of.

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:35.960
And for the Greek letter of fisiados out there, this is zeta.

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:55.460
And then we have to come up with a partition of a b with norm converging to zero as R goes to infinity.

00:41:57.260 --> 00:42:01.960
Okay, you can always come up with some partition.

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:06.360
So this should say be a tag.

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:18.340
You can always come up with one, you know, at least one partition or sequence of partitions.

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:26.660
So this is a be a sequence of tag partitions.

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:36.240
Okay, now this is finally right. So you can always come up with a sequence of tag partitions of a b with the norms converging to zero.

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:38.720
You know, take the first one to be just a whole interval.

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:42.020
So just a left endpoint, right endpoint.

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:46.000
Next one, add the midpoint. That's now three partition points.

00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:51.720
Now add the midpoints of the previous two intervals you had.

00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:55.300
Now add the midpoints of the intervals you had before and so on.

00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:58.840
And that will build up a sequence of partitions with norm converging to zero.

00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:10.900
So I have this fixed sequence of tag partitions.

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:14.820
And I claim that the Riemann sums converge for this guy.

00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:24.400
So claim one, the sequence of Riemann sums.

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:27.640
This is a sequence of numbers now.

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:44.000
So it converges to some number.

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:48.460
We're going to prove this by showing its Cauchy.

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:58.440
Remember Cauchy's sequences of real numbers always converge.

00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:05.920
That's this completeness property of the real numbers.

00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:19.540
So there's no other way to do this than using the definition, the epsilon m definition.

00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:21.860
So let epsilon be positive.

00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:44.760
So by theorem one, there exists a delta positive such that if a data is less than delta,

00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:48.900
I should say.

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:54.780
So we know that the modulus of continuity for f converges to zero as a data goes to zero.

00:44:55.020 --> 00:45:07.440
So for all a data less than delta, omega f of a data is less than epsilon over two times b minus a.

00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:11.860
Okay, let me put a star by this guy.

00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:38.500
Now since the norms of these partitions are converging to zero,

00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:47.900
there exists natural number m zero such that for all R bigger than or equal to m zero,

00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:57.980
the norm is less than delta.

00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:11.760
And thus for all R bigger than or equal to m zero,

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:24.840
if I look at modulus of continuity evaluated at this norm of this partition,

00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:27.640
so the norm of this partition is less than delta.

00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:34.460
And if I stick that into the modulus of continuity, anything I stick into the modulus of continuity,

00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:46.900
which is less than delta, which this is, I should be less than epsilon over two times b minus a.

00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:51.460
So really this is the one I want to star, maybe not this one.

00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:55.800
I am using this one to get it, but this is the key point here.

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:11.100
Okay, so here we're just using the fact that modulus of continuity converges to zero as the argument converges to zero and that the norms are converging to zero.

00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:12.180
Okay.

00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:28.420
Okay.

00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:36.340
So for show some scotchi, we have to now choose m. I'm going to choose m to be this m zero.

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:49.840
Then roll R, R prime, bigger than or equal to m, which remember we've chosen to be m zero.

00:47:49.840 --> 00:48:13.820
So we have that absolute value of s of f x, R, R minus the remonsum, now with R prime, absolute value.

00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:28.900
This is by theorem three, which we proved over there, right, is bounded by the sum of the modulus of continuities evaluated at the norms times b minus a.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.380
Now R and R prime are bigger than or equal to m zero.

00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:58.020
So this is this line here, this is by theorem three.

00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:15.820
But now by star, by our choice of m zero, this is less than epsilon over two times b minus a plus epsilon over two, b minus a times b minus a.

00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:22.420
This is now by star, which equals epsilon.

00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:32.600
And therefore this sequence of remonsums would respect to this one sequence converges.

00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:33.780


00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:38.000
And so we've proven the claim.

00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:46.080
Let me call the limit of this sequence something. I'm going to call it L.

00:49:46.080 --> 00:50:04.240
In fact, let's call it i for integral. Let i be the limit as R goes to infinity of, oh, like I messed up my notation earlier.

00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:11.620
Sorry about that, the y's and x's and x's should have been y's and z's.

00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:22.880
And then y here, y here.

00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:34.440
Now that's right. So i is defined to be the limit of these guys.

00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:43.780
So now we have to do one last thing in order to prove the theorem.

00:50:46.480 --> 00:51:03.660
So I have this guy, I have this, this number i. And I claim now that i satisfies the properties of the theorem, namely that if I take any sequence of remonsums or any sequence of tagged partitions,

00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:11.220
and take the remonsums, that converges to i. We've just shown that there is one that converges to i. That's how i is defined.

00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:19.060
We took one partition, a sequence of tagged partitions, and showed that the remonsums converge to some number i.

00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:23.920
So this number i depends on the partition, which I chose in the beginning.

00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:35.680
Now we want to show that this i, in fact, has that property that no matter what partition, sequence of partitions I take, the remonsums converge to i.

00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:41.160
So that's the second. And last thing I need to do to prove this theorem.

00:51:43.600 --> 00:52:10.040
So claim, let x be now any sequence of tagged partitions, which would be coming finer and finer.

00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:34.280
So with the norm converging to zero, then I want to show that limit as r goes to infinity of the remonsums corresponding to this sequence of partial sums,

00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:45.580
this sequence of partitions exists and equals this number i, which I obtained from this one sequence of partitions.

00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:54.080
So once I've proven this, like this is claim, two, once I've proven this, then I'm done.

00:52:55.600 --> 00:53:13.880
Okay? This number i is therefore satisfies the properties of, satisfies that property that no matter what sequence of partitions I take, the sequence of remonsums with respect to these partitions converges to that number.

00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:20.180
Of course, here I'm calling it i, but we denoted by the integral from a, b of f of x dx.

00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:32.560
So to prove this is not too difficult using what we have on the board.

00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:38.300
So remember i is the limit with respect to this one sequence of partitions.

00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:46.280
And now we have an arbitrary sequence of partitions, which we want to show the remonsums converge to this number as well.

00:53:53.560 --> 00:54:11.680
So with y sub r or y r and zeta r, you know, the partitions from before, we have by the triangle inequality.

00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:30.540
If I look at the remonsum with respect to this arbitrary partition now, subtract i, I want to show this converges to zero.

00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:34.140
So I'm just going to bound this by something that converges to zero.

00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:39.380
And then by, you know, the usual argument with the squeeze theorem that implies this thing converges to zero.

00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:53.760
So adding and subtracting the remonsum associated to the partition y and zeta's, this is less than or equal to, in the triangle inequality,

00:54:56.920 --> 00:55:18.940
minus s, f of minus, plus now, minus i.

00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:26.360
And so I'm almost there. This thing now, I use theorem three.

00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:47.660
So this is less than or equal to, and b minus a plus,

00:55:55.780 --> 00:56:04.620
s sub f of my sub r minus i.

00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:19.600
Now, the norms of x, the norm of the x sub r, this is converging to zero.

00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:40.740
So this converges to, since the modulus of continuity goes to zero as the argument goes to zero, plus, remember the same thing for this guy, this also converges to zero, plus,

00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:57.660
and how did we define i? It was defined as the limit of the remonsums corresponding to this first fixed partition, and therefore this thing in absolute value converges to zero, as r converges to infinity.

00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:09.680
So the absolute value of this thing, this remonsum minus i, is bounded by something converging to zero as r goes to infinity.

00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:23.600
And therefore, by the squeeze theorem, we conclude that the limit as r goes to infinity of s.

00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:44.180
So in other words, no matter what sequence of partitions we take, with norms converging to zero, the remonsums converge to the same number i.

00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:46.980
And that's the end of the proof.

00:57:54.800 --> 00:58:11.160
Okay, so we, you know, it took a lot of work to do this. I mean, this is the work of remons, so, who was one of the greatest mathematicians of all time.

00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:22.760
You know, Vierstras was definitely one of the greatest analysts of all time, Riemann, just as a mathematician in general, was one of the greatest of all time.

00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:50.160
He not only did analysis, you know, he applied analysis to number theory. This is a content of the famous Riemann hypothesis, which maybe you've heard about, which is worth a million dollars, says something about the zeros of a certain function, which then gives you information about prime numbers.

00:58:50.160 --> 00:59:01.400
But, and he also had deep contributions to the foundations of geometry, or I should say the foundations of differential geometry.

00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:09.400
But, truly some deep stuff going on.

00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:24.660
All right, so now we have this notion of a Riemann integral. It's this number integral, a, b, f of x, d x, which has this property, no matter what sequence of partitions I take, with norms converging to zero.

00:59:24.660 --> 00:59:43.680
So, the partial sums converge to this number. So, I'm often going to denote, so, if you like, this is some alternative notation I'll use.

00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:57.900
Instead of writing f of x, d x, I may just write, you know, integral a, b, f.

00:59:57.900 --> 01:00:10.880
Okay, so, you know, this definition of the Riemann integral looks terrifying if you want to actually try and compute it, and it is.

01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:20.740
So, you know, that's the miracle of the fundamental theorem of calculus is that it gives us a way to compute it. And that's why I'm not doing any examples of computing it right now.

01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:39.260
But, we can still learn about some properties of the Riemann integral without that to start. So, so now we're moving on to some properties of the integral.

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:58.800
And the first is that it, so this is a limiting process, but this limiting process is linear in f. Okay, if I look at Riemann sums of, let's say, f plus g, that's equal to the Riemann sum of f plus the Riemann sum of g.

01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:08.120
And therefore, since integration is a limit of this of Riemann sums, then integration should also be linear as well.

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:24.960
And that's the first theorem is the linearity of the Riemann sum of Riemann integration f and g are in a, b.

01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:52.020
And alpha is in R. Then, so first off, alpha f plus g, that's going to be, so that should not be in a, b, this should be a continuous, it's the end of a long day.

01:01:52.020 --> 01:02:05.220
Okay, so, sorry if I'm losing a little steam here towards the end. Anyways, alpha f plus g, if f and g are continuous, this is a continuous function as well, so its integral is meaningful.

01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:34.000
And its integral is equal to alpha times the integral f plus the integral of g. Okay, so what's the proof? The proof is basically what I said right before I stated the theorem that Riemann sums are linear in the function.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:59.780
So, and then we just take a limit. Let's take a sequence of tag partitions with norms converting to zero.

01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:27.420
So, the integral is R goes to infinity. Then, if I look at the Riemann sum associated to alpha f plus g, it is easy to see from the definition.

01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:53.500
This is a sum from k equals 1 to n. So, this is easy to see that this is equal to alpha times the Riemann sum associated to f plus that guy.

01:03:54.840 --> 01:04:11.540
And now, I just take a limit. So, take the limit as R goes to infinity. The left hand side converges to the Riemann integral of alpha f plus g.

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:26.680
The limit as R goes to infinity converges to because we know limits respect linear operations. The limit of the right hand side is going to be alpha times the limit plus the limit.

01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:50.880
And therefore, this is equal to alpha times integral a b f plus integral a b g. Okay, so like differentiation, it's also what one would call a linear operator.

01:04:50.880 --> 01:05:04.900
It takes a function and spits something out but does it in a linear way. So, for us, it takes a continuous function and spits out a real number in a linear way.

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:19.960
And that the integral of alpha f plus g is equal to alpha times f plus g. Just like differentiation, the derivative of alpha f plus g, if everything is differentiable, is equal to alpha times the derivative of f plus the derivative of g.

01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:41.040
But Riemann integration, the Riemann integral or integration in general, is in some sense, I don't want to say it's not miraculous. It still is a bit of a miracle that exists, that it exists for all continuous functions.

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:59.720
But it's not as destructive an operator as taking the derivative. If you take as your baseline continuous functions. We did last lecture, we constructed a continuous function which is differentiable nowhere.

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:08.740
So, with differentiation, you can take a continuous function and not be able to take as derivative anywhere.

01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:23.560
Well, with integration, if you start off with a continuous function, you can always take its integral. So somehow, integration is much more smoother processed than differentiation.

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:26.560
All right, so I think we'll stop there.
