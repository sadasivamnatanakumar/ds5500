00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:24.640
So last time we proved the following theorem that if I have a convergent series,

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:37.720
then this implies that the limit as n goes to infinity of x of n equals 0.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.200
So a natural question is, you know, as a beginning,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.700
the first thing that's math class does the converse hold.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.240
Is this a two-way street or a one-way street?

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:09.320
So if the individual terms in this series converges to 0, does this imply that the series converges?

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.800
And I'm sure you answered this question in some form in a previous calculus class,

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.820
and the answer to this question is no.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.820
So what's the counter example?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.320
It's a so-called harmonic series, which corresponds to kind of our favorite sequence,

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.440
which converges to 0.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.120
So we'll state this as a theorem.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:02:01.520
The series sum from n equals 1 to infinity of 1 over n does not converge.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:14.880
So how are we going to prove this theorem by showing a sequence of partial sums?

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.140
A subsequence of partial sums for this guy does not converge.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.200
So if it were to converge, then the sequence of partial sums converges,

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.340
and therefore every subsequence of partial sums converge.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.180
So what's the strategy?

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:56.840
We're going to show that there exists a subsequence of partial sums here.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.000
Let's make this mk.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:11.160
So remember the partial sums are simply summing up the first, so the index here is m sub k.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:20.980
So the first m sub k terms when we're in diverges.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.800
So this is enough to show that the full series doesn't converge again.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:31.120
Because if it did converge, the partial sums, the sequence of partial sums converges,

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.820
and therefore every subsequence of partial sums converges.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.180
So if we're able to show there exists a subsequence which diverges, then we're done.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.660
In fact, what we're going to do is something a little bit stronger.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.220
We're going to show that there exists a subsequence of partial sums,

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.400
which not only diverges, but is unbounded.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.420
And therefore the entire sequence of partial sums is unbounded.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.140
So if we're able to show there exists a subsequence which is unbounded,

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.180
then the entire sequence of partial sums is unbounded, so it can't converge.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:17.200
Because remember, convergent sequences imply bounded sequences.

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:25.820
So we're going to look at when m sub k is dietic.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.940
So for some reason I switched indices from k to l in my note.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.500
So instead we're going to go from m sub l.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:05:02.560
So let l be a natural number, and we'll consider the partial sum corresponding

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.080
to adding up the first two to the l terms.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.160
Now you may ask why two to the l, why not three to the l?

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.160
Well, four to the l will be a subsequence of that.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.080
But two to the l is you could do three to the l, you could do five to the l.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.060
But two to the l seems is this sufficient for our purposes.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:41.980
So what we're going to do is we're going to take this partial sum and bound it from below by something which is quite large.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.060
So first off, all of these partial sums are bounded from below by zero, right?

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.020
There are some of non-negative terms.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:06:01.060
So we write as two to the l, this is equal to one plus a half plus.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:15.300
And I'm going to put parentheses around that plus a third plus a fourth plus a fifth plus a sixth plus a seventh plus an eighth.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:28.080
So how I'm grouping these terms is I'm grouping them according to whether the denominator falls between a power of two and the next power of two.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.280
And then plus.

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:46.020
To the l minus one plus one plus one over two to the l.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.880
Now I can write this partial sum.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:00.900
So I've grouped terms this way. What is this in terms of precise symbols?

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:05.680
This is one plus sum from lambda equals one to l.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:18.520
Sum from n equals two to the lambda minus one plus one to the lambda one over n.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:25.820
So these lambdas are now parameterizing whether what power of two on that.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.420
So when lambda equals one, I'm at this block.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.520
One lambda equals two. I'm at this block.

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:43.220
And then I'm summing up the terms that have denominator between that power and the next of two.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.800
So I have this.

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:56.720
And now I bound that sum from below.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:05.320
Because again, I'm trying to show that this sequence of partial sums is unbounded.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.380
So I bound it from below.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:15.340
I sum from lambda equals one to l.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:26.020
Sum from n equals two to the lambda minus one plus one to the lambda.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:33.020
And now for each of these, n is between two to the lambda.

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:47.060
Now for n between these two numbers, n is one over n is always bigger than or equal to when I plug in the biggest bound here, two to the lambda.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:53.380
Okay.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.480
And now I just have a sum.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.560
So over n, but there's no n in this term.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:09.340
So I just add up all the number of terms in a given block.

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:13.960
And this is equal to, so first I have one over two to the lambda coming from here.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:22.020
And then sum from n equals two to the lambda minus one plus one to the lambda times one.

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:24.580
So again, I'm kind of going a little slow here.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:41.960
And this is just equal to l one over two to the lambda times the number of terms I have here, which is two to the lambda minus one.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.980
Two to the lambda minus one plus one.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.280
So this minus this plus one.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:04.280
So this is equal to one plus lambda equals one to l one over two lambda.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.040
And then, so this one cancels with this one.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:11.080
And then I have two to the lambda minus one, which I can bring out.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.580
So this is just one.

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:24.920
Okay. And I get one plus sum from lambda equals one to l.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.300
And this two to the lambda cancels with this two to the lambda.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:29.820
And I'm left with just a half.

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:32.980
Okay.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.540
And this is big.

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:41.380
And this is equal to, now remember, there's no sum here in lambda.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:48.720
So this is just one plus l over two.

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:51.520
Okay.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.040
So what did we do?

00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:00.700
We basically showed that each of these blocks is bounded from below by a half.

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.360
That's this term that we get right here in the end.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:09.860
Yeah. And we can see this if we just kind of go through the first three terms, which I have written here.

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:14.180
So one half is clearly bounded below by a half.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:20.160
One third plus a fourth is bounded below by a fourth plus a fourth, because a third is bigger than that.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.940
So a fourth plus a fourth is a half.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:30.000
If I look at this next block, that's one over five is bigger than or equal to one over eight.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.920
So is one over six. So is one over seven.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:38.800
So this sum is bigger than or equal to one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth,

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.200
which equals a half plus and then so on.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.780
So maybe I should have said that before.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.420
I went into the actual computation.

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:51.540
But in the end, we get that this sub sequence of partial sums as to the 2L.

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.820
So let me just summarize.

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:03.780
This is bigger than or equal to l plus two over two.

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:04.980
Okay.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:11.200
And as l goes, as l gets very large, this thing gets very large.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.180
So this implies s to the 2L.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:39.680
This sub sequence, l equals one to infinity, is unbounded, which implies that the full sub sequence or the full sequence of partial sums is unbounded.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:45.260
And therefore the sequence is not the sequence of partial sums is not converged.

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.380
And therefore that series does not converge.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:50.740
Okay.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:10.560
All right. So we see that the converse is not hold for that question or for that theorem.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:23.380
I will just make a very passing mention to the fact that there are fields for which that does hold.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:29.220
So not ordered fields because again, ordered fields with the least upper bound property have to be have to be r.

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:36.660
And therefore we've just shown that the converse of that theorem does not hold.

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:51.960
But in fact, if you look at the so-called periodic numbers, they do have this property that if the sequence of terms converges to zero, then the series converges.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.680
But we will never see periodic numbers.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:14:03.620
I just wanted to do a little lip service to that fact that there are at least fields of numbers that do have this property.

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:16.320
Okay. So we had a theorem about limits of sequences and how they interact with algebraic operations.

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:20.400
This naturally implies a theorem about series.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:27.520
So let alpha be an r.

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:39.860
And let's suppose we have two convergent series.

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:59.600
Then if I look at the series alpha xn plus yn.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:05.960
So the new terms, so the terms of my new series are alpha times x of n plus y sub n. This is a convergent series.

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:30.240
And the sum of this series is equal to kind of what you expect.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:38.680
So the sum of the series alpha xn plus yn is equal to alpha times the sum of xn plus the sum of yn.

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:49.440
So this theorem follows essentially, or kind of immediately, from what we did for sequences.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:02.500
So this is partial sum satisfy.

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:19.580
If I look at some stopping at m alpha xn plus yn, now just by the linearity of just adding up, finally many terms, I'm not going to put something down below because I really don't need to.

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:31.920
So this is equal to alpha times the partial sum of x sub n plus the partial sum corresponding to y sub n.

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:42.880
And so we're assuming this sequence of partial sums converges and this sequence of partial sums converges.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:49.480
So therefore this term on the right hand side converges, which implies the left side converges.

00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:13.940
So by the linear properties of limits, namely that the limit of the sum is the sum of the limits.

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:27.120
And multiplication just by fixed real numbers, commutes with taking limits, we get that limit as m goes to infinity.

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:55.860
So the partial sum corresponding to the new series equals alpha plus xn plus yn.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.320
And that's the end.

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:27.900
Alright, so now remember we had certain sequences, which we could tell whether they converge.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:55.540
So we could tell them that they converge kind of a little bit easier than just an arbitrary sequence.

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:02.480
So we could tell them that they converge.

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:06.320
So this is a non-negative terms that I'm adding up.

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:16.800
Because the partial sums corresponding to a series that has non-negative terms form a monotone increasing sequence.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.300
And that's not too hard to show.

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:26.400
So this is the following theorem.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:37.360
So this is about, now we're going to discuss a little bit about sequences which, or look at sequences which have non-negative terms.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.140
So the theorem is the following.

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:18.740
The sequence of partial sums, S sub n, so let's actually, is bounded.

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:32.440
And again, I mean the way we see this is just that when these terms are non-negative, the sequence of partial sums is monotone.

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:40.280
So here's the proof. It's quite easy.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:51.680
So we have for all n, natural number, make that m.

00:20:51.680 --> 00:21:12.000
So if I look at S sub n plus 1, this is equal to, so this is the m plus 1 partial sum, sum from n equals 1 to m plus 1, x sub n, this is equal to sum from n equals m, x n plus x m plus 1.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:18.660
And now the x m plus 1 term is non-negative, right? We're assuming all the terms are non-negative.

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:29.380
So this right-hand side, so this is certainly bigger than or equal to sum from n equals 1 to m of x n and that equals sm.

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:41.440
So just summarizing for all natural numbers m, this m plus 1 is bigger than or equal to sm.

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:45.660
Yeah, if I just keep adding non-negative things, the partial sums are getting bigger.

00:21:45.660 --> 00:22:05.260
So partial sums is a monotone.

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:18.940
So maybe I should have stated this slightly differently just so that you don't think this is part of one of the if and only if, I mean this is the assumption that we have for this whole statement.

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:31.280
Suppose this, so the conclusion is that this converges if and only if the sequence of partial sums is bounded.

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:41.540
So based on the assumption that all the terms are non-negative, we see that the sequence of partial sums is monotone increasing.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:54.740
That's by what we prove for sequences, every monotone increasing sequence converges if and only if it's bounded.

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.180
Okay, and that's it.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:40.180
Okay, so now not every series we look at does have non-negative terms, but we can always form a certain series from those terms to make a new non-negative,

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:53.560
a new series with non-negative terms which gives us information about the original series. What am I going on about and look at the convergence properties of that new series.

00:23:53.560 --> 00:24:14.100
So we have the following definition that a series converges absolutely.

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:18.260
We say we have absolute convergence.

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:36.520
If the series formed by taking the absolute values of these terms, if this series converges.

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:51.560
Okay, so what I was trying to get at before I stated this definition is that absolute convergence implies usual convergence.

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:12.700
If I had this series converging absolutely, then the original series converges.

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:24.060
Okay, now before I prove this theorem, let me prove a little small theorem. I can't remember if I gave it for an assignment or not.

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:32.060
But it's essentially a triangle inequality for however many terms you like.

00:25:36.460 --> 00:26:00.220
So we'll prove this theorem in just a minute, but first let me prove the following theorem that if m is bigger than or equal to 2 and x1 up to xm, r and r, then sum from n equals 1 to m,

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:10.360
xn, take the absolute value of this sum, this is less than or equal to sum from n equals 1 to m of the absolute value.

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:16.980
Okay, when m equals 2, this is just the usual form of the triangle inequality.

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:30.380
So m equals 2, this is just saying x1 plus x2 is always less than or equal to x1 plus x2, which is just the triangle inequality.

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:48.500
Okay, but typically how life works, at least in analysis, if you can do it for two things, then you can do it for n things or m things in this case by induction.

00:26:48.500 --> 00:27:01.200
And so that's how we're going to prove this. So we'll first prove this triangle inequality by induction. So prove now.

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:09.380
And the induction proofs we've done so far in, little n is our thing that we're inducting on.

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:20.480
So one in this statement m is the thing, induction on m. Okay, so let's look at the base case, which is m equals 2.

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:40.360
So then this is just the triangle inequality for two real numbers that we've already proved before.

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:46.880
Okay, x1 plus x2 and absolute value is always less than or equal to sum of x1 plus the sum of x2.

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:51.940
I mean sum of absolute value of x1 plus n to x, the absolute value of x2.

00:27:55.140 --> 00:28:01.500
So the base case is fine. So now we do the inductive step.

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:13.840
So I'll assume the statement that I want to prove, usually I used m, but now I'll go to the next letter l going in reverse alphabetical order.

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:26.820
Suppose if x1, xl, and r.

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:42.840
So let's actually instead of just restating all that, just call the statement star.

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:57.040
So suppose star holds 4m equals l. And now we want to prove that star holds for m equals l plus 1.

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:11.200
Now we want to show star holds for m equals l plus 1.

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:29.080
Okay, so let x1 up to xl plus 1 be in r.

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:41.520
Then if I look at the sum, sum from n equals 1 to l plus 1 xn.

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:53.340
This is equal to sum from n equals 1 to l xn plus xl plus 1, an absolute value.

00:29:55.340 --> 00:30:19.120
By the usual triangle inequality for two terms, this is less than or equal to sum from n equals 1 to l of xn and absolute value of xl plus 1 by usual triangle inequality.

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:25.880
And now this term, since I'm assuming m equals l holds.

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:40.060
So the m equals l case says this is less than or equal to sum from n equals 1 to l of xn plus xl plus 1, an absolute value.

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:59.740
So this is by inductive hypothesis. And this is just equal to sum from n equals 1 to l plus 1 xn.

00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:04.780
So we've proven the case for now m equals l plus 1.

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:26.420
And that concludes the proof of this generalized triangle inequality with arbitrary number of terms.

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:38.140
So let's get back to proving the theorem that absolute convergence implies convergence.

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:43.440
So we'll do that by proving that absolute convergence implies that the series is koshi.

00:31:47.920 --> 00:32:05.960
So proof, and this is of the theorem just before the theorem we proved that absolute convergence implies usual convergence.

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:29.060
So we will prove that in fact this series is koshi assuming that assuming absolute convergence.

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:47.820
And from last time we had proved the statement or at least has followed from statement for sequences that a koshi series converges.

00:32:47.820 --> 00:33:15.780
So we have to prove that the series is koshi. Remember this means for all epsilon positive there exists a natural number m such that for all l bigger than m bigger than or equal to m.

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:27.540
If I look at the sum from n equals m plus 1 to l of xn, this is less than epsilon.

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:32.620
So let epsilon be positive.

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:54.760
So since we're assuming that the series is absolutely convergent, this implies that the series with absolute values here is also koshi.

00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:12.340
So that means that there exists a natural number m sub zero such that for all l bigger than m bigger than or equal to m sub zero.

00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:31.080
So if I look at the sum of absolute values from n plus 1 to l, this is less than epsilon. Now this should have an absolute value on the outside, but this is a sum of non-negative terms so the absolute value can be removed.

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:51.320
I mean you can essentially see where we're going based on what's written on the board, what we want to prove and what we know and this triangle inequality.

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:02.740
So choose m to be m sub zero.

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:21.560
Then if l is bigger than m is bigger than or equal to m, then absolute value of the sum from n plus 1 to l, sub n.

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:35.780
This is less than or equal to the sum from n equals m plus 1 to l of the absolute values of x sub n by the theorem we proved just a minute ago.

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:46.440
And this is less than epsilon by our choice of m. m is equal to m zero and for m zero we have this inequality right here.

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:58.180
This series is Koshy which implies it converges.

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:27.540
So basically the only test you know for determining when a series is convergent is in one of two possibilities.

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:35.480
Either a it has a very simple form and it's not so all the terms are not non-negative but the terms have a very simple form.

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:44.220
That's the alternating series test which will discuss in a little bit possibly the next lecture.

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:50.400
And then when a series converges absolutely we have a lot of tests for that.

00:36:54.100 --> 00:37:12.960
We'll see that series which converge absolutely somehow are not fickle meaning I can rearrange the terms and the rearrange series will still converge absolutely in converged to the same thing that the original series converged to.

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:34.600
So let me just make a brief comment after this theorem we proved that absolute convergence implies usual convergence and tie in a little bit to what I just said there.

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:56.560
So we'll show that the series sum from one to infinity of minus one to the n one over n this converges.

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:13.280
But note that this series does not converge absolutely.

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:30.620
Right because when I take absolute values I just get some of one over n which is the harmonic series which we just showed a few minutes ago is divergent.

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:44.220
Now we're going to move on to some convergence tests.

00:38:56.660 --> 00:39:11.320
Now when it comes to convergence tests what these all follow from is basically what we know about geometric series and the following comparison tests.

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:19.280
Although when I do the proofs of the other convergence tests I won't actually state that I'm using the comparison test but that's kind of what's really getting used.

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:36.180
So the first test we have is the comparison test and the statement is the following.

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:47.940
Suppose we're all in a natural number we're looking at non-negative terms with one smaller than the other.

00:39:52.520 --> 00:40:06.460
Then the conclusion is if the bigger one converges this implies that the smaller one converges

00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:25.780
and if the smaller one diverges this implies that the bigger one diverges.

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:49.980
So how we're going to prove this is we're dealing with terms that are non-negative so we'll use this theorem about a series of non-negative terms.

00:40:52.480 --> 00:41:02.320
So we use that theorem we proved that a series of non-negative terms converges if and only if the sequence of partial sums is bounded.

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:32.300
So if this series converges this implies that the sequence of partial sums is bounded which implies that means that the sequence of partial sums is bounded.

00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:49.520
So that means that there exists something non-negative number such that for all natural numbers m some from n equals 1 to m of y sub n is less than or equal to b.

00:41:56.520 --> 00:42:19.260
So this immediately implies that since all the x n's are less than or equal to the y n's we get that the mth partial sum corresponding to the x n's which is less than or equal to the mth partial sum for the y n's.

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:22.120
So this is also less than or equal to b for all m.

00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:47.200
So the sequence of partial sums corresponding to the x n's is bounded and therefore by the theorem we proved which I think I have erased already.

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:55.040
So the series converges.

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:20.900
Now proving to is essentially it's kind of the same thing except the inequalities go the other way and the x n's are getting bigger which implies the y n's are also getting or the partial sums corresponding to the x n's is getting bigger.

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:25.080
So we are implying that the partial sums corresponding to the y n's are also getting bigger.

00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:50.360
So now two if some if the series diverges then this implies that partial sums is unbounded.

00:43:53.600 --> 00:44:00.760
We will now prove that this implies that the partial sums corresponding to the y n's are unbounded.

00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:24.860
Now remember what it means for a sequence to be bounded is that there exists a non-negative number b such that for all m I have that bound.

00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:33.860
So to say it's unbounded it means that for all b there exists a little m bigger than or equal to capital n such that that inequality is reversed.

00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:55.720
So when we put here in a box what this actually means again this means that for all b bigger than or equal to zero there exists a m natural numbers so that the y n equals 1 to m is bigger than or equal to b.

00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:08.320
That's what this means. So this is for all statements so I have to be able to prove it for every b b bigger than or equal to zero.

00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:36.820
Now since we know that the partial sums corresponding to the x n's is unbounded this implies that there exists an m natural number such that sum from n equals 1 to m of x n is bigger than or equal to b.

00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:53.440
Now let me say again just to show it's unbounded I should really have so for a sequence to be unbounded I should have an absolute value here is bigger than or equal to b but all of these terms is non-negative.

00:45:53.440 --> 00:46:02.360
All of these terms are non-negative and therefore I can remove the absolute values and the same thing here.

00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:21.260
So there exists a natural number m so that I have this and so let me put a little m zero there because we have to somehow show there exists a little m choose m to be this m zero.

00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:39.120
So now if we look at the partial sums for the y n's this is bigger than or equal to because m equals m zero it's this term which is bigger than or equal to b.

00:46:41.940 --> 00:47:01.060
Thus this proves partial sums corresponding to the y n is unbounded and therefore this series diverges.

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:25.020
So let's use the comparison theorem to consider series like 1 over n p series and prove when they do converge.

00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:37.460
So theorem or p a real number.

00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:59.820
Some n equals 1 to infinity 1 over n to the p converges if and only if p is bigger than 1.

00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:25.720
So for the proof now why does the series converging imply p has to be bigger than 1.

00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:39.240
So we'll do this by contradiction so suppose 1 over n to the p equals 1 to infinity converges.

00:48:42.840 --> 00:49:03.660
So we'll do the proof by contradiction that p has to be bigger than 1. Suppose p is less than or equal to 1 then 1 over n to the p when p is less than or equal to 1 this is bigger than or equal to 1 over n.

00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:22.660
And this implies since 1 over n since the series corresponding to 1 over n diverges implies that the series corresponding to 1 over n to the p diverges by the comparison test.

00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:45.280
This is a direct contradiction to what we're assuming that the series converges.

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:56.140
So this must be false and p must be bigger than 1. So we've shown that if this series converges then p has to be bigger than 1.

00:49:56.140 --> 00:50:13.160
So now let's prove the other direction and suppose p is bigger than 1 and prove that the p series 1 over n to the p converges.

00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:33.780
So the way we're going to do this is kind of how we showed that the harmonic series is divergent.

00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:44.660
So what we're going to do is first we're going to show that there is a sub sequence of partial sums corresponding to this guy that is bounded.

00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:54.260
So remember to prove that this converges if and only if the sequence of partial sums is bounded.

00:50:54.760 --> 00:51:01.960
And what we're going to first do kind of towards that is prove that there is a sub sequence of partial sums which is bounded.

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:28.840
So we make a first claim that the sequence of partial sums so s 2 to the k.

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:40.860
So this is sum from n goes 1 to 2 to the k of 1 over n to the p. So all k and natural number.

00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:56.080
So this partial sum is bounded by a fixed number depending on p 1 plus 1 minus 2 to the minus p minus 1.

00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:06.560
In other words there's this sub sequence of partial sums corresponding to s 2 to the k is bounded.

00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:25.520
So again we do this by grouping these terms according to which power of 2 the denominator is between and then estimate from above now rather than from below like we did for the harmonic series.

00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:43.440
So we have s 2 to the k equals 1. So again we're grouping these terms according to whether they're where they fall.

00:52:44.040 --> 00:53:09.460
So this is just write this out one more time. This is equal to 1 plus 1 half to the p plus 1 over 3 to the p plus 1 over 4 to the p plus 1 over 5 to the p plus 1 over 8 to the p plus.

00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:12.860
And then up until the last term.

00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:27.240
Now I can write this as 1 plus the sum from l equals 1 to k.

00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:44.500
So the number of blocks I have here. And then now the terms that come in each of these blocks 1 over n to the p.

00:53:50.100 --> 00:54:02.100
And so now I estimate 1 over n not from below by this guy but from above by putting in the smallest n that n is in this block.

00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:08.660
So this is less than or equal to 1 plus sum from l equals 1 to k.

00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:23.460
So I'm from n equals 2 to the l minus 1 plus 1 to the l 1 over 2 to the l minus 1 plus 1 raised to the pth power.

00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:38.660
Now this plus 1 is just making things bigger on the bottom. So if I remove it I've made things bigger overall for this fraction.

00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:55.840
So this is less than or equal to sum from 1 equals l equals 1 to k. Some n equals 2 to the l minus 1 to the l times 1 over 2 to the p times l minus 1.

00:54:57.620 --> 00:55:07.120
And now this thing here, if we do the same algebra we did a minute ago this is equal to 1 l equals 1 to k.

00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:16.780
Now I have this term coming out. And then the number of terms I have here just like I did for the harmonic series.

00:55:16.780 --> 00:55:24.560
This is equal to 2 to the l minus 1 plus 1 plus 1.

00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:40.160
And now this is equal to 1 plus sum from l equals 1 to k.

00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:56.260
And so this whole thing here is equal to 2 to the l minus 1. So I get 2 to the minus p minus 1 l minus 1.

00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:04.120
Now I can shift this index. Actually this.

00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:17.640
So I guess I could have made that sharper but it doesn't matter. I could shift this index l by no. Okay. So l starts at 1 and goes to k.

00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:33.660
And here I have the sum l minus 1 so I can shift this index to go from now l equals 0 to k minus 1 to the minus p minus 1 l.

00:56:36.140 --> 00:56:45.120
Okay. So I should have, this is like making a change of variables l prime equals l minus 1. And so let me put l prime instead of l.

00:56:49.140 --> 00:57:08.560
Now this, so p is bigger than 1. Okay. So this is corresponds to a geometric series now. So let me actually rewrite this as 1 over 2 to the p minus 1 to the l prime.

00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:24.720
Okay. When p is bigger than 1, then 1 over 2 to the p minus 1 is less than 1. So this thing is a k minus 1 partial sum for the series, geometric series with this as r. Right.

00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:34.900
So this is always bounded above by. If I add up all the terms.

00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:46.920
This equals that thing that I have up there 1 over 1 minus 2 to the minus p minus 1. Okay.

00:57:55.840 --> 00:58:05.660
So that proves that along this subsequence, these partial sums are bounded by this fixed number.

00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:19.220
And now I claim that this proves that the whole sequence of partial sums is bounded. Okay. In fact, by the same number.

00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:26.000
For all, nm natural number.

00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:38.280
nm is less than or equal to this number again. 1 minus 2 to the minus p minus 1. Okay.

00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:52.880
So let m be a natural number. So we're trying to prove this bound. What do we do? We find a dietic number of number of the form 2 to the k bigger than m.

00:58:55.260 --> 00:59:01.540
And since 2 to the m is bigger than m, I think that's maybe one of the first things we did by induction.

00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:18.680
So we get that s to the m or s of m, which is the nth partial sum of non-negative terms. This is going to be less than or equal to since this is a monotone increasing guy.

00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:31.540
This is going to be less than or equal to s to the 2m, which is less than or equal to 1 plus 1 minus 2 to the minus p minus 1. Okay.

00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:51.580
Okay. That's the sequence of partial sums is bounded, which implies the series converges.

00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:55.580
And that's the end of the proof. And I think we'll stop there.
