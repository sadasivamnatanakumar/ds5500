00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.120
So if you remember last time, we looked at parametric equations.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:43.220
So as a way of describing the motion of a point that moves in the plane or in space,

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.700
as a function of time or your favorite parameter that will tell you how far the motion has progressed.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.180
And I think we did in detail the example of the cycloid, which is the curve traced

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:07.600
by a point on a wheel that's rolling on a flat surface.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:19.360
So we have this example where we have this wheel that's rolling on the x-axis.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.040
And we have this point on the wheel.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:33.980
And as it moves around, it traces a trajectory that looked more or less like this.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.420
OK, so I'm trying a new color.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.720
Is this visible from the back?

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:39.140
Good.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.460
So no more blue.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.640
OK.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.700
So remember, in general, we are trying to find the position.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:10.940
So x of t, y of t, maybe z of t, if we're in space, of a moving point, a longer trajectory.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.740
And one way to think about this is in terms of the position vector.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:34.300
So the position vector is just the vector whose components are the coordinates of the point.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.020
OK, so if you prefer, that's the same thing as the vector from the origin.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.760
So again, to the moving point.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.940
So maybe our point is here, p.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:03:01.060
So this vector here is vector op.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.120
t.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.780
And that's also the position vector of t.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:31.040
So just to give you, again, that example, if I take the cycloid for a wheel of radius

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:44.540
1, and let's say that we are going at unit speed so that the angle that we used as a parameter

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.760
less time is the same thing as time.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:55.640
Then the position vector, in this case, we found to be, just to make sure that they have

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.600
it right, t minus sine t and cosine t.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.220
No, 1 minus cosine t.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.600
OK, same, that's formula that you should have in your notes from less time, except we had

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.040
theta instead of t because we were using the angle.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.820
But now I'm saying we're moving at unit speed, so time and angle are the same thing.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:30.280
OK, so now what's interesting about this is we can analyze the motion in more detail.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:36.020
So now that we know the position of a point as a function of time, we can try to study

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.580
how it varies and the particular things like the speed and the acceleration.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.640
So let's start with speed.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.780
Well, in fact, we can do better than speed.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.000
Let's not start with speed.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.580
So speed is a number.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.500
It tells you how fast you're going along your trajectory.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.200
I mean, if you're driving in a car, then it tells you how fast you're going.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.280
But unless you have one of these fancy cars with a GPS, it doesn't tell you in which direction

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.700
you're going.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.400
And that's useful information, too, if you're trying to figure out what your trajectory

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.840
is.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.420
So in fact, there's two aspects to it.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.460
One is how fast you're going and the other is in what direction you're going.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.480
That means actually we should use a vector, maybe, to think about this.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.100
And so that's called the velocity vector.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.220
And the way we can get it, so it's called, usually, V.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.660
So V here stands for velocity, more than four vector.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:44.700
And you just get it by taking the derivative of a position vector with respect to time.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.780
OK, now it's our first time writing this kind of thing with a vector.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:56.720
So the basic rule is you can take the derivative of a vector quantity just by taking the derivatives

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:57.880
of each component.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:06.060
OK, so that's just the x dt, the y dt.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.840
And if you have the component, this is dt.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:38.360
OK, so let's see what it is for the cycloid.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:53.600
So in the example of a cycloid, well, so what do we get when we take the derivative of

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.800
this formula over there?

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:03.660
Well, so the derivative of t is 1 minus cosinty.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.620
The derivative of 1 is 0.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.200
The derivative of minus cosinty is sint.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:12.660
Very good.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.760
That's at least one thing you should remember from single variable calculus.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.520
Hopefully you'll remember even more than that.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.360
OK, so that's the velocity vector.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.320
It tells us at any time how fast we are going in what direction.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:40.260
So for example, observe, remember, last time at the end of class, we were trying to figure out what

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.600
exactly happens near the bottom point.

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.740
You know, when we have this motion that seems to stop and go backwards.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.360
And we answered that one way.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.220
But let's try to understand it in terms of velocity.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.840
What if I plug t equals 0 in here?

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:57.000
Then 1 minus cosinty is 0.

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:57.980
Sinty is 0.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.100
The velocity is 0.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:06.220
So at that time, at that particular time, our point is actually not moving.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:12.020
Of course, it's been moving just before and it starts moving just afterwards.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:16.020
It's just, you know, the instant, at that particular instant, the speed is 0.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:25.060
So that's slightly maybe counter-intuitive thing that something is moving.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.820
And at that time, it's actually stopped.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.580
Now, let's see.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:34.540
So that's a vector.

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:35.680
And it's useful.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.720
But if you want just the usual speed as a number, then what will you do?

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:43.480
Well, you'll just take exactly the magnitude of this vector.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:58.640
So speed, which is the scalar quantity, is going to be just the magnitude of a vector v.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:11.760
So in this case, well, it would be square root of 1 minus cosinty squared plus sin squared

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:12.080
t.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:23.580
And if you expand that, well, so you will get, let me take a bit more space, that's going

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:34.900
to be square root of 1 minus 2 cosinty plus cosint squared t plus sin squared t seems

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:39.860
to simplify a little bit because we have cosint squared plus sin squared, that's 1.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:46.200
So it's going to be square root of 2 minus 2 cosinty.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:54.680
So at this point, if I was going to ask you, when is the speed the smallest of the largest,

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.620
you could answer based on that.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:01.180
See, a t equals 0, well, that turns out to be 0.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.400
The point is not moving.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:07.760
A t equals pi, that ends up being square root of 2 plus 2, which is 4.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:12.900
So that's 2, and that's when you actually add the top of the arch, and that's when

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.020
the point is moving the fastest.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.940
In fact, there, it's moving twice as fast as the wheel, because the wheel is moving to

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:23.640
the right at unit speed, and the point is also rotating, so it's moving to the right at

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:28.760
unit speed relative to the center, so that the two effects add up and give you a speed

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:29.060
of 2.

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:34.120
Anyway, that's the formula we can get.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.440
Now, what about acceleration?

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:57.320
So here, I should warn you that there's a serious discrepancy between the usual, maybe intuitive

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:01.660
notion of acceleration, the one that you are aware of when you drive a car, and the

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:02.440
one that will be using.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.700
So you might think acceleration is just the derivative of speed.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:13.800
If my car goes 55 miles an hour on the highway, then it's going at constant speed, it's

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:14.320
not accelerating.

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:18.880
But let's say that I'm taking a really tight turn, then I'm going to feel something.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.900
There's some force being exerted.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:27.140
And in fact, there is a sideways acceleration at that point, even for the speed is not

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:27.480
changing.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:33.700
So, the definition we'll take of acceleration is as a vector, and the acceleration vector

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.220
is just the derivative of a velocity vector.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:55.100
So, even if speed is constant, that means even if the length of the velocity vector stays

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:58.100
the same, the velocity vector can still rotate.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.100
And as it rotates, that produces acceleration.

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.980
And so this is the notion of acceleration that's relevant in physics.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:12.000
For example, when you write f equals ma, that's really what a, that's the a that you have

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:12.540
in mind here.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:13.060
It's a vector.

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:19.500
Of course, if you're moving in a straight line, then the two notions are the same.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:24.420
Acceleration is also going to be along the line, and it's going to have to do with the

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:25.180
derivative of speed.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.280
But in general, that's not quite the same.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.220
So for example, let's look at the cycloid.

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:41.580
If we take the example of the cycloid, well, what's the derivative of 1 minus cosine

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:41.920
t?

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:44.980
It's sine t.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.200
And what's the derivative of sine t?

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:53.760
Cosine t.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.940
So, the acceleration vector is sine t cosine t.

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:11.800
So in particular, let's look at what happens at time t equals 0 when the point is not

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:12.100
moving.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:18.100
Well, the acceleration vector there will be 0,1.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:33.100
So what that means is that if I look at my trajectory at this point, well, then the acceleration

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:35.840
vector is pointing in that direction.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.000
It's the unit vector in the vertical direction.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:46.160
So, my point is not moving at that particular time, but it's accelerating up.

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:52.260
So that means actually that as it comes down, first it's slowing down, then it stops here,

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.820
and then it reverses going back up.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:02.480
OK, so that's another way to understand what we were saying last time that the trajectory

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.780
at that point has a vertical tangency.

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:11.340
Because that's the direction in which the motion is going to occur just before and just after

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:12.420
time 0.

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:17.940
OK, any questions about that?

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:24.440
No.

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:41.780
OK, so I should insist maybe on one thing, which is that so we can differentiate vectors

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.100
just component by component.

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:51.920
And we can differentiate vector expressions according to certain rules that we'll see

00:14:51.920 --> 00:15:03.840
in a moment, one thing that we cannot do, it's not true that the length of the R dt, which

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:10.260
is the speed, is equal to the length R dt.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:15.520
This is completely false, and they're really not the same.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:23.040
OK, so if you have to differentiate the length of a vector, then basically you're in trouble.

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:28.640
If you really, really want to do it, well, the length of a vector is the square root of the

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:32.860
sums of the squares of the components, and from that you can use formula for the derivative

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:36.780
of the square root and the chain rule and various other things, and you can get there.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.500
But it will not be a very nice expression.

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:43.000
There's no simple formula for this kind of thing.

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:49.280
Fortunately, we almost never have to compute this kind of thing, because after all it's not

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:53.260
very relevant quantity, what's more relevant might be this one.

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:54.320
This is actually the speed.

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:57.640
This one, I don't know what it means in general.

00:15:59.700 --> 00:15:59.840
OK?

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:13.020
So let's continue our exploration.

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:18.220
So the next concept that I want to define is that of arc length.

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:24.840
So arc length is just the distance that you have traveled along the curve.

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:25.660
OK?

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:30.400
So if you're in a curve, it has this mileage counter that tells you how far you've gone,

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:32.420
how much fuel you've used if it's a fancy curve.

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:38.740
And what it does is it actually integrates the speed over time to give you the arc length

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:40.220
along the trajectory of a curve.

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:47.940
So the usual notation that we'll have is S for arc length.

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:54.060
I'm not quite sure how you get an S out of this, but it's the usual notation.

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:56.480
OK?

00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:06.220
So S is the distance traveled along the trajectory.

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:17.020
And for that to make sense, of course, we need to fix a reference point.

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:21.600
Maybe on the cycloid, we'd say it's the distance starting from the origin.

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:25.280
In general, maybe you'll say you start at time equals 0.

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:26.880
But it's a convention.

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:32.580
You could decide if you knew in advance you could have actually your car's mileage counter

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:36.320
to count backwards from the point where the car will die and stop working.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.520
That would be slightly freaky.

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:48.180
But you could have certainly a negative arc length that gets closer and closer to 0

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:50.680
and gets to 0 at the end of the trajectory or anything you want.

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:52.420
I mean, arc length would be positive or negative.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:56.700
Typically, it's negative when you're before the reference point and positive afterwards.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:02.100
So now, how does it relate to the things we've seen there?

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:14.480
Well, so in particular, how do you relate arc length and time?

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:25.080
Well, so there's a simple relation, which is that the rate of change of arc length

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:29.400
there's a time, well, that's going to be the speed at which you're moving.

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:35.720
Because the speed, as a scalar quantity, tells you how much distance you're covering

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:36.460
per unit time.

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:51.160
And in fact, to be completely honest, I should put an absolute value here.

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:56.000
Because there's examples of curves, maybe where your motion is going back and forth

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.900
along the same curve and then you don't want to keep counting arc length all the time.

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:04.520
Actually, maybe you want to say that the arc length increases than decreases along the curve.

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:06.980
I mean, you get to choose how you count it.

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:12.160
But in this case, if you're moving back and forth, it would make more sense to have

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:15.140
the arc length first increase, then decrease, increase again and so on.

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:39.940
So, if you want to know really what the arc length is, then basically the only way to do

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:42.560
it is to integrate speed versus time.

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:49.460
So if you wanted to know how long an arc of cycloid is, you have this nice looking curve,

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:50.820
how long is it?

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:57.160
Well, you'd have to basically integrate this quantity from t equal to 0 to 2 pi.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.000
So how to integrate that.

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:33.780
So we don't actually have a formula for the length at this point.

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:40.660
However, we'll see one later using a cool trick and multivariable calculus.

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:53.420
So for now, we'll just leave a formula like that and we don't know how long it is.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:56.620
Well, you can put that into your calculator and get a numerical value.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.420
But that's the best I can offer.

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:19.520
Now another useful notion is the unit tangent vector to the trajectory.

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:24.540
So the usual notation is t hat.

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:27.600
It has a hat because it's a unit vector and t because it's tangent.

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.260
Now how do we get this unit tangent vector?

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:39.580
So maybe I should have pointed out before that if you're moving along some trajectory,

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:45.260
so you're going in that direction, then when you're at this point, the velocity vector

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:49.360
is going to be tangent to the trajectory.

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:53.600
It tells you the direction of motion in particular.

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:59.000
So if you want a unit vector that goes in the same direction, all you have to do is

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.980
just rescale it so that its length becomes 1.

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:10.120
So it's v divided by magnitude of v.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:36.460
So it seems like now we have a lot of different things that should be related in some way.

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:38.480
So let's see what we can say.

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:48.240
Well, we can say that dR by dt, so that's the velocity vector.

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:57.880
That's the same thing as if I use the chain rule, dR dS times dS dt.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:01.060
Okay?

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:07.080
So let's think about these things.

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:13.780
So this guy here, we've just seen that's the same as the speed.

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:24.080
So this one here should be v divided by its length.

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:29.760
So that means this actually should be the unit tangent vector.

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.640
Okay, so let me rewrite that.

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:36.520
It's t dS dt.

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:44.900
So maybe if I actually stated directly that way, see, I'm just saying the velocity vector has a length

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:51.200
and a direction. The length is the speed. The direction is tangent to the trajectory.

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:23.080
So the speed is dS dt and the tangent vector is t hat.

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:25.880
And that's how we get this.

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:26.620
Okay?

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:34.580
So let's try just to see why dR dS should be t.

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.440
Well, let's think of dR dS.

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:43.300
dR dS means, you know, position vector r means you have the origin, which is somewhere out there.

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.360
And the vector r is here.

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:55.620
So dR dS means we move by a small amount delta s along the trajectory by a certain distance delta s.

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:58.280
And we look at how the position vector changes.

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:04.340
Well, we'll have a small change.

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:12.920
Let me call that vector delta r corresponding to the size, corresponding to the length delta s.

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:14.460
And now,

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:28.400
delta r should be essentially roughly equal to, well, its direction will be tangent to the trajectory.

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:34.040
If I take a small enough interval, then the motion will be almost tangent to the trajectory.

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:40.420
Times the length of it will be delta s, the distance that I have traveled.

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:46.000
Maybe I should, sorry, maybe I should, we explained that on a separate board.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.360
Okay, so let's say that we have an amount of time delta t.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.620
So let's zoom into that curve.

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:05.080
Okay, so we have r at time t.

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:11.660
We have r at time t plus delta t.

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:16.820
This vector here I will call delta r.

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:21.440
The length of this vector is delta s.

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:29.800
And the direction is essentially that of a tangent vector.

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:41.400
So delta s over delta t, that's the amount, that's the distance traveled divided by the time.

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:44.420
That's going to be close to the speed.

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:53.660
And delta r is approximately t times delta s.

00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:03.160
So now if I divide both sides by delta t, I get this.

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:10.120
And if I take the limit as delta t tends to zero, then I get the same formula with derivatives

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:12.440
and with an equality, it's the same approximation.

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:16.220
The approximation becomes better and better if I go to smaller intervals.

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:18.460
Okay.

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:40.080
Okay, are there any questions about this?

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:44.420
Yes?

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:48.960
I said the direction, you would see tangent to the curve.

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:53.860
You said when you're trying to do that, you would see a tangent.

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.340
So it's a tangent.

00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:58.940
Yes, that's correct.

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:01.000
So let's be more careful actually.

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:07.340
So you're asking about whether delta r is actually strictly tangent to the curve.

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:11.560
Is that it seems like if your first time around the other time that I've all incurred,

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:15.160
any other time that comes across, it wouldn't be tangent, but tangent.

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:16.480
That's correct.

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:19.120
Actually, delta r is not strictly tangent to anything.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:21.120
So maybe I should draw another picture.

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:31.940
If I'm going from here to here, then delta r is going to be this arc inside the curve,

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:36.340
while the tangent vector will be going in this direction.

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:38.220
Okay.

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:40.460
So they're not strictly parallel to each other.

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:42.400
And that's why it's only approximately equal.

00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:48.680
Similarly, this distance, the length of delta r is not exactly the length along the curve.

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:49.560
It's actually a bit shorter.

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:53.620
But if you imagine a smaller and smaller portion of the curve,

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:59.980
then this effect of the curve being a curve and not a straight line becomes more and more

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:00.480
negligible.

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:04.500
If you zoom into the curve sufficiently, then it looks more and more like a straight line.

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:07.200
And then what I said becomes true in the limit.

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:08.920
Okay.

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:12.840
Any other questions?

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:19.020
Okay.

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:29.980
So what happens next?

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:40.300
Okay. So let me show you a nice example of why we might want to use vectors

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.100
to study parametric curves.

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:45.780
Because after all a lot of what's here, you can just do in coordinates.

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:47.720
And we don't really need vectors.

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:52.160
Well, actually, vectors being a language, you know, you never strictly need it,

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.300
but it's useful to have an ocean of vectors.

00:29:55.100 --> 00:30:08.240
So I want to tell you a bit about Kepler's second low

00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:12.900
of celestial mechanics.

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:18.460
So that goes back from, that goes back to 16.09.

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:20.680
So that's not exactly recent news, okay.

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:27.140
But still, I think it's a very interesting example of why you might want to use vector

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:28.840
methods to analyze motions.

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:37.240
So what happens, what happens back then is Kepler was trying to observe the motion of planets

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:42.460
in the sky and trying to come up with general explanations of how they move.

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:45.440
Before him, people were saying, well, they kind of move in a circle,

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:47.800
but maybe it's more complicated than that.

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:52.140
We need to add smaller circular motions on top of each other and so on.

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:53.640
They had more and more complicated theories.

00:30:54.300 --> 00:31:00.040
And then Kepler came with these laws that say basically that planets move in an ellipse

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:04.980
around the sun and that they move in a very specific way along that ellipse.

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:08.580
So there's actually three laws, but let me just tell you about the second one,

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:11.140
that has a very nice vector interpretation.

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:19.520
So what Kepler's second law says is that the motion of planets

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:26.380
is, first of all, they move in a plane.

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:31.560
And second, the

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:34.340
area

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:44.080
swept out by the line from the sun to the planet is swept at constant time.

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:55.140
So it's swept at constant rate.

00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:59.120
From the sun to the planet.

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:07.180
The area is swept out by the line at a constant rate.

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:21.700
So that's an interesting law because it tells you

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:27.240
once you know what the orbit of a planet looks like,

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:30.260
it tells you how fast it's going to move on that orbit.

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:10.740
So let me explain again.

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:18.520
So this law says, you know, maybe the sun,

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:22.340
let's put the sun here at the origin.

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:26.580
And let's have a planet.

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:30.800
Well, the planet orbits around the sun

00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:36.980
in some trajectory.

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:42.520
So this is supposed to be light blue.

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:44.020
Can you see it as different from white?

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:46.760
No, okay, mini-veh.

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:52.340
Okay, doesn't really matter.

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:54.180
So the planet moves on its orbit.

00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:58.980
And if you wait for a certain time,

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:02.940
then you know, a bit later it will be here, then here and so on,

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:05.340
then you can look at the amount of area,

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:09.560
you know, inside this triangular wedge.

00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:14.240
And the claim is that the amount of area in here

00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:16.020
is proportional to the time it lapsed.

00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:19.620
So in particular, if the planet is closer to the sun,

00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:20.620
then it has to go faster.

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:22.580
And if it's further away from the sun,

00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:25.860
then it has to go slower so that the area

00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:27.360
remains proportional to time.

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:30.840
So that's a very sophisticated prediction.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.520
And I think the way he came to it was really just

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:38.020
by using a lot of observations and trying to measure

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:40.300
what things, you know, what was true, it wasn't true.

00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:45.360
But let's try to see how we can understand that

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:49.940
in terms of what we know today about mechanics.

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:54.620
So in fact, what happens is that Newton,

00:34:55.220 --> 00:35:00.620
so Newton was quite a bit later, I mean, that was the late 17th century,

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:04.340
instead of beginning of the 17th century.

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:19.260
So he was able to explain this using his laws for

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:21.820
gravitational attraction.

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:40.140
And you'll see that if we reformulate Kepler's law in terms of vectors,

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:43.360
then, and if we work up it with these vectors,

00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:45.080
we're going to end up with something that's actually

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:47.940
in completely obvious to us now.

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:49.460
At the time, it was very far from obvious.

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:50.880
But to us now, it's completely obvious.

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:58.180
So let's try to see what does Kepler's law say in terms of vectors.

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:15.140
Okay.

00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:22.780
So let's think of what kinds of vectors we might want to have in here.

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:32.520
Well, it might be good to think of maybe the position vector.

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:37.440
And maybe it's variation.

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:42.400
So if we wait as to an amount of time, we'll have a vector delta R,

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:47.440
which is the change in position vector of a certain interval of time.

00:36:57.940 --> 00:37:00.060
So let's start with the first step.

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:02.600
What's the most complicated thing in here?

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:04.840
It's this area swept out by the line.

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:08.960
How do we express that area in terms of vectors?

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:12.900
Well, I've almost given the answer by drawing this picture.

00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:16.680
If I take a sufficiently small amount of time,

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:22.080
this graded region looks like a triangle.

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.540
So we have to find the area of the triangle.

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:25.900
Well, we know how to do that now.

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:37.080
So the area is approximately equal to one half of the area of a parallelogram

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:38.600
that I could form from these vectors.

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:44.480
And the area of a parallelogram is given by the magnitude of a cross-product.

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:56.200
Okay. So I should say this is the area swept in time delta T.

00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:59.060
And you should think of delta T as relatively small.

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:02.700
I mean, at the scale of a planet, that might still be a few days,

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:07.520
but small compared to the overall trajectory.

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:15.500
So now, let's remember that the amount they which we moved,

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:21.280
delta R, is approximately equal to V times delta T.

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:28.620
And just using the definition of a velocity vector.

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:35.680
So let's use that.

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:44.260
Well, sorry, so it's again approximately equal to R cross V magnitude times delta T.

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:47.460
I can take out the delta T, which is a scalar.

00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:55.360
So now, what does it mean to say that area is swept at a constant rate?

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:58.380
It means this thing is proportional to delta T.

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:10.680
So that means, so the last says, in fact, that the length of this cross-product R cross V

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:12.500
equals constant.

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:21.700
R cross V has constant length.

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:28.160
Any questions about that?

00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:32.500
No. Yes.

00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:36.340
Yes, let me try to explain that again.

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:43.660
So what I'm claiming is that the length of the cross-product R cross V

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:49.140
measures the rate at which area is swept by the position vector.

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:54.700
I should say, with a factor of two, one half of this length is the rate at which area is swept.

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:55.980
How do we see that?

00:39:56.620 --> 00:40:03.340
Well, let's take a small time interval delta T. In time delta T, our planet moves by V delta T.

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:09.780
So if it moves by V delta T, it means that this triangle up there has two sides.

00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:17.100
One is the position vector R, the other one is V delta T. So it's area is given by one half

00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:22.140
of the magnitude of a cross-product. That's the formula we've seen for the area of the triangle

00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:29.680
in space. So the area is one half of the cross-product R and V delta T.

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:36.140
Magnitude of the cross-product. So to say that the rate at which area is swept is constant

00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:42.120
means that these two are proportional, area divided by delta T is constant over time.

00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:43.500
And so this is constant.

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:51.820
Now what about the other half of the law?

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.380
Well, it says that the motion is no plane.

00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:06.660
And so we have a plane in which the movement takes place

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:12.600
and it contains also the sun and it contains the trajectory.

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:15.580
So let's think about that plane.

00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:23.480
Well, I claim that the position vector is in the plane. That's what we are saying.

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:27.680
But there's another vector that I know is in the plane.

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:31.500
Well, you could say the position vector at another time or at any time.

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:38.220
But in fact, what's also true is that the velocity vector is in the plane.

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:43.660
If I'm moving in a plane, then position and velocity are in there.

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:50.280
So the plane of motion contains R and V.

00:41:55.640 --> 00:42:00.980
So what's the direction of the cross-product R cross V?

00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:05.180
Well, it's the direction that's perpendicular to this plane.

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:16.340
So it's normal to the plane of motion.

00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:26.780
And that means now that actually we've put the two statements in there

00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:32.640
into a single form because we are saying R cross V has constant length and constant direction.

00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:39.100
In fact, in general, maybe I should say something about this.

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:45.200
So if you just look at the position vector and the velocity vector for any motion at any given time,

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:48.000
then together we determine some plane.

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:53.220
And that's the plane that contains the origin, the point, and the velocity vector.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.180
If you want it's the plane in which the motion seems to be going at the given time.

00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:02.800
Now, of course, if your motion is not in a plane, then that plane will change.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.700
It's somehow the instant, you know, the plane in which the motion is taking place at the given time.

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:11.520
And to say that the motion actually stays in that plane, however,

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:14.420
means that this guy will not change direction.

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:18.960
Okay, so...

00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:51.960
So Kepler's second law is actually equivalent to saying that R cross V equals constant, equals a constant vector.

00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:56.300
Okay, that's what the law says.

00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:10.240
So in terms of derivatives, it means d by dt of R cross V is the zero vector.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.400
Okay, now...

00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:23.080
So there's an interesting thing to know, which is that we can use the usual product rule for

00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:27.180
derivatives with vector expressions, with dot products or cross products.

00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:32.560
There's only one catch, which is that when we differentiate a cross product,

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:37.940
we have to be careful that the guy on the left stays on the left, the guy on the right stays on the right.

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:45.320
Okay, so if you know uv prime equals u prime v plus uv prime, then you're safe.

00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:48.180
If you know it as u prime v plus v prime u, then you're not safe.

00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:51.280
Okay, so that's the only thing to watch for.

00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:53.760
So...

00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:06.320
Product rule is okay for taking the derivative of a dot product,

00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:10.000
where you don't actually even need to be very careful about

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:17.440
or their own things or derivative of a cross product, where you just need to be a little bit more careful.

00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:34.320
Okay, so now that we know that, we can write this as dr dt cross V plus r cross dv dt.

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:38.140
Okay.

00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:42.980
Well, let's reformulate things slightly.

00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:50.700
So dr dt already has a name, in fact, that's V. Okay, that's what we call the velocity vector.

00:45:51.400 --> 00:46:01.160
So this is V cross V plus r cross, what is dv dt? That's the acceleration, a equals zero.

00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:09.820
Okay, so now what's the next step?

00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:16.440
Well, we know what V cross V is, because remember a vector of cross itself is always zero.

00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:20.240
Okay, so...

00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:32.620
So this is the same as r cross a equals zero, and that's the same as saying that,

00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:38.060
you know, the cross product of two vectors is zero exactly when the parallelogram that we form

00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:43.520
has no area. And the way in which that happens is if they're actually parallel to each other.

00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:51.980
So that means the acceleration is parallel to the position. Okay, so in fact what Kepler's

00:46:54.640 --> 00:47:01.400
second law says is that the acceleration is parallel to the position vector.

00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:07.380
And since we know that acceleration is caused by a force, that's equivalent to the fact that

00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:18.160
the gravitational force is parallel to the position vector. That means, well, you know,

00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:24.680
if you have a Sun here at the origin. And if you have your planet, well, the gravitational

00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:33.220
force caused by the Sun should go along this line. And thanks a lot, doesn't even say

00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:37.360
we're going towards the Sun or away from the Sun. Well, what we know now is that, of course,

00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:42.400
the attraction is towards the Sun. But Kepler's law would also be true, actually, if things were

00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:48.400
going away. So in particular, say, electric force also has this property of being towards the

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:54.140
central charge. So actually, if you look at motion of charged particles in an electric field,

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:59.380
caused by a point charged particle, it also satisfies Kepler's law. Satisfies the same law.

00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:02.540
Okay, that's the end for today. Thanks.
