00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.800
Okay, so let's continue with our discussion about continuous functions.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.720
Let's first let me recall a few facts.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.020
Well, this is not a definition, but this was a theorem we proved last time.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.280
So I won't recall the definition of continuity, but we proved this theorem

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:49.620
characterizing continuity. And if we have a subset of r, an element in s, and a function,

00:00:49.620 --> 00:01:08.280
s going from s to r, then f is continuous at c, if and only if for every sequence,

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:27.300
x sub n, of elements of s, such that x n converges to c, we have limit as n goes to infinity,

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:38.180
f of c, so this was a theorem we proved last time. And let me recall an older theorem,

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:46.480
which I said was very powerful, but never really gave you any sort of powerful application,

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.880
which will start giving some powerful applications now, but this was the Balsano

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:13.900
Virostross theorem, which states that every bounded sequence of real numbers has a convergent sub sequence.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:32.040
And we're going to use these two theorems today, and in the next lecture,

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:40.820
to prove that a continuous function on a closed and bounded interval is very well behaved.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:54.540
So what we're going to show, let's call it the theme, is that

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:19.500
f from a closed and bounded interval is continuous, meaning it's continuous at every point.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:37.860
And then it is well behaved. And for example, the first thing that we're going to prove,

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:56.200
which will be a combination of two theorems, is that the image of a closed and bounded interval by a continuous function is another closed and bounded interval.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:04.800
And e could equal d, so this could just be a single point, for example, if f is a constant function, then the image would just be a single point.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.000
So this is a theme of this lecture and the next lecture.

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:31.620
And so let's start, basically, we're going to prove two theorems, one is called the min max theorem, and the other is called Balsano's intermediate value theorem.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:40.020
The min max theorem will tell you that f of an interval is always contained in an interval of this type.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:48.820
And then the intermediate value theorem will tell you everything in between two certain bounds is attained by f.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:58.900
So let's start off with showing that f of a closed and bounded interval is a bounded set.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.620
So let me just recall what it means for a function to be bounded.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:10.580
We say that a function from a subset s to r is bounded, so here s is a subset of r.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:28.200
It is bounded if there exists a non-negative b such that for all x and s, f of x is bigger than or equal to b.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:51.280
So for example, if I take f of x to be 3x plus 1 and here s is the closed and bounded interval 0, 1, then f is bounded.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:05.920
So pictorially, what does this mean? Well, f of x equals 3x plus 1, so at 1 it's going to be 4.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:14.980
And pictorially, a function is bounded if the graph is always bounded between two real numbers.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:22.800
And for us, for f of x it's always bounded between 0 and 4 in terms of this absolute value.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:36.280
So f of x equals 3x plus 1. This is less than or equal to by the triangle inequality three times the absolute value of x plus 1.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.680
x is between 0 and 1, so it's absolute values bounded by 1.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.840
So this function is bounded.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:58.260
And so how about a function which is not bounded? What does that mean?

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:05.160
Remember whenever we see definition, we should try to negate it to understand it better.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:19.940
So f is unbounded if we're all b bigger than or equal to 0.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:32.600
There exists some bad x such that f of x an absolute value is bigger than or equal to b.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:51.160
So if a bounded function is supposed to have a graph bounded between two real numbers, an unbounded one is one in which at least part of the graph is going off to plus infinity or minus infinity.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:08:14.840
So kind of most basic example we could think of is let's say if we wanted to go from 0, 1 to r again we could take f of x to be 0 at x equals 0, 1 over x if x is not equal to 0.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:34.840
So this function looks like 1, 1, and goes up to infinity as you approach x equals 0.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:38.420
So why is this unbounded? We have to verify the negation of the definition.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:44.720
So I claim f is unbounded.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:55.480
Let b be bigger than or equal to 0. We now have to find an x in 0, 1 so that 1 over x or so that f of x is bigger than b.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:09:16.460
And this is pretty easy. So let x be in r such that 1 over x is bigger than b.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:30.740
So if b is equal to 0, we take x to be anything in 0, 1 that's fair enough.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:42.060
So if x is 1 over b, so if we like we could make this explicit.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.420
So I'll just keep it here.

00:09:54.380 --> 00:10:01.240
And so now if we take x here and look at the graph it's going to be bigger than b.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:14.320
And that's it.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:23.600
OK.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:37.360
OK, so several of these proofs will have the same flavor.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:41.920
I hope what we're going to try and prove.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:50.780
And this one is a nice one to start off with and necessary.

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:58.860
So my first theorem that I want to prove about continuous functions on a bounded interval,

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:02.280
closed and bounded interval is that they're bounded.

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:20.640
So if I have a function from a b to r is continuous, meaning it's continuous at every point in a b,

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.900
then f is bounded.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:43.000
So the proof of this theorem and several of these theorems will be by contradiction.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:53.460
And the fact that we're on a closed and bounded interval is, or that we're in the setting,

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:55.880
is what allows us to use balls on a wire straw.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.280
This is this powerful too.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:03.520
So this is so assume.

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:24.140
And so like I said, this proof is by contradiction that the conclusion is false.

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.720
Which the precise meaning is right here.

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.680
For all b there exists an x and s such that that.

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:47.200
So for every b I can find an x and s so that the absolute value of f of x is bigger than or equal to b.

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:57.000
So I could take b to be n, for example, where n is a natural number.

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:03.300
Then we're all in a natural number.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:18.780
So I'm taking b to be n. There exists x sub n in a b such that f of x sub n and absolute value is bigger than or equal to n.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:27.800
So now I have this sequence which is bounded because it's in this closed and bounded interval.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:43.320
So x is bounded because it's in this closed and bounded interval a b.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:14:13.300
So by balls on a wire straws, there exists a sub sequence x in sub k of the sequence x sub n and x in r such that limit as k goes to infinity of x of n sub k.

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:24.580
Now I claim that this x is actually in the interval a b.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:35.980
Since x sub n sub k is a sub sequence of x sub n which are in a sub b or a comma b.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:47.200
So I have for all k x sub n sub k is between a and b.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:52.260
This implies by what we know about limits that limits respect inequalities.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:15:05.760
Therefore a less than or equal to limit s k goes to infinity of x of n sub k which is less than or equal to b.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:14.680
This is x. So i.e. x is between a and b.

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:30.680
Another way, instead of going through this, is, I believe we did in the assignment that an interval of this form is closed.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:48.680
You prove that for a closed set, so when I say an interval of this form is closed, I mean it's a closed set and you proved on the assignment that for a closed set, if I have a convergent sequence, then the limit of that sequence has to belong to the set.

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:57.000
So this is really a consequence of the fact that this interval is a closed set.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.100
So I have this sub sequence.

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:15.080
X of n sub k is converging to x which is in a b.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:23.680
So let's look at f of x.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:52.980
Since f is continuous and the x sub n sub k is converged to x, as k goes to infinity, I know by the theorem of top over there.

00:16:52.980 --> 00:17:01.040
That f of x equals the limit of f of x sub x sub n sub k.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:12.020
And therefore, f of value of x is equal to the limit as k goes to infinity of the f of values.

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:21.220
But now, f of x sub n is always bigger than or equal to n.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:31.980
That's how the x sub n's were chosen. We assume that f is unbounded and therefore all of these x sub n's and a b were chosen so that f of x sub n is bigger than or equal to n.

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.300
So this is bigger than or equal to.

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:56.020
So each of these is bigger than or equal to n sub k.

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:03.600
Let's see how to write this without.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:19.580
I don't want to write the limit of something equals infinity because we haven't said what it means for the limit of something to equal infinity.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:40.580
So then the limit as k goes to infinity of f of x sub n sub k exists, which implies that the sequence is bounded.

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:44.320
A convergent sequence is always bounded.

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:54.440
And since n sub k is always less than or equal to f of x sub k.

00:18:55.140 --> 00:19:05.160
And this is a bounded sequence. This tells me that the sequence n sub k is bounded.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:14.860
But this is impossible. Remember, the form of sub sequence, the n sub k's are increasing integers, which is a contradiction.

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:20.820
And this is always because n sub 1 is always less than n sub 2 is less than 3 and so on.

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.120
So these are always getting bigger without bound.

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:29.860
And therefore, we have our contradiction.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.740
So again, here's the structure of the proof.

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:38.780
We have, we want to assume some property of f.

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:46.640
So we assume not, we get this kind of bad sequence of numbers in this interval.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:52.820
And using boson of iraustross, we get to pass to some sort of limit x.

00:19:53.580 --> 00:20:02.380
And the continuity of f at x essentially breaks the badness of the sequence x sub n.

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:08.860
Okay, well, we'll see another argument where it's kind of the same flavor.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.820
So, we'll assume state that f always achieves kind of a maximum value and minimum value.

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:27.380
So let me first on the close and bounded intervals.

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:32.400
So let me precisely define what these absolute min's and absolute maxes are.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:39.840
So let f be a function from s to r, s is a non-empty subset of r.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:53.280
We say f achieves, f achieves an absolute max.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.680
Let me write it this way.

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:12.460
An absolute min at c and s if f of c sits below f of x for all x and s.

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:21.900
If we're all x and s, f of c is less than or equal to f of x.

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:46.520
Okay, so this is an absolute min f achieves absolute max at d and s.

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:53.460
If f of d sits above everything, every x he's sticking to f.

00:21:53.620 --> 00:22:01.240
If for all x and s, f of x is less than or equal to f of d.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:12.000
So, for example, so what's the picture that goes with this?

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.400
Let's imagine we're on a close and bounded interval.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.200
Then, d.

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:41.120
So, f achieves absolute max at d.

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:54.920
The graph of f sits below the value f of d and sits above the value f of c.

00:22:56.660 --> 00:23:08.180
Now, absolute max and min's at points are so that the function is always sitting above f evaluated at that point.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:12.640
Just a quick warning.

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:25.620
Let's say we're looking at, all right, so this is not to scale, but let's say our function looks like this.

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:42.500
So, this is 1, 2, 3 halves.

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:46.760
Then this function does not have an absolute max.

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:53.600
It does not achieve an absolute max or achieve an absolute min on the set 1, 2.

00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:02.100
What you would like to say is that 1, that f achieves an absolute min at 1.

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:07.960
But the graph does not sit above f evaluated at 1.

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:14.720
Just like over here, the graph of f does not sit below f evaluated at 2.

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:24.460
Absolute f achieves an absolute min at a point if the whole graph sits above f evaluated at that point.

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:28.400
Not necessarily some number sits below the whole graph.

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:29.760
That's what boundedness means.

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:43.180
So, I just want to clarify that distinction between the graph of a function being bounded below by a number and f achieving a min at a certain point.

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:52.900
So, for example, the graph of this function is bounded below by 1, but f does not achieve an absolute min at c equals 1.

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:24.560
So, our next theorem is the min max theorem for continuous functions, which is the following.

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:50.560
The f b function from a b to r, if f is continuous, meaning it's continuous at every point in a b, then f achieves.

00:25:54.560 --> 00:26:05.420
Absolute min and absolute max on a b.

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:33.900
So, another way of stating this, so let's just make this a mark, says that there exists c, d, and a b such that f of a b is contained in f of c, f of d.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:55.300
So, we'll do the proof of an absolute max and the proof of the absolute min I'll leave to you.

00:26:56.420 --> 00:27:02.660
It's a simple kind of change in the argument that's not too difficult.

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:16.740
And again, we're going to use this powerful tool, bosono-virus truss, that allows us to go from kind of an arbitrary sequence in a b to a convergent subsequence.

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:37.860
So, let me write it this way, if this function is continuous, then by what we've proven where?

00:27:37.860 --> 00:28:02.620
Over there, this implies f is bounded, then the set e given by the range of f, so f of x, where x is in a b.

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:19.840
This set is bounded above, right? If the absolute value of f of x is always less than or equal to some b, then f of x is always bounded above by b for all x and a b, so this set is bounded above.

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:37.060
Now, let l be the supremum of e, which exists because the real numbers have the least upper bound property.

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:42.700
Whenever we have a non-empty subset which is bounded above, we can always find a supremum.

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:50.240
Now, since l is a supremum of this set, we did this, I think, in an assignment.

00:28:52.340 --> 00:29:05.080
Yes, I definitely did an assignment. Then, there exists a sequence of elements of this set e converging to l.

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:18.480
And to express that, that means there exists some sequence of elements, so there exists a sequence of the form f of x sub n, such that,

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:27.200
limit as n goes to infinity of f of x sub n equals l.

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:37.780
Now, we would like to show that l is equal to f of d for some number d.

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:52.220
And how we are going to do that is, well, this is the x of n's, or just some sequence in a b, so we can pass to a sub sequence, which converges to some number, call it d.

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:58.000
And then, we need to show that f of d equals l, and that's where we use continuity. And then, that's the whole proof.

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:11.060
Which, you know, we saw a little bit over here. We passed to a sub sequence, and then we get to say that the limit of this sub sequence has kind of the same property as the original sequence.

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:32.580
So, by Pozano-Vierstras, there exists a sub sequence x sub n sub k, so this is a sub sequence of the sequence x sub n,

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:51.880
and as before, the same argument, you know, and limit d, but as before d will be in the set a b.

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:07.540
Such that limit as k goes to infinity of x of n sub k equals d.

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:25.380
So, we use Pozano-Vierstras, pass to a sub sequence of the x of n's, and a convergent sub sequence, and so all of these x of n sub k's are between a and b, so their limit d will be between a and b.

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:46.560
But now, since f is continuous at d, it's continuous at every point in a b, so it's certainly continuous at d, f of d.

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:56.480
This is equal to the limit as k goes to infinity of f of x of n sub k, since the x of n sub k's are converging to d.

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:11.320
And now, f of x of n sub k, this is also a sub sequence of the sequence f of x of n, and f of x of n is a convergent sequence, so any sub sequence has to converge to the same thing.

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:37.440
Since f of x of n converges to l, and f of n sub k is a sub sequence of f of x of n.

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:45.020
And remember, what was l? l was the super v.

00:32:55.320 --> 00:33:12.020
And therefore, for all x and a b, f of x is less than or equal to f of d, which means f achieves an absolute max at d.

00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:16.540
And absolute min is similar.

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:26.860
And I'll leave it to you.

00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:39.860
So just re-running through the proof.

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:50.700
We did use the fact that a continuous function is bounded, and we extracted the soup, if you like, of the range of f.

00:33:52.740 --> 00:34:01.940
And so, which is by this exercise we did in one of the assignments, means that this supremum is equal to the limit of f of x of n's.

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:14.960
We would like to show l is equal to f of d for some d. So we passed a sub sequence of the x of n's that does converge to something in the interval a b, and we can show using the continuity of f.

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:26.360
And how this original sequence was chosen, that f at that point is actually equal to the supremum of that set.

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:29.940
And therefore, f achieves an absolute max at that set.

00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:53.140
As beginning students of math, one of the things we should be curious about is, you know, what hypotheses are needed and what are not in the statements of theorems.

00:34:53.140 --> 00:35:07.060
So our main hypothesis, so we had two hypotheses really in the theorem that f is going from this closed and bounded interval to r, and that f is continuous.

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:14.460
So what happens if we drop one of those hypotheses is the conclusion still true that f achieves an absolute max and absolute min.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:26.000
So this example that I drew right here shows that we need to have the function be continuous in order for it to achieve an absolute max and absolute min on the closed and bounded interval.

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:38.880
But it also needs to be on a closed and bounded interval.

00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:12.220
So we have some continuous function from s to r. Can we drop the assumption that s is equal to this closed and bounded interval, meaning could it be say an open interval does the same conclusion whole.

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:54.640
And the answer is no.

00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:02.120
So what does this guy look like?

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:28.000
Here's zero.

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:30.500
There's one half.

00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:49.440
Okay, so this function does not achieve a absolute min or absolute max. But it is continuous on this interval. But because the intervals not closed and bounded, this function does not achieve an absolute min or absolute max.

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:58.840
So what I'm trying to say is that the assumptions that two, so there's two assumptions here that we're working on a closed and bounded interval and that f is continuous.

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:01.880
These two assumptions are necessary for the theorem to be true.

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:16.640
Now they are not the most precise way of stating this theorem. You could replace a closed and bounded interval with what's called a compact set, which maybe I'll put in the assignment or on the midterm.

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:34.360
Depending on where there's room. But just in the setting of intervals, the interval has to be closed and bounded and the function has to be continuous for this theorem to hold true.

00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:41.360
So that's what I wanted to get at.

00:38:54.280 --> 00:39:07.700
So what we've proven, as I said in this remark here, is that there exists two numbers C and D and a B.

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:18.760
So that f of A, B is contained in F of C, F of D. C would be where F achieves an absolute min. D would be where F of A achieves an absolute max.

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:30.520
And this is absolute max.

00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:41.880
So now the question becomes, do I hit everything in between? Does this inclusion become equality?

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:49.880
And I gave the game away at the beginning of the lecture by saying yes it will, but that's actually a theorem.

00:39:52.940 --> 00:40:00.720
So this was the min max theorem, which I didn't call it that. I should have, it's actually called that in the notes.

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:09.320
But now we're going to move on to the intermediate value theorem. And first we're going to do what looks like a special case.

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:14.420
And then we'll prove the general case.

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:27.220
So this theorem, which I'm actually, it's not called this.

00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:38.400
In the textbook, but I'm going to call it this, which I'll call the bisection method, is the following.

00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:55.960
Let f be function from A, B to R. If f of A is less than zero.

00:40:57.100 --> 00:41:00.160
And so, one more.

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:12.260
Be continuous. So we're always in the continuous setting for this section.

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:38.580
So if f of A is less than zero, and f of B is bigger than zero, then there exists C in the interval A, B, such that f of C equals zero.

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:50.840
Okay, so the picture that goes along with this is here's A, B, here's f of A, f of B is positive.

00:41:51.960 --> 00:42:01.920
And therefore, if it's continuous and you believe the definition of continuity is the fact that is that I don't have to pick up my piece of chalk.

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:16.880
It pains me to say this, but that's again not the official definition, but when you keep in your head, since somebody probably told you that at some point, if I don't have to pick up my piece of chalk, then eventually I have to cross the x-axis.

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:20.860
And therefore, at this point, C, f of C will be zero.

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:25.900
Okay, now why do I call this theorem the bisection method?

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:35.080
As we'll see, the way you determine this C is by what in calculus books call the bisection method.

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:36.020
All right?

00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:50.300
Okay, so for the proof,

00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:03.360
we're going to define a sequence of numbers A and B in with special properties.

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:05.880
So I'm first going to tell you what A1 and B1 are.

00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:10.540
A1 is just going to be A. B1 is going to be B.

00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:11.720
Okay?

00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:21.860
And so now I'm going to tell you how to choose the next element in the sequence, knowing the element in the sequence before.

00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:25.560
Okay, so we're going to...

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:43.460
First to find two sequences, A, N, and B.

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:45.780
So let me tell you how to do that.

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:53.580
And the way we're going to choose this is so that f of A sub n is always less than zero, and f of B sub n is always bigger than or equal to zero.

00:43:55.420 --> 00:44:03.780
And they're obtained from the previous two guys by taking the midpoint, so bisecting the ones before.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:11.580
So to get this started, A1 will be just A. B1 will be B.

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:13.200
Okay?

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:20.260
Now for in a natural number, we're going to define...

00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:26.180
So we know A1, so now I'm going to tell you how to define A2 based on now, you know, A1.

00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:32.140
But what I'm about to write down will also tell you how to define A3 since you now know how to do A2.

00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:33.380
So I'm going to write it this way.

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:52.740
For in a natural number, knowing A sub n, B sub n, we define A sub n plus 1, and B sub n plus 1 as follows.

00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:21.800
So if f of A sub n plus B sub n, so the midpoint between the two guys that I already know, so if you like, take in to be 1 for when you first read how to define A sub 2, say.

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:24.980
But what I'm writing down applies to every n.

00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:43.340
So we take f of A sub n plus B sub n over 2 to be, if this is bigger than or equal to 0, then we define A sub n plus 1 to be A sub n.

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:52.300
And B sub n plus 1 to be the midpoint.

00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:10.240
And if of the midpoint is less than 0, then A sub n plus 1 is going to be the midpoint.

00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:18.180
And B sub n plus 1 will be the previous point.

00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:24.960
So let me, in fact, so this is how you define the sequence in general.

00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:27.940
Let's walk through what this means just for n equals 2.

00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:34.140
So that you see, you get the idea. Maybe I should have done this first.

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:43.040
So let's draw a picture to go back.

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:52.360
I don't need this axis. I'll just be so and this is A sub 1.

00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:54.220
This is B sub 1.

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:56.900
And then we look at the midpoint.

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:09.060
So we know that F of A sub 1 is less than 0.

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:17.300
F of B sub 1 is bigger than 0, which is certainly bigger than or equal to 0 if it's bigger than 0.

00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:27.740
Now we look at the midpoint. And based on the sign of this guy, we'll be how we define A 2 and B 2.

00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:36.920
So for the sake of me going through this, let's suppose that F of this thing is less than 0.

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:51.500
Then I take A 2 will be A 1 plus B 1 over 2. And B 2 will be B 1.

00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:54.400
And now I look at the midpoint of these two guys.

00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:59.580
So now I'm at this stage. F of A 2 is less than 0.

00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:02.860
F of B 2 is bigger than 0.

00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:08.120
So I'm in the picture before except now I'm at half the distance between the two endpoints.

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:12.020
And so I look at this point now.

00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:16.880
A 2 plus B 2 over 2.

00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:23.780
And I look at the sign of that. And let's suppose F of this thing is bigger than or equal to 0.

00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:35.500
Then I will take this point to be A 3. And this point will now be B 3.

00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:44.680
And what I have is F of A 3 is less than 0. F of B 3 is bigger than or equal to 0.

00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:53.440
So the point is that the left end point is always negative when I stick it into F.

00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:57.180
The right end point is always non-negative when I stick it into F.

00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:04.700
And that the distance between the two midpoints is always getting cut in half by the previous distance before.

00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:13.720
But we're always in the picture kind of in the setting we were in the step before.

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:32.960
Okay. Now we have three properties of the sequence of A ends and B ends.

00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:40.960
Okay. So for all end, they're always bounded between the original two endpoints.

00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:47.820
Not only that, the A sub ends are always moving to the right.

00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:57.780
Remember, A sub n is always getting replaced by the midpoint between A and A sub n and B sub n.

00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:00.460
Okay. Possibly. Or it's staying the same.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:04.800
So A sub n is always less than or equal to A sub n plus 1.

00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:15.620
Okay. So in fact, let me write it this way.

00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:21.560
We always have A sub n is less than or equal to B sub n.

00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:31.620
We always have A is less than or equal to A in plus 1, which is less than or equal to A in.

00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:44.360
And then we also have, so for all end, B.

00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:48.360
All right. I'm making a mess of what I'm writing down.

00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:52.360
So let's start this over. So the first property I want to write.

00:50:53.540 --> 00:51:01.960
For all end and natural numbers, we have B.

00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:11.140
A sub n is always less than or equal to A sub n plus 1.

00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:17.780
Right. And B sub n plus 1, remember,

00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:27.320
we're whenever, if we're going to change B, it's always to change it to the midpoint between the previous guy and the A from the previous step.

00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:29.500
So this is always less than or equal to B sub n.

00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:48.180
Okay. And now two. If I look at the difference,

00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:56.680
this is always equal to half of the previous distance, right.

00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:02.040
Because either one of these are getting changed to the midpoint.

00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:11.840
So if it's A sub n plus 1, then B sub n plus 1 minus A sub n plus 1 is B sub n minus A sub n plus B sub n over 2, which gives me this.

00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:16.240
Okay. Three.

00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:27.700
We're all in a natural number. And this is just based on how we are choosing.

00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:32.420
We are doing this construction. F of A sub n is less than 0.

00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:38.460
And F of B sub n is bigger than or equal to 0.

00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:42.380
Okay. So I hope this is clear.

00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:48.820
You know, all of these, if you like, you could prove by induction.

00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:51.600
All right. For n equals 1, this is certainly true.

00:52:54.180 --> 00:53:00.220
Assume it holds for n equals m and then prove all of these statements here for n equals n plus 1.

00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:07.980
Okay. But I'm just stating it as clear from the construction.

00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:11.600
And hopefully it is. Okay.

00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:28.620
So what does this give us? Well, by 1, the sequence is A sub n and B sub n are

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:32.800
bounded because they're always bounded between A and B.

00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:45.760
Monotone sequences. Right. A sub n is increasing. B sub n is decreasing.

00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:57.180
All right. Thus, there exists limits.

00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:03.580
So I'm going to call them C and D, but it has nothing to do with the C and D from over here.

00:54:03.580 --> 00:54:30.860
Thus, there exists a sub n equals C.

00:54:30.860 --> 00:54:37.440
So B, again, the A sub n's and B sub n's are between A and B, so their limits will also be between A and B.

00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:46.400
B sub n equals D. Okay.

00:54:55.060 --> 00:55:02.060
Now, I claim C equals D. Why should this not come as a surprise? Well, the A and B's are getting very close.

00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:06.880
They're always, you know, the distance between any two of them is always getting halfed. Right.

00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:30.040
Now, A sub n minus B sub n, this equals A sub n minus 1 minus B sub n minus 2 over 2, which equals 1 over 2 squared, A sub n minus 2 minus B sub n minus 2,

00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:47.480
dot, dot, dot. And therefore, this equals 1 over 2 in minus 1, B sub 1 minus A sub 1 equals 1 over 2 to the n minus 1, B minus A.

00:55:47.480 --> 00:56:14.100
Okay. And therefore, C minus D, which is equal to the limit as n goes to infinity of A sub n minus B sub n equals the limit as n goes to infinity of 1 over 2 to the n minus 1, B minus A.

00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:25.900
1 over 2 to the n minus 1 is converging to 0 times this fixed number, B minus A equals 0. And therefore, these two numbers, these two limits, C and D, equal each other.

00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:53.600
Okay. So, this step here is by the second property here. And now we're essentially done using the third property by 3 and continuity.

00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:14.660
I look at F of C since the A sub n's are converging to C. This is equal to, and F of A sub n is always less than 0. So, its limit is less than or equal to 0.

00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:33.820
And now remember, C is also equal to the limit of the B sub n's. And therefore, by continuity, F of C is equal to F of B sub n. And the F of B sub n's are always not negative.

00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:48.020
So, their limit is also bigger than or equal to 0. So, I've shown that this number, F of C is less than or equal to 0. And then it's also bigger than or equal to 0. And therefore, F of C equals 0.

00:57:50.760 --> 00:58:14.120
Okay. So, we use the, why I put the bisection method here is because we used the bisection method to prove this theorem, which looks like a kind of a special case of,

00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:36.580
of a certain intermediate value property meaning that I can always find something that if I have that I can always find something in the interval that achieves something in between F of A and F of B. In this case, it's just 0. But I can in fact upgrade this.

00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:49.620
This is the following theorem to, to, to, to, bolzano. So, a, bolzano's intermediate value theorem.

00:58:57.640 --> 00:59:02.300
Let F from A to B are B continuous.

00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:28.640
If, if, why is between F of B. So, meaning let's say, so we're in one of two cases. Let's say F of A is less than F of B. If Y is between F of A and F of B.

00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:58.040
Then, there exists a C and A B such that F of C equals Y. If F of A is say bigger than F of B and we take something in between, the same conclusion holds.

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:20.240
So, in short, if I take anything between the value of the function at evaluated at the two end points A and B. Then the function achieves that value at some point.

01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:47.320
So, if I take any Y between here, F has to cross this, a horizontal line and it's achieved at some point C.

01:00:51.400 --> 01:01:05.960
And we'll deduce this from, so this, you know, looks like a special case of this intermediate value theorem if F of A is less than 0, F of B is bigger than 0 and Y is equal to 0.

01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:28.780
But, in fact, you can reduce this general statement to that special case just by a simple trick. So, proof, suppose F of A is less than F of B. So, we're in this first case and Y is in F of A, F of B.

01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:46.780
Let's G of X be F of X minus Y. This is not a function of X and Y. Y is a fixed number between F of A and F of B.

01:01:49.280 --> 01:02:06.700
And this is a function going from A to B to R and which is continuous. So, sum of two continuous functions is continuous, F is a continuous function by assumption.

01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:10.980
This is just a constant minus Y, so there's some is also continuous.

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:29.160
But now, if we look at G of A, this is equal to F of A minus Y. Now, Y is bigger than F of A since Y is an F of A, F of B. So, this is less than 0.

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:59.140
And G of B is equal to F of B minus Y is bigger than 0. And therefore, by the previous theorem, there exists a C and A of B such that G of C equals 0, which means I of C equals 0.

01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:16.220
And the proof assuming F of A is bigger than F of B is similar, you just now put Y here minus F of X. Now, you define G of X to be Y minus F of X.

01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:29.920
So, let me just make a remark about that. It is similar.

01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:45.500
Look at G of X equals Y minus F of X.

01:03:52.400 --> 01:04:15.180
So, Volzano's intermediate value theorem tells us that if I take any value between the function evaluated at the two endpoints, then that value is achieved by something.

01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:30.320
So, this is a simple theorem from this.

01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:44.380
Let's continue this.

01:04:46.260 --> 01:05:11.880
If F local min and C, not local, absolute min and absolute max.

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:32.400
So, if F is equal to F of D, then the image by F of A is equal to F of C, F of D.

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:53.000
And what's the proof? Well, apply Volzano's intermediate value theorem to F now going from the possibly smaller interval C, D.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:06:06.900
So, if F is equal to C, it could be D C or C D, depending on if the thing that I have to stick into F to get the min and the thing I have to stick into F to get the max is smaller than the other.

01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:20.640
So, apply the Volzano's intermediate value theorem to this function now just restricted to this smaller closed interval.

01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:24.540
It's still continuous. And that's the proof.

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:41.160
So, maybe I was a little too fast with that.

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:47.640
So, let me just say a couple of more words about this.

01:06:55.580 --> 01:07:11.780
So, this tells me that everything between the two values, F of C, and F of D is achieved by F on this interval.

01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:31.660
But this is a possibly smaller interval than A B. So, this is contained in the range of F now of this larger interval.

01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:54.900
And since we already know that F of A B is contained in F of C, F of D, and now we've proven the reverse inclusion, this implies that F of C, F of D equals F of A B, and that's the proof.

01:07:57.420 --> 01:08:11.520
Okay. So, I think we'll stop there. Next time, we'll finish with a few remarks about kind of an application of the intermediate value theorem.

01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:15.520
And then we'll move on to uniform continuity.
