00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.680
OK, so so far we've learned about partial derivatives

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.600
and how to use them to find minima and maxima

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.760
of functions of two variables or several variables.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.900
And now we are trying to study more in detail

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.580
how functions of several variables behave,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.760
how to compute their variations, how to estimate

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.420
their variation in arbitrary directions.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.560
And so far, we're going to need some more tools,

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.080
actually, to study these things.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:01:00.480
So more tools to study functions.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.420
So today's topic is going to be differentials.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.480
And just to motivate that, let me remind you about one trick

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.460
that you probably know from single-viable calculus,

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.520
namely implicit differentiation.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.180
So let's say that you have a function y equals f of x.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:04.580
Then you would sometimes write dy equals f prime of x times dx.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.020
And then maybe you would, excuse me,

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.660
can you please take a seat and sit down?

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.300
That would be better.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.820
Thank you.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.920
So we use implicit differentiation to actually relate

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.580
infinitesimals changes in y with infinitesimals changes in x.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.840
And one thing we can do with that, for example,

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.080
is actually figure out the rate of change dy by dx,

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.080
but also the reciprocal dx by dy.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:55.880
And so for example, let's say that we have y equals inverse

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.920
sine of x.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.280
Then we can write x equals sine of y.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.280
And from there, we can actually find out

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.320
what is the derivative of this function.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.960
If we didn't know the answer already,

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.440
by writing dx equals cosine y dy.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:25.020
And so that tells us that dy of dx is going

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.540
to be one over cosine y.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.220
And now cosine, for relation to sine,

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.340
is basically one over square root of 1 minus x squared.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.080
And that's how you find the formula for the derivative

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.480
of the inverse sine function.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.220
From you know that probably you already knew,

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.940
but that's one way to derive it.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.360
So now we are going to use also these kinds of notations,

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.180
dx, dy, and so on, but use them for functions

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.100
of several variables.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.980
And of course, we'll have to learn what are the rules

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.700
of manipulation and what we can do with them.

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:19.600
So the actual name of that is the total differential,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.400
as opposed to the partial derivatives.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.420
Because, well, it's going to be the total differential,

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.220
because it includes all of the various causes that can change,

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.800
that can, sorry, all of the contributions that can

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.940
cause the value of your function f to change.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.880
So namely, let's say that you have a function f,

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:47.820
maybe of three variables x, y, z, then you will write df equals

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:56.580
f sub x dx plus f sub y dy plus f sub z dz.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.040
OK, or maybe just to remind you of the other notation,

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:10.520
partial f partial x dx plus partial f partial y dy plus partial f

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.340
over partial z dz.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.660
Now, what is this object?

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.720
What are the things on either side of this equality?

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.020
Well, they're called differentials,

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.900
and they're not numbers, they're not vectors,

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.740
they're not matrices, they're a different kind of object.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.260
So this things have their own rules of manipulations,

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.080
and we have to learn what we can do with them.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.200
So how do we think about them?

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.660
So first of all, how do we not think about them?

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.080
OK.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.960
So here's an important thing to be full to avoid.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:07.840
So important, the f is not the same thing as delta f.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.600
So that thing is meant to be a number.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.040
It's going to be a number once you have a small variation

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.700
of x, a small variation of y, a small variation of z.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.220
These are numbers, delta x, delta z are actual numbers,

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:22.820
and this becomes a number.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.860
This guy actually is not a number.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.200
You cannot give it a particular value.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.620
All you can do with a differential

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.980
is express it in terms of other differentials.

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.880
So in fact, this dx dy and dz, well, they're mostly symbols out

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.340
there, but if you want to think about them,

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.500
they're the differentials of x, y, and z.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.040
So in fact, you can think of these differentials

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.780
as placeholders where you will put other things.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:55.860
So of course, they represent, you know,

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.560
there's this idea of changes in x, y, z, and f.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.920
But so one way that one could explain it,

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.960
I don't really like that, is to say

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.160
they represent infinitesimal changes.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.880
Another way to say it, and I think that's probably

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.380
closer to the truth, is that these things are somehow placeholders

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.960
to put values and get a tangent approximation.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.380
So for example, if I do replace these symbols

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.840
by delta x, delta y, and delta z numbers,

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.600
then I will actually get a numerical quantity,

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.140
and that will be an approximation formula for delta f.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.920
It will be a linear approximation

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.360
of a tangent plane approximation.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:51.360
So what we can do, well, so let me start first with maybe

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.520
something even before that.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.060
So the first thing that it does is it can encode

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:07.420
how changes in x, y, z affect the value of f.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.440
I would say that's the most general answer

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.900
to what is this formula, what are these differentials.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:21.320
It's a relation between x, y, z, and f.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.260
And in particular, so this is a placeholder

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.680
for small variations.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Delta x, delta y, delta z, to get an approximation from

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:44.260
Europe.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:58.260
Which is delta f is approximately equal to f sub x delta x

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:03.060
plus f y delta y plus f z delta z.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.580
So it's getting cramped, but I'm sure you know what's going

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:05.780
here.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:13.500
So and observe how this one is actually equal

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.580
while that one is approximately equal.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:17.920
So they're really not the same.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:22.060
Another thing that the notation suggests we can do,

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.680
and the claim we can do, is divide everything

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.080
by some variable that everybody depends on.

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:32.560
So say, for example, that x, y, and z actually depend

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.280
on some parameter t.

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:39.840
Then they will vary at a certain rate, d x, d t,

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.460
d y, d t, d z, d t.

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:45.100
And what the differential will tell us, then,

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:48.320
is the rate of change of f as a function of t

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.980
when you plug in these values of x, y, z.

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:55.620
You will get d f d t by dividing everything by d t in here.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:16.500
So the first thing we can do is divide by, say, something

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:25.880
like d t to get an infinitesimal rate of change.

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:31.460
For instance, let me just say a rate of change.

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:53.540
So d f d t equals f sub x d x d t plus f sub y d t plus f

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:55.600
sub z d z d t.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:11:05.580
And that corresponds to the situation where x is a function

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:11.300
of t, y is a function of t, and z is a function of t.

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:15.680
Then that means you can plug in these values into f.

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:18.900
To get, well, the value of f will depend on t.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:23.120
And then you can find the rate of change with t of a value of f.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.640
So these are the basic rules.

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:33.080
And this is known as the chain rule.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:39.280
It's one instance of a chain rule, which

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:42.100
tells you when you have a function that depends on something,

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.260
and that something in turn depends on something else,

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.560
how to find the rate of change of a function

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:53.300
on the new variable in terms of the derivatives of a function,

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:57.520
and also the dependence between the various variables.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.260
Any questions so far?

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:13.820
So a word of warning, in particular, about what I said up

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:17.500
here, it's kind of unfortunate, but the textbook actually

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:19.820
has a serious mistake on that.

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:22.340
They do have a couple of formulas where they

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:23.480
mix a d with a delta.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.220
And I would like you not to do that, please.

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:32.140
So I mean, there's ds and there's

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:34.340
delta's, and basically they don't live in the same world.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.180
They don't see each other.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.620
The textbook is lying to you.

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:50.960
OK.

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:54.120
So let's see.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:59.740
I mean, here I made the first and the second claims.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.040
I don't really need to justify it, because the first one

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.160
is just stating some general principle

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.440
that I'm not making a precise mathematical claim.

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:11.460
The second one, well, we know that approximation

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:12.220
from you already.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:13.860
So I don't need to justify it for you.

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.880
But on the other hand, this formula here,

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:22.400
I mean, you probably have your right to expect some reason

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.560
for why this works.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:24.660
Why is this valid?

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:28.280
After all, I first told you we have this new mysterious

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.060
object, and then I'm telling you, well, we can do that.

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.280
But I can't have pulled it out of my head.

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:34.120
I mean, I don't have a head.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:34.360


00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.040
So.

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:40.380
OK.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:47.140
So why is this valid?

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.180
How can I get to this?

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:58.320
So here's a first attempt at justifying how to get there.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:00.880
OK.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.100
So let's see.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:17.240
Well, we say df is f sub x dx plus f sub y dy plus f sub z dz.

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:21.460
But we know, well, if x is a function of t,

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:29.180
then dx is x prime of t dt or dx dt dt, as you prefer.

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:35.340
dy is y prime of t dt.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.540
dz is z prime of t dt.

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:45.040
So if we plug this into that formula,

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:58.780
we'll get that df is f sub x times x prime of t dt plus f sub y

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:06.660
y prime of t dt plus f sub z z prime of t dt.

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:13.720
And now, well, if I have a relation between df and dt,

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.240
I got df equals something times dt.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.580
That means the rate of change of f with respect to t

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.440
should be that coefficient.

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:33.940
So if I divide by dt, then I get the formula that's,

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.040
I get the chain rule.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:47.960
Now, well, that kind of works, but that shouldn't be completely

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:48.260
satisfactory.

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:50.240
Let's say that you're a true skeptic,

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.040
and you don't believe in differentials yet.

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:59.280
Then it's maybe not very good that I actually used more

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:02.080
of these differential notations in deriving the answer.

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:05.560
So that's actually not how it's proved,

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:11.540
the way in which you prove the chain rule is not this way.

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.300
Because we shouldn't have too much trust in differentials

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:15.940
just yet.

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.820
At the end of today's lecture, yes, probably we should believe

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:21.780
in them, but so far, we should still

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:26.100
be a little bit reluctant to believe this kind of strange

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:28.700
object, telling us weird things.

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.600
So here's a better way to think about it.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.880
So one thing that we have trust in so far

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.200
are approximation formulas.

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:44.940
Yes, we should have trust in them.

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:53.240
So we should believe that if we change x a little bit,

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:54.960
if we change y a little bit,

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:04.900
then we are actually going to get a change in f

00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:08.360
that's approximately given by these guys.

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:14.080
So now, well, this is true for any changes in x, y, z,

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.680
but in particular, let's look at the changes that we get

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:21.220
if we just take these formulas as functions of time

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:24.260
and change time a little bit by delta t.

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:31.020
So we'll actually use the changes in x, y, z

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:32.700
in a small time delta t.

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:40.340
And let's divide everybody by delta t.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.520
Here, I'm just dividing numbers.

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.500
So I'm not actually playing any tricks on you.

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.400
I mean, we don't really know what it means to divide

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.720
differentials, but dividing numbers is something we know.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.540
And now, if I take delta t very small,

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:14.060
then this guy tends to the derivative dft.

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:20.480
Remember, the definition of dft is the limit of this ratio

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:24.300
when the time interval delta t tends to 0.

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:28.840
So that means if I choose smaller and smaller values

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:32.980
of delta t, then these ratios of numbers

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:36.500
will actually tend to some value, and that value is the derivative.

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:44.780
So similarly, here, delta x over delta t,

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:49.920
when delta t is really small, will tend to the derivative dx dt.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:19:00.080
And similarly, for the others.

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:13.060
OK.

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:26.100
So that means, in particular, so if we take the limit as

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:32.620
delta t tends to zero, we get dF dt on one side.

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:40.060
On the other side, we get f sub x dx dt plus f sub y dy dt plus

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:47.220
dz dt and the approximation becomes better and better.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:52.200
Remember, when we write approximately equal, that means that it's not

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.520
quite the same, but if we take smaller and smaller variations,

00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:00.600
then actually we'll end up with values that are getting closer

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.820
and closer. So then we take the limit as delta t tends to zero,

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:11.880
eventually we get an equality.

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:23.640
I mean, mathematicians have more complicated words to justify

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:28.920
this statement, but I will spare them for now and you will see about

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:32.860
them when you take analysis if you go on in that direction.

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:42.780
Okay, any questions so far? No?

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:47.440
Okay, so let's check maybe things in an example.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.420
Let's say that we really don't have any faith in these things.

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.880
So let's try to do it.

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:07.940
So let's say I give you a function that's x squared y plus z.

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:13.620
And let's say that maybe x will be t, y will be e to the t,

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.040
and z will be sine t.

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:36.940
Okay, so what does the chain rule say?

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:47.480
Tell us us that d w dt is, so we start with partial w,

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:50.880
the partial x. Well, what is that?

00:21:51.160 --> 00:22:04.940
That's 2 x y times, so maybe I should point out this is w sub x times dx dt plus

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:21.260
well, w sub y is x squared times dy dt plus w sub z that's going to be

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:23.880
just 1 dz dt.

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:32.200
Okay, and so now let's plug in the actual values of these things.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:38.000
So x is t, y is e to the t, so that will be 2 t e to the t,

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:49.480
dx dt is 1 plus x squared is t squared, dy dt is e to the t,

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:54.280
plus dz dt is cosine t.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:23:07.040
Okay, so at the end of calculation we get 2 t e to the t plus t squared e to the t plus cosine t.

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:10.880
That's what the chain rule tells us.

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.120
How else could we find that?

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:21.700
Well, we could just plug in values of x, y, and z, express w as a function of t and take its derivative.

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.680
Okay, let's do that just for verification.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.880
It should be exactly the same answer.

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:34.600
And in fact, in this case, the two calculations are awfully equal in complication.

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:41.160
But say that your function of x, y, z was much more complicated than that.

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:43.600
Or maybe you actually didn't know a formula for it.

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:44.860
You only knew its partial derivatives.

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:47.480
Then you would need to use the chain rule.

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:53.520
So sometimes plugging in values is easier, but not always.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.700
So let's just check quickly.

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:16.920
So the other method would be to substitute.

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:29.960
So w as a function of t, well, remember w was, was it x squared y plus z.

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:33.860
So as a function of t, well x was t.

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:39.560
So you get t squared y is e to the t plus z was sine t.

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:48.100
So d w dt, we know how to take the derivative using single variable calculus.

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:52.940
Well, we should know if we don't know then we should take a look at 1801 again.

00:24:54.760 --> 00:25:08.780
So by the product rule that will be derivative of t squared is 2t times e to the t plus t squared times the derivative of e to the t is e to the t plus cosine t.

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:15.160
And that's the same answer as over there.

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:25.280
So I ended up writing up, you know, maybe I wrote slightly more here, but actually the amount of calculations really was pretty much the same.

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:31.160
Okay, any questions about that?

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:32.060
Yes.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.460
What kind of object is w?

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:45.560
Well, I was intending, you know, you can think of w as just another variable that's given as a function of x, y, and z.

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:50.700
So you have a function of x, y, z defined by this formula.

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:54.140
And I call it w. I call it value w.

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:57.800
So that's then I can substitute t instead of x, y, z.

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:05.980
So w is, well, let's think of w as a function of free variables.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:12.820
Okay, and then when I plug in the dependence of this free variables on t, then it becomes just a function of t.

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:21.840
I mean, really my w here is pretty much what I called f before.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.040
There's no, you know, there's no major difference between the two.

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:32.420
Okay, any other questions?

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.200
No? Okay.

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:48.340
So let's see. Here's an application of what we've seen.

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:55.180
So let's say that you want to understand actually all these rules about taking derivatives in single variable calculus.

00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:02.640
So what I showed you at the beginning and then erased basically justifies how to take the derivative of a reciprocal function.

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:11.140
And for that, you didn't need multivariable calculus. But let's try to justify the product rule, for example, for the derivative.

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:23.240
So an application of this actually is to justify the product and quotient rules.

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:37.660
So let's think, for example, of a function of two variables, u and v, that's just the product u, v.

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:45.160
Okay, and let's say that u and v are actually functions of one variable t.

00:27:48.280 --> 00:28:00.980
Then, well, d by dt, df dt, so let's say d of uv over dt, is given by the chain rule applied to f.

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:13.180
This is df dt. So df dt should be f sub u, dudt, plus f sub v times dv dt.

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:31.600
Right? But now, what is the partial of f with respect to u? It's v. So that's v, dudt, and partial of f with respect to v is going to be just u.

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:45.060
So you get back the usual product rule. That's a slightly complicated way of deriving it.

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:51.560
But that's a valid way of understanding how to take the derivative of a product.

00:28:51.900 --> 00:29:00.520
By thinking of the product, first as a function of two variables, which are u and v, and then saying, oh, but u and v were actually functions of a variable t.

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:04.440
And then you do the differentiation in two stages using the chain rule.

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:14.200
Similarly, you can do the quotient rule, actually, let's do it just for practice.

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:24.520
So if I give you the function g equals u over v, so right now I'm thinking of it as a function of two variables, u and v.

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:44.540
But u and v themselves are actually going to be functions of t, then, well, dg dt is going to be partial g, partial u, how much is that?

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:59.040
How much is partial g, partial u? One over v times dudt plus, well, next we need to have partial g over partial v.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:04.660
Well, what's the derivative of this with respect to v? Well, here we need to know how to differentiate the inverse.

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:12.460
It's minus u over v squared times vv dt.

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:19.300
And that's actually the usual quotient rule just written in a slightly different way.

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:40.520
I mean, just in case you really want to see it, if you're clear denominators to put the v squared, then you will see basically v, well, u prime times v minus v prime times u.

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:47.220
Okay.

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:31.180
Now, let's go through something even more, slightly even more crazy.

00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:51.740
So, let's say that I have a quantity, let's call it w today for now.

00:31:51.740 --> 00:32:01.800
So, let's say I have quantity w as a function of, say, two variables x and y. And so, in the previous setup, x and y depended on some parameter t.

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:11.940
But actually, let's now look at the case where x and y themselves are functions of several variables. Let's say of two more variables. Let's call them u and v.

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:34.940
Okay. So, I'm going to stay with these abstract letters. But, you know, if it bothers you, if it sounds completely unmotivated, think about it maybe in terms of something you might know, say polar coordinates.

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:52.400
Let's say that I have a function that's defined in terms of the polar coordinate variables r and theta. And then I know actually I want to switch to u, the coordinates x and y. Or the other way around, I have a function of x and y. And I want to express it in terms of the polar coordinates r and theta.

00:32:54.300 --> 00:33:02.520
Then, I would like to know maybe how the derivatives, with respect to the various sets of variables, are related to each other.

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:20.440
Okay. So, one way I could do it is, of course, to say, well, now, if I plug the formula for x and the formula for y into the formula for f,

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:31.920
then w becomes a function of u and v. And I can try to take its partial derivatives. If I have explicit formulas, well, that could work, but maybe the formulas are complicated.

00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:44.140
Typically, if I switch, you know, between rectangular and polar coordinates, there might be inverse trig. There might be maybe arc tangent to express the polar angle in terms of x and y.

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:51.400
And then I don't really want to actually substitute arc tangents everywhere. Maybe I'd rather deal with the derivatives.

00:33:54.760 --> 00:34:14.120
So, how do I do that? So, the question is, what are partial w over partial u and partial w over partial v in terms of x and y?

00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:26.920
So, let's see. What do we need to know, to understand that? Well, probably we should know how w depends on x and y. If we don't know that, then we are probably toast.

00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:34.700
Okay. So, partial w, partial x, partial w, partial y should be required.

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:44.460
What else would we know? Well, it would probably help to know how x and y depend on u and v. If we don't know that, then we don't really know how to do it either.

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:58.880
So, we need also, well, you sub x, sorry, people around. x sub u, x sub v, y sub u, y sub v. So, we have a lot of partial in there.

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:04.420
Well, so let's see how we can do that.

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:21.540
So, let's start by writing dw. So, we know that dw is partial f, well, I don't know why I have two names, w and f.

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:34.820
I mean, w and f are really the same thing here, but let's say f sub x dx plus f sub y dy. Okay. So far, that's our new friend, the differential.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:51.520
Now, what do we want to do with it? Well, we'd like to get rid of dx and dy because we'd like to express things in terms of, you know, the question we're asking ourselves is, let's say that I changed u a little bit.

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:59.340
How does w change? So, of course, what will happen is if I change u a little bit, then x and y will change.

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:14.300
How do they change? Well, that's given to me by the differential. Alright. So, dx is going to be, well, I can use the differential.

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:25.220
Again, you know, dx, well, x is a function of u and v, that will be x sub u times du plus x sub v times dv.

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:31.920
That's again taking the differential of a function of two variables, does that make sense?

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:46.600
Then we have the other guy f sub y times what is dy? Well, similarly, dy is y sub u du plus y sub v dv.

00:36:49.040 --> 00:37:00.780
And now, we have a relation between dw and du and dv. We're expressing how w reacts to changes in u and v, which was our goal.

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:04.800
Now, let's actually collect terms so that we see it a bit better.

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:25.960
So, that's going to be f sub x times x sub u plus f sub y times y sub u du plus f sub x sub v plus f sub y y sub v dv.

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:42.560
And so, now we have dw equals something du plus something dv. Well, that coefficient here has to be partial f partial u, what else could it be?

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:53.040
That's the rate of change of w with respect to u if I forget what happens when I change v. That's the definition of a partial.

00:37:54.800 --> 00:38:11.240
Similarly, this one has to be partial f over partial v. That's because it's the rate of change with respect to v if I keep u constant so that these guys are completely ignored.

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:24.120
Now, you see how the total differential accounts for somehow all the partial derivatives that come as coefficients of the individual variables in these expressions.

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:32.180
Let me maybe rewrite this formulas in a more visible way and then we explain them to you.

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:46.540
So, here's the chain rule for this situation with two intermediate variables and two variables that you express these in terms of.

00:38:47.500 --> 00:39:04.500
So, in our setting, we get partial f over partial u equals partial f over partial x, partial x over partial u plus partial f over partial y times partial y over partial u.

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:24.320
And the other one, same thing with v instead of u, partial f partial x times partial x partial v plus partial f partial y partial y partial v.

00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:34.180
So, I have to explain various things about these formulas because they look complicated and actually they're not that complicated.

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:37.780
So, a couple of things to know.

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:46.240
The first thing, so how do we remember a formula like that? Well, that's easy. We want to know how f depends on u.

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:55.240
Well, what does f depend on actually? It depends on x and y. So, we'll put partial f partial x and partial f partial y.

00:39:56.080 --> 00:40:05.500
Now, x and y, y over here, well, they're here because they actually depend on u as well. How does x depend on u? Well, the answer is partial x partial u.

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:09.740
How does y depend on u? The answer is partial y partial u.

00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:24.420
So, see, the structure of this formula is simple. To find the partial of f with respect to some new variable, you use the partial with respect to the variables that f was initially defined in terms of x and y.

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:34.720
And you multiply them by the partial of x and y in terms of the new variable that you want to look at, v here. And you sum these things together.

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:44.480
So, that's the structure of the formula. Why does it work? Well, let me explain it to you in a slightly different language.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:55.020
So, this asks us how does f change if I change u a little bit? Well, why would f change if u changes a little bit?

00:40:55.020 --> 00:41:05.020
Well, it would change because f actually depends on x and y and x and y depend on u. If I change u, how quickly does x change? Well, the answer is partial x partial u.

00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:13.600
And now, if I change x at this rate, how does that cause f to change? Well, the answer is partial f partial x times this guy.

00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:23.960
Well, at the same time, y is also changing. How fast is y changing if I change u? Well, the rate of partial y partial u.

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:37.720
But now, if I change y, how does f change? Well, the rate of change is partial f partial y. So, the product is the effect of, you know, how u changes changing y and therefore changing f.

00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:47.640
Now, what happens in real life if I change u a little bit? Well, both x and y change at the same time. So, how does f change? Well, it's the sum of the two effects.

00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:58.660
Okay, does that make sense? Good. Of course, if f depends on more variables than you just have, you know, you just have more turns in here.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:11.880
Okay, here's another thing that may be a little bit confusing. So, what is tempting? Well, what's tempting here would be to simplify these formulas by, you know, removing these partial x's.

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:22.240
So, let's simplify by partial x. Let's simplify by partial y. We get partial f partial u equals partial f partial u plus partial f partial u. Something is not working properly.

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:31.460
Okay, so why doesn't it work? Well, the answer is precisely because these are partial derivatives. These are not total derivatives.

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:41.440
And so, you cannot simplify them in that way. I mean, and that's actually the reason why we use this curly d rather than a straight d. It's to remind us beware.

00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:51.300
There's these simplifications that we can do with straight d's that are not legal here. So, somehow when you have a partial derivative, you must resist the urge of simplifying things.

00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:04.520
Okay, so no simplifications in here. That's the simplest formula you can get. Okay, any questions at this point?

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:14.920
Yes?

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:27.440
So, when would you use this? And what does it describe? Well, it's basically when you have a function given in terms of a certain set of variables.

00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:38.700
Because maybe there's a simple expression in terms of those variables. But, ultimately, what you care about is not those variables x and y, but another set of variables here, u and v.

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:48.780
So, x and y are giving you a nice formula for f, but actually the relevant variables for your problem are u and v. And you know how x and y are related to u and v.

00:43:49.340 --> 00:44:00.020
So, of course, what you could do is you could plug the formulas, the way that we did substituting, but maybe that will give you very complicated expressions. And maybe it's actually easier to just work with the derivatives.

00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:06.580
So, the important claim here is basically we don't need to know the actual formulas, or we need to know it's the rates of changes.

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:13.720
If we know all these rates of change, then we know how to take these derivatives without actually having to plug in values.

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:31.140
Yes? Yes, you could certainly do the same things in terms of t. If x and y were functions of t instead of being functions of u and v, then it would be the same thing.

00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:38.860
And you would have the same formulas that I had, well over there, I still have it. So, why does that one have straight d's?

00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:44.860
Well, the answer is I could put curly d's if I wanted, but I end up with a function of a single variable.

00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:50.100
So, if you have a single variable, then the partial with respect to that variable is the same thing as the usual derivative.

00:44:51.120 --> 00:45:02.780
So, we don't actually need to worry about curly in that case. But that one is indeed, it's a special case of this one, where instead of x and y depending on two variables u and v, they depend on a single variable t.

00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:07.020
Now, of course, whether you call your variables, you know, any name you want, it doesn't matter.

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:21.220
But so, this is just a slight generalization of that. Well, not quite, because here I also had a z. I mean, I'm trying to just confuse you by giving you functions that depend on various numbers of variables.

00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:29.260
If you have a function of 30 variables, things work the same way, it's just very longer, and you're going to run out of letters in the alphabet before the end.

00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:43.440
Okay. Any other questions? No? Yes? What? Yes?

00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:57.980
So, if you and v have a variable, what does that mean?

00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:11.840
So, if you, in terms of using that chain rule, sorry, sorry, if you and v depended on yet another variable, then you could get the derivative with respect to that using first the chain rule to pass from u, v to that new variable.

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:21.300
And then you would plug in this formulas for the partial of respect to u and v. So, in fact, if you have several substitutions to do, you can always arrange to use one chain rule at a time.

00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:28.800
You just have to, you know, do them in sequence. So, that's why we don't actually learn that, but you can just do it by repeating the process.

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:38.780
I mean, probably at that stage, the easiest to not get confused actually is to manipulate differentials, because that's probably easier. Yes?

00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:56.780
So, curly f does not exist. That's easy. Okay? Curly f makes no sense. But it doesn't exist alone. What exists is only curly f, curly d, f over curly d some variable.

00:46:56.780 --> 00:47:08.540
And then that accounts only for the rate of change with respect to that variable, leaving the overs fixed. While straight d f is somehow a total variation of f.

00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:23.240
And so it accounts for all of the partial derivatives and their combined effects. Okay. Any more questions? No?

00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:37.080
Okay. So, let me just finish very quickly by telling you again, you know, one example where concretely you might want to do this is you have a function that you want to switch between rectangular and polar coordinates.

00:47:44.280 --> 00:48:03.800
So, just to make things a little bit more concrete. So, if you had polar coordinates, that means that, you know, in the plane instead of using coordinates x and y, you will use coordinates r in distance to the origin and theta the angle from the x-axis.

00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:27.700
So, the change of variables for that is x equals r cosine theta and y equals r sine theta. And so, that means, well, if you have a function f that depends on x and y, then in fact you can plug this and get a function of r and theta.

00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:47.880
And then you can ask yourself, well, what is partial f of the partial r? And that's going to be, well, you want to take partial f, partial x, partial x, partial r plus partial f, partial y, partial r.

00:48:47.880 --> 00:49:02.160
And so, that will end up being actually f sub x times cosine theta plus f sub y times sine theta. And you can do the same thing to find partial f, partial theta.

00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:09.520
And so, you can express derivatives either in terms of x, y or in terms of r and theta with simple relations between them.

00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:30.520
And the, oh, yes. And one last thing I should say. So, on Thursday, we learn about more tricks we can play with variations of functions. And one that's important because you need to know it actually to do the piece set is the gradient vector.

00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:48.680
So, the gradient vector, it's simply a vector. So, you use this downward pointing triangle as a notation for the gradient. It's simply a vector whose components are the partial derivatives of a function.

00:49:49.380 --> 00:50:01.400
Okay, so it's, I mean, in a way you can think of a different way as a way to package partial derivatives together into some weird object. Well, the gradient is also a way to package, perforces together.

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:06.800
So, we'll see on Thursday what it's good for that some of the problems on the piece set use it.
