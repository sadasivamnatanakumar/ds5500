00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.080
So let's continue with our discussion of the derivative.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:34.380
Let me recall that the derivative of a function if it exists, which we denote by f prime of c.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:42.660
This is the limit as x goes to c of f of x minus f of c over x minus c.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:56.740
Last time we look at the relationship between continuity and differentiability and show that differentiability implies continuity.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:07.060
But having a derivative is quite a miraculous thing because there are continuous functions which we actually constructed.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.560
We constructed a continuous function. You can generalize that example.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:19.780
So we constructed a continuous function that is differentiable nowhere.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.860
In fact, differentiability is a much stronger condition than continuity and it's something of a miracle.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:44.360
You know, just as a side note, if you go on to study complex analysis, which are functions of a complex variable rather than a real variable, you also have the notion of a derivative there.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:52.480
And then the derivative is much more miraculous than it is here in the setting of r.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.280
But the whole point is the derivative is something of a miracle.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.760
So today the goal is to prove some properties about the derivatives.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.940
Most of these you know, maybe you didn't cover the proofs of them in calculus.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:27.700
With the ultimate goal of proving the mean value theorem, which is to me kind of, you know, probably the most underappreciated but most important result in calculus.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:43.920
Now you could argue that probably the hero of the story of calculus is the fundamental theorem of calculus which connects integration, which will cover next after differentiation, which so the fundamental theorem of calculus connects integration and differentiation.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:53.040
So that really is, and that is really the hero of calculus gets used more than anything else.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.300
But to prove that, you use the mean value theorem.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:08.400
So, you know, if the fundamental theorem of calculus was Batman, I would say the mean value theorem is something like Alfred.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.500
You know, he's really the reason why Batman gets to be who he is.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:20.240
All right, enough analogies for now. Let's go back to proving some properties of the derivative.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:34.980
So first let's do some basic linearity and rules for the derivative.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:43.440
So let f go from i to r. i is always some interval.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.120
So I have two functions f and g from i to r. c is a point in i.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:26.260
And the conclusion is if f and g are differentiable at c, then we have several rules that we can apply the first is basically the linearity.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:49.860
So, the derivative of the derivative that for all alpha and r, the function alpha at plus g, which now goes from i to r, is differentiable at c.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:05:06.480
And the derivative of the function alpha f plus g prime c is alpha times f prime of c plus g prime of c.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.640
I think I'm sort of right a little slanted here.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:41.620
Second is the multiplication rule, which is the function f times g is differentiable at c and the derivative of the product is not the derivative of the product.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:50.040
The product of the derivatives, but the prime of c g of c plus f of c g prime of c.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:06:00.580
So that's a multiplication rule. And then we also have the quotient rule.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:15.080
And just like when you need to divide by something, you need to assume that you're never dividing by zero.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:39.340
So, if g of x is not equal to zero for all x and i, then the function f over g is differentiable at c.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:58.440
And the derivative is the derivative of the top times the bottom minus the top times the derivative of the bottom over the bottom square.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:12.480
So, I'll prove one and two, three will leave as an exercise.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:42.460
So, for one we just compute that the limit as x goes to c of alpha f plus g of x minus alpha f plus g prime of c.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:57.400
This is just by definition alpha times f of x plus g of x minus alpha times f of c plus g of c.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:18.680
And so, this equals the limit as x goes to c and just collecting terms alpha times f of x minus f of c times x minus c plus g of x minus g of c over x minus c.

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:40.720
And all of these limits exist. So, this is just a fixed number. The limit as x goes to c of this exists and this exists. So, by what we know about limits, namely that the limit of the sum is the sum of the limits.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:51.520
And then the scalars just pull out of the limit. This is equal to alpha times f prime of c plus g prime of c. So, that's proof of the first one.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:09:03.800
For the proof of the second one, we'll use the fact that a function which is differentiable at a point is also continuous at a point.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:29.460
So, this g is differentiable at c. It is continuous at c, i.e. limit as x goes to c of g of x equals g of c.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:45.500
Now, we compute the limit as x goes to c of f times g of x minus f of c times g of c over x minus c.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:10:15.360
Now, what I'm going to do is add and subtract f of c times g of x. So, this I can write as the limit as x goes to c of f of x minus f of c over x minus c times g of x plus g of x.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:22.420
So, f of c times g of x minus g of c over x minus c.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:41.580
And again, so this limit as x goes to c exists. This is just the derivative of f at c. And we noted that since g is differentiable at c, g is also continuous at c, meaning the limit as x goes to c of g of x equals g of c.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:59.000
This is just a constant f of c. This goes to g prime of c. So, all these limits exist. And therefore, we get that this is equal to f prime of c times g of c plus f of c g prime of c.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:16.200
And three, I'll leave as an exercise. Again, you know, you'll write out. You'll add and subtract something to f of x over g of x minus f of c over g of c.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:22.780
And you use the fact that we have continuity, that differentiability at a point implies continuity and just evaluate the limit.

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:35.400
So, I'm going to stop with these two rules. I don't know why I called it the multiplication rule. It's called the product rule.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.740
Well, multiplication and product is the same thing.

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:56.440
But we also have the chain rule, which requires a little more care to prove than what we've done so far for these rules.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:03.080
So, suppose I have two intervals.

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:17.640
And then I have a function g going from i1 to i2, f going from i2 to r.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:38.860
And suppose g is differentiable at c. And f is differentiable at g of c.

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:54.380
Then the function f of g, which now goes from i1 to r.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:18.780
This is differentiable at c. And the derivative equals f prime of g of c times g prime of c.

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:22.540
Okay.

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:29.540
Okay.

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:51.430
So, what's the basic idea again?

00:13:51.430 --> 00:14:21.070
So, this is basic idea is that we write the difference quotient g of x minus f of g of c over x minus c as f of g of x minus g of c times g of x minus g of c.

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:41.530
And then we'll pick up the derivative of g here at c. And right here, this is f of something converging to g of c.

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:53.650
And so, this should be like f prime of g of c. But the only problem with really writing this down is that there could be points where g of x equals g of c. And then I'm dividing by zero. That's not allowed.

00:14:53.650 --> 00:15:09.090
So, writing this expression is meaningless. But we're going to do something like this in spirit, where at least when g of x does not equal g of c, this thing kind of equals this thing.

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:14.930
Okay. That's kind of the basic idea.

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:31.490
Okay. So, to implement this strategy, let's introduce some notation and a few auxiliary functions.

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:45.150
So, first off, the function we're interested in taking the derivative of f of g. Let me call that h of x because I don't want to have to keep writing f of g of x.

00:15:47.250 --> 00:16:08.210
Let's call d. This will be the point g of c. So, we want to show. Then that h prime of c exists. And it's equal to f prime of d times g prime of c.

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:30.810
Yeah. Just in this notation, I've set up. Okay. So, now, let me define some auxiliary functions u of y. This is going to be essentially the difference quotient of f except at certain points.

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:48.730
So, this is f of y minus f of d over y minus d when y does not equal d. So, this is meaningful. And then f prime of d when y equals d. And then v of x.

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:59.710
So, this is going to be, this is going to kind of play the role of, you know, that first expression I wrote up there, f of g of x minus f of g of c. Okay.

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:05.730
And then v of x. This will be g of x minus g of c.

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:22.790
x minus c when x does not equal c and g prime of c when x equals c. Okay. Now, essentially what?

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:48.090
Okay. So, what do we, what do we have here? Then if I look at f of y minus f of d, this is equal to u of y times y minus d. Always. Right?

00:17:50.010 --> 00:18:01.650
Because if y does not equal d, then I divide over and I get u of y. Then I get f of y minus f of d on the left hand side over y minus d. And that's equal to u of y by definition.

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:21.650
And then when y equals d, I get zero here and I get zero over here. So, that's clear. And also the same here, g of x minus g of c equals v of x minus x minus c. Okay.

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:39.270
All right. So, we have these two expressions. And one more thing I want to note is that u and v are continuous at y equals d and x equals c respectively.

00:18:41.750 --> 00:19:07.550
So, note that v of y is continuous at d and v of x is continuous at c. So, let's look at the proof of that. We just need to show that the limit as y goes to d of v of y equals v of d.

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:22.490
So, compute the limit as y goes to d of v of y. Now, when we look at limits, remember, we never were not allowed to put y equals d in the expression for this limit.

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:43.350
Okay. We're always looking at points y close to d but not equal to d is what I'm what I'm saying. And so, therefore, when y is near d and not equal to d, v of y is given by, I should, this is, you here, sorry, you. Okay.

00:19:44.730 --> 00:20:03.750
So, we're looking at y near d but not equal to d and therefore, it's given by this expression. So, this is the limit as y goes to d of f of y minus f of d over y minus d. And this is just the definition of the derivative of f at d.

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:18.190
So, remember, d is g of c. So, f is differentiable there. And this is, by definition, u of d. Right. So, this function, u is continuous at y equals d.

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:37.730
And similarly, the limit as x goes to c of u of x, v of x equals v of c, equal, which is g prime of c.

00:20:37.730 --> 00:21:06.890
Okay. So, now we're going to combine whatever it in here to finish the proof. So, in h of x minus h of c, this is equal to f of g of x minus f of g of c.

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:25.470
And this is equal to u of g of x times g of x minus g of c. This is from this relation here. So, we'll call this one star.

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:52.630
This one, double star. So, this is by star. And now I use the second relation, double star, to write g of x minus g of c equals v of x times x minus c.

00:21:54.750 --> 00:22:20.710
And therefore, the limit as x goes to c of h of x minus h of c, where x minus c, this is equal to the limit as x goes to c of u of g of x times v of x.

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:32.430
Now, u is continuous at g of c. g is continuous at c. And we prove that the composition of two continuous functions is continuous.

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:52.530
So, this equals u of g of c. And v of x, we've proven already that limit is v of c. And u of g of c, you know, so this is d. Remember, in the notation we had earlier.

00:22:52.530 --> 00:23:06.670
And therefore, that equals f prime of g of c. Remember, g of c was d times g prime of c.

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:33.510
So, to go from this point to this point, we use the fact that u is continuous at c, which we proved, u is continuous at g of c, which we proved over there. And that g is continuous at c. And therefore, the composition of two continuous functions is continuous at that point to arrive at this guy.

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:57.790
But again, the whole basic idea was to be able to write the difference quotient as kind of a product of what looks like the difference quotient of f times the difference quotient of g. But you have to be careful because g of x could equal g of c, in which case you're dividing by zero in this basic idea we had up there, which is not allowed.

00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:08.690
But you get around it by using these functions, which equal what you want, as long as you're not dividing by zero, basically.

00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:20.530
Okay, so that wraps it up for basic properties of the derivative.

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:33.950
And now we're going to move on to trying to prove the mean value theorem.

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:48.870
The Alfred of this Batman tale.

00:24:53.590 --> 00:25:05.450
But first, in order to prove this, we'll need a result about the derivative in relation to certain relative minimum and relative maximum.

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:08.090
So let me first define what this means.

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:18.030
Let s be a subset of r, f be a function from s to r.

00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:45.690
Let's say f as a relative max at c in s, if there exists a delta positive such that for all x in s x minus c is less than delta.

00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:50.750
Then f of x is less than or equal to f of c.

00:25:51.730 --> 00:26:17.710
Okay, so the picture here, and then let me state that there's analogous definition of relative min at c.

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:20.510
So let me just take this entire definition and flip the inequality.

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:25.710
That's the definition for relative min. So what this means, pictorially.

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:30.090
Remember we have this notion of absolute min and absolute max.

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:39.410
And absolute max at a point c means every other point at every other point in s, f of x lies below f of c.

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:47.450
Here we're just saying as long as you're close to the point c, then you label o f of c.

00:26:52.830 --> 00:27:05.090
Let's say our function looks something like that.

00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:20.450
Okay, so then, let's say we're at this point here.

00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:38.230
So this would be absolute max because the graph of the function sits below the value of the function at this point for all x in this interval a, b.

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:57.530
Okay, and then here at this point we would have an absolute min, right, because the rest of, because the graph of the function sits above that point for all x in this interval.

00:27:57.530 --> 00:28:16.930
But now if I go to this point, say, this would be a relative max, okay, because why if I look at, you know, an interval, small interval around it.

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:26.510
And I look inside this interval, there's too many dash lines going on, so I'm going to erase this.

00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:53.530
Now I'm just going to do away with the dash. If I zoom in on just this one piece of the graph, then at this point, the graph sits below this point inside this little vertical strip.

00:28:53.530 --> 00:29:14.150
Okay, so this guy would be a relative max. And then similarly, at this point here, maybe it's a, let me, so you can really see what graph is.

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:29.010
So this should have brought different colors. At this point, we have a relative min, right, because nearby, nearby points sit above the value of the function evaluated at this point.

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:40.910
Okay, so relative max means nearby points, F sits below that F evaluated at that point and relative min is the other way around.

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:57.230
Okay, so I don't think we need to, um, believe her, the point of what relative min relative maxes are, I think that's pretty clear.

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:12.250
Okay, so the theorem is the following.

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:34.570
If F from AB has a relative min or max at a point C, strictly inside this closed interval in the open interval AB,

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:54.070
then F is differentiable at C, then F prime of C equals zero, right.

00:30:54.070 --> 00:31:11.570
And this is kind of clear from this picture, although this kind of might look more like a sawtooth, but it shouldn't, that the tangent at this point is horizontal, and the tangent at this point is horizontal, which is the expression that, which is expressing that F prime of C equals zero, right.

00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:14.790
So F prime of C is supposed to be the slope of the tangent.

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:16.970


00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:35.070
Okay, so the idea of the proof is, um, and we'll do it for relative max relative min you get by taking minus F.

00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:52.610
Um, so we'll do it for, suppose F has a relative max at C and AB.

00:31:57.570 --> 00:32:18.850
Okay, then, um, so I'm just going to draw a picture to illustrate why this is the case, so, or why would I'm about to say is the case, we have AB, we have C, then there exists delta positive,

00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:28.750
let's say delta 1, such that two things are true.

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:56.390
So, um, X or C minus delta 1 plus delta 1 is contained in AB, two for all X and C minus delta 1, C plus delta 1, F of X is less than or equal to F of C.

00:32:57.250 --> 00:33:07.490
Okay, so, you know, delta 1 is chosen as the minimum of, so maybe, let me not call it delta, let me, one, let me just call it delta.

00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:19.690
So, um, first off, you know that AB, open interval, this is an open set, which we've encountered in the assignments.

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:39.370
So, um, you can find a delta, so that delta 0 say, so that this interval centered at C is contained in AB.

00:33:40.110 --> 00:34:01.590
Right, now, since F has a relative maximum at this point, there exists another delta 1 say, so that if, um, I'm inside that interval, then F of X is less than or equal to F of C for all X and that interval.

00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:16.430
Okay, and I choose delta to be the minimum of these two, these two delta's and then I will have, um, chosen delta, so that X, that C minus delta C plus delta is.

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:26.250
So, here, this one is.

00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:41.310
And then delta 0 shows, and so that that is contained, so I choose the minimum of these delta's and this is the delta I take for, for the statement.

00:34:41.310 --> 00:35:06.890
Okay, all right, so, um, now the way we get that the derivative is zero is we're going to approach C from above and from below and use the, um, the fact that we have a relative max to show that the derivative is both bigger than or equal to zero and less than or equal to zero.

00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:28.510
All right, so let X in be, um, C minus, um, I write this delta over 2N, which is in the interval C minus delta C for all N.

00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:44.210
Then what do we know X in the limit as n goes to infinity of C minus delta over 2N converges to C.

00:35:46.670 --> 00:36:02.210
So, the derivative at C is equal to the limit as n goes to infinity of f of X sub n minus f of C over X sub n minus C.

00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:15.970
Now, um, what do we note? So, X sub n is in this interval here, which is contained in this interval here, and therefore f of X sub n is always less than or equal to f of C.

00:36:15.970 --> 00:36:30.250
So, what's on top is always less than or equal to zero. Okay, now X sub n is always less than C. So, this thing on bottom is also less than zero.

00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:38.730
And therefore, something that's less than or equal to zero on top over something that's less than zero on bottom must be bigger than or equal to zero.

00:36:44.050 --> 00:37:06.430
So, that's approaching C from the left. If we approach C from the right, delta over 2N, which is contained in C, C plus delta for all N, then X in converges to C.

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:26.330
And we look at f of C. Again, this is equal to limit as n goes to infinity of f of Y sub n minus f of C over Y sub n minus C. Again, f of C is a relative maximum.

00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:42.910
So, this thing on top is still less than or equal to zero. And the thing on bottom, though, is now since Y sub n is bigger than C, this is positive. So, something on top is negative, something on top is positive. So, the limit must be negative.

00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:53.310
So, we've just shown f prime of C is both bigger than or equal to zero. And then it's also less than or equal to zero.

00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:06.910
And therefore, the derivative is zero at this point.

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:28.270
They get in the proof for a relative minimum is very similar, except that inequality flip signs.

00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:38.330
And therefore, you would get this is less than or equal to zero. This one would be bigger than or equal to zero. But you still get f prime of C is bounded between zero and zero.

00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:55.410
So, at a point where we have a relative minimum, strictly inside the interval, the derivative must be zero.

00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:14.950
And the fact that it happens strictly inside the interval is important. This is not necessarily true if the relative max or relative men happens at an endpoint. Think of f of x equals x on zero one.

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:34.610
And it has a absolute minimum at zero, absolute maximum at one, and the derivative is one at both points, not zero. So, this is only for relative men, relative maxes that occur inside, strictly inside the interval that the functions defined on and words differentiable.

00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:58.010
Okay, so now we have roles theorem, which is essentially the mean value theorem rotated. We'll get the mean value theorem from roles theorem, and which states the following.

00:40:03.010 --> 00:40:05.070
f b from a b to r.

00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:29.430
b continuous. So, it's continuous at every point in a b, differentiable at every point inside of a b. Okay, it could be differentiable at the end point.

00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:33.230
So, it's fine, but it has to be differentiable on the open interval a b.

00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:57.070
f of b a equals f of b equals zero. Then, there exists a point c, the open interval a b. This is important, such that f prime of c equals zero.

00:40:57.950 --> 00:41:08.730
Alright, and what's the picture that goes with this? I'm sure you've seen it before. Let me draw a function.

00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:26.630
I look like sine or cosine, but anyways, function which is zero here, zero here, then there has to exist a point where the tangent is vertical.

00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:46.090
So, in fact here, it can occur at two different points. But something that's already kind of giving the game away as far as how we'll prove this is, let's look at where the function takes a maximum and a minimum.

00:41:46.090 --> 00:42:00.090
Okay, you know, that is the heart of the proof. And why can we, why does it even have an absolute maximum or absolute minimum?

00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:15.250
So, I guess I didn't say this over there when I discussed relative men and relative max, but an absolute maximum is also a relative maximum. And absolute minimum is also a relative minimum.

00:42:18.850 --> 00:42:23.150
So, let me make this, this is kind of a late remark.

00:42:26.970 --> 00:42:49.030
So, Mark absolute max is a relative max. Absolute min is a relative min.

00:42:51.750 --> 00:43:08.630
Okay, alright, so this picture is kind of given the game away already. Let's look at where the function takes a max and a min. And why does F take a max or a min? It's because F is continuous on this closed and bounded interval.

00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:18.430
So, this is something we prove when we were discussing continuity the min max theorem. So, let's skip the proof.

00:43:25.210 --> 00:43:46.770
Since F is continuous on AB F achieves a relative max at some point C1 and AB.

00:43:46.770 --> 00:44:00.750
So, let's see, and relative min at C2 and AB. Okay.

00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:28.970
If there exists a x, well, so, if of F of C1 is positive, then what can you say? Well, C1 cannot be one of the endpoints because at the endpoints, F of A equals F of B equals 0.

00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:47.270
This implies C1 is in the open interval AB, which implies by the previous theorem F prime of C1 equals 0. So, here you see equals C1.

00:44:47.270 --> 00:45:16.930
So, if I'm at the minimum now, and this is less than 0, then again, this implies that C2 is in the open interval AB, which implies since F has a minimum at C2, F prime of C2 equals 0 by the previous theorem.

00:45:16.930 --> 00:45:19.530
And therefore, we could take C equals C2.

00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:37.830
Now, this is two cases. F of C1, if either F of C1 is positive or F of C2 is less than 0, then we have the result.

00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:44.490
If F of C1 is less than or equal to 0 is less than or equal to F of C2.

00:45:46.070 --> 00:45:54.930
Now, remember, F achieves a max at C1. F achieves a min at C2, and therefore, this should always be less than or equal to this.

00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:17.610
If the max and the min, so first off,

00:46:22.530 --> 00:46:25.030
I'll make sure I'm getting my logic correct here.

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:52.070
Okay, so rather than state it this way, let's do it like this.

00:47:02.130 --> 00:47:09.990
So, in terms of the picture here, this would be C1, C2, where we achieve a max and a min.

00:47:11.310 --> 00:47:36.770
Okay, then in the final case that F of C1 and then, so this is the max,

00:47:36.770 --> 00:47:41.390
0 is equal to F evaluated at a point.

00:48:07.810 --> 00:48:11.370
Alright, so let me go back to whatever we have.

00:48:11.370 --> 00:48:19.470
So, in the last case that F of C1 is less than or equal to 0 is less than F of C2.

00:48:20.050 --> 00:48:32.510
Now remember, this is the min, this is the max of F. So, this should always set above F of C2.

00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:42.330
So, that implies that F of C1 equals F of C2, and therefore, the max and min equal each other.

00:48:42.330 --> 00:49:00.450
Right, which implies for all X and AB, since F of C1 is the minimum, or F of C2 is,

00:49:08.550 --> 00:49:16.090
so I started off with something here, there, in between, which implies for all X and AB,

00:49:16.090 --> 00:49:24.450
F of C, F of X equals F of C2, so that means F is constant.

00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:49.370
So, we can take the midpoint, and that's the end.

00:49:50.170 --> 00:49:57.550
Okay, so I just hope that I kind of fumbled through that for a minute, but, okay.

00:49:58.570 --> 00:50:08.110
So, for any function, which is 0 at the end points, there has to be a point in between where the function is,

00:50:08.930 --> 00:50:10.970
the derivative of the function equals 0.

00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:23.170
Now, again, we should come back to, you know, when we see a theorem, we should kind of pick it apart a little bit to see what's necessary, what's not.

00:50:24.610 --> 00:50:33.390
You know, we had these two hypotheses coming in that the function is continuous and differentiable on this open-enterable AB.

00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:36.510
Are these necessary?

00:50:36.510 --> 00:51:00.610
So, for example, let's say I have the function, if I look at the function,

00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:17.810
then 1 minus the absolute value of X, so at minus 1, 1, 1, this is a continuous function on

00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:35.530
minus 1, 1, and F of minus 1 equals F of 1 equals 0, but there is no point where F prime of C equals 0.

00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:38.710
What hypothesis did I leave out for this function?

00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:43.250
The fact that it's the hypothesis that it's differentiable at every point in between.

00:51:44.070 --> 00:51:45.830
This function is not differentiable.

00:51:57.550 --> 00:52:00.130
But there's no point where the derivative equals 0.

00:52:00.930 --> 00:52:16.690
So, this example tells you that the hypothesis that the function is differentiable on the interval minus 1, 1, or AB is necessary for the theorem to be true.

00:52:17.490 --> 00:52:18.530
That's what I'm getting at.

00:52:26.090 --> 00:52:35.350
Now, you know, the other hypothesis that the function is continuous on the closed interval is also necessary.

00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:47.350
Let's say I look at, and this is pretty easy to come up with a counter example if I don't assume that.

00:52:47.350 --> 00:53:06.930
Let's take the function which is

00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:29.050
x minus 1 for x, not equal to minus 1 and 0 for x equal to minus 1.

00:53:29.050 --> 00:53:31.130
So, what does this function look like?

00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:55.630
So, this function here is differentiable on minus 1, 1, F of minus 1 equals F of 1 equals 0.

00:53:55.630 --> 00:54:06.390
So, but again, there's no point in minus 1, 1, so that F of C equals 0.

00:54:08.210 --> 00:54:12.450
Because the derivative in between minus 1, 1 is just 1.

00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:24.130
So, both of these hypotheses that F is continuous on the closed interval and differentiable on the open interval are necessary for this theorem to be true.

00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:28.750
If you drop either of those hypotheses, then the theorem is false.

00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:50.270
All right, so let's rotate this picture here and arrive at the mean value theorem.

00:54:56.770 --> 00:55:08.610
Let F from AB to R be continuous.

00:55:08.610 --> 00:55:17.170
So, let's continue this on the closed interval AB, differentiable on AB.

00:55:25.070 --> 00:55:39.310
Then, there exists a C in the open interval AB such that at prime of C,

00:55:40.210 --> 00:55:54.670
right at this way, F of B minus F of A times B minus A.

00:55:58.030 --> 00:56:05.510
So, why do I refer to it as a rotated picture of a shifted kind of version of roles theorem?

00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:13.530
So, there's AB, there's F of A, F of B.

00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:20.410
And let's say that's how the function looks.

00:56:20.970 --> 00:56:29.250
Now, the slope of the line connecting F of B to F of A is exactly F of B minus F of A.

00:56:33.690 --> 00:56:38.930
So, the slope of that line is F of B minus F of A.

00:56:40.450 --> 00:56:52.470
And what we're stating is that there's a point C, so that the tangent at that point is parallel to that line.

00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:59.810
It has the same slope as the line connecting F of B to F of A.

00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:13.310
So, this theorem really does reduce to roles theorem.

00:57:13.310 --> 00:57:29.570
So, let me define a function G from AB to R, which satisfies the hypotheses of roles theorem,

00:57:30.110 --> 00:57:32.650
and will give us what we want, basically.

00:57:34.510 --> 00:57:54.050
So, G of X equals F of X minus F of B plus F of B minus F of A over B minus A times B minus X.

00:57:57.530 --> 00:58:10.190
Basically, what this function G does is it takes the function now and rotates it and shifts it down so that F kind of these two points then coincide and give you zero.

00:58:11.010 --> 00:58:12.350
All right.

00:58:16.810 --> 00:58:23.730
Then, G is continuous on the closed interval AB.

00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:27.750
Why? Because it's a sum of two continuous functions on AB.

00:58:27.970 --> 00:58:30.170
F of X is continuous on AB on AB.

00:58:30.610 --> 00:58:33.250
And this is just a constant. That's just a constant.

00:58:33.250 --> 00:58:37.550
This is a polynomial. So, G is continuous on AB.

00:58:38.510 --> 00:58:48.890
And, differentiable on AB, again, because F is, right?

00:58:49.390 --> 00:58:51.530
F is differentiable on the open interval AB.

00:58:52.410 --> 00:58:58.990
This part is differentiable everywhere, so the sum of two differentiable functions is differentiable.

00:58:58.990 --> 00:59:01.070
So, G of X is differentiable on AB.

00:59:06.330 --> 00:59:09.150
So, continuous on AB and differentiable on AB.

00:59:13.150 --> 00:59:16.790
Since I said we're going to use roles theorem, let's compute G of A.

00:59:16.790 --> 00:59:30.690
This is equal to F of A minus F of B plus F of B minus F of A over B minus A times B minus A.

00:59:30.810 --> 00:59:37.530
That cancels with that minus F of B cancels with F of B, F of A cancels with minus F of A and we get zero.

00:59:41.170 --> 00:59:45.990
And, G of B, this is even easier to see if I just stick this in.

00:59:46.070 --> 00:59:57.470
This is F of B minus F of B plus F of B minus F of A over B minus A, B minus B.

00:59:58.210 --> 01:00:01.990
And, this also equals zero. So, G of A and G of B are zero.

01:00:01.990 --> 01:00:06.750
The function is continuous on the closed interval. It's differentiable on the open interval.

01:00:09.450 --> 01:00:21.290
And, therefore, I think there's supposed to be some sort of accent over O, but I can't remember and I've forgotten it already.

01:00:21.930 --> 01:00:38.910
By roles theorem, there exists point C and AB such that zero is equal to G prime of C, which is equal to,

01:00:40.310 --> 01:00:47.930
we take G and actually compute what the derivative is at C is equal to F prime of C.

01:00:48.750 --> 01:01:03.170
That's a constant derivative of that is zero. This times this, the derivative of X evaluated at C just gives me minus F of B minus F of A times B minus A.

01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:12.190
And, that's it. Zero is equal to F prime of C minus what we want.

01:01:12.190 --> 01:01:15.850
We move that to the other side, multiply through by B minus A and we're done.

01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:42.170
Okay? Okay. So, some first very nice applications of the mean value that we want to have.

01:01:42.170 --> 01:01:45.930
So, we have a very nice theorem, which I think you've learned from calculus or the following.

01:02:12.970 --> 01:02:25.210
Let F from I to R be differentiable, meaning it's differentiable at every point in the interval I. Then we have two conclusions.

01:02:26.690 --> 01:02:46.970
F is increasing, meaning, let me recall what that means for F to be increasing. That means that if X is less than Y, this implies F of X is less than or equal to F of Y.

01:02:50.530 --> 01:03:03.030
This is equivalent to RLX and I, F prime of X is bigger than or equal to zero.

01:03:03.030 --> 01:03:09.790
So, remember F prime is the rate of change. If the rate of change is always non-negative, then F has to be growing.

01:03:10.730 --> 01:03:24.030
This says F is decreasing, meaning X is Y implies F of X is bigger than or equal to F of Y.

01:03:25.250 --> 01:03:33.970
This is equivalent to, since a function is increasing, if and only if minus F is decreasing, this inequality should flip.

01:03:52.010 --> 01:03:58.550
So, I'm going to do increasing, decreasing follows from number one by taking minus F.

01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:27.430
So, suppose first that F prime of X is always non-negative.

01:04:30.330 --> 01:04:36.510
Let A be B and I.

01:04:43.770 --> 01:05:02.270
Excuse me. We now want to show F of A is less than or equal to F of B. Then F is continuous on this smaller interval A of B. Why?

01:05:02.270 --> 01:05:13.810
Because F is differentiable at every point in I. Therefore, it is continuous at every point in I. So, in particular, on this smaller interval,

01:05:13.810 --> 01:05:34.470
it is differentiable on A, B, which implies there exists to C in A, B. So, by the mean value theorem,

01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:56.470
such that F of B minus F of A equals F prime of C times B minus A. And now, since the derivative is always non-negative, and B minus A is positive, this is bigger than or equal to 0.

01:06:03.110 --> 01:06:22.770
So, we prove in one direction. We prove in that if you like that the function's derivative being non-negative implies that the function is increasing.

01:06:22.770 --> 01:06:38.570
So, now let's prove the opposite direction. So, suppose F is increasing.

01:06:52.290 --> 01:07:06.650
Let X in be a sequence in I such that X in converges to C.

01:07:06.650 --> 01:07:32.330
So, F is equal to F of B and one of two things holds. And either, say A, RLN, X in is less than C, or B, RLN, X in is bigger than C.

01:07:32.330 --> 01:07:57.490
Now, we can always find such a sequence given a point C in the interval I. So, if I, so let's say it's a closed interval and C is in here, then we can find a sequence X in converging to C approaching C from the left.

01:08:00.110 --> 01:08:13.310
If C is one of the end points, then we can find a sequence from I approaching C from the right. That's B. And the same thing if C is over here, we can find a sequence approaching C strictly from the left.

01:08:15.270 --> 01:08:18.630
So, there always exist such a sequence.

01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:38.750
Now, this is because I is an interval.

01:08:38.750 --> 01:08:42.170
Okay.

01:08:42.170 --> 01:08:52.170
Okay.

01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:16.480
So, we have a case A. We look at F prime, then we get that F of X in is less than or equal to F of C, RLN. And let me in fact write this a little bit differently.

01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:42.100
Okay. Since, so here we're using that F is increasing. Since F is increasing, which implies for all N, F of X in minus F of C over X of N minus C.

01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:58.780
Now, this thing on top is negative, X in is less than C. So, this thing on the bottom is also negative. And therefore, this thing is positive, non-negative, I mean.

01:10:00.460 --> 01:10:11.780
And therefore, the limit must also be non-negative. But that limit is just a derivative evaluated at C.

01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:39.020
Okay. And case B is kind of similar. I mean, not kind of it is. In case B, we get that for all N, F of X in. Now, since X ends to the right of C, right of this way.

01:10:41.700 --> 01:11:00.400
This minus F of C is bigger than or equal to zero, which implies that F prime of C, which is the limit as in goes to infinity of F of X in minus F of C over X in minus C.

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:24.240
So, what's on top is non-negative. And what's on bottom is non-negative because X in is bigger than C. So, bigger than zero, bigger than zero. So, in either case, that's so, thus, in either case, we get that F prime of C is bigger than or equal to zero.

01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:38.080
And therefore, we've proven that the derivative is always non-negative. So, that's one and two.

01:11:41.480 --> 01:12:05.940
F is decreasing if and only if the function minus F is increasing, which by what we've done from part one is if and only if minus F prime of X is bigger than or equal to zero for all X and I.

01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:15.520
And then multiplying through by minus 1 gives me number 2.

01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:33.300
And so, let me make one last, I know it's taboo to write on the back part, but I'm going to do it anyways. We have the very simple theorem which now follows.

01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:57.380
Let F from I to R be differentiable. Then F is constant. So, F of X equals F of Y for all X and Y and I.

01:12:57.380 --> 01:13:26.160
F and only if the derivative is identically zero. So, F is constant if and only if F is both increasing.

01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:49.540
F is increasing and decreasing. Because it satisfies the equality sign in both of those. And by what we've done now for all this means for all X and I, F prime of X is bigger than or equal to zero.

01:13:53.680 --> 01:14:10.540
F prime of X is less than or equal to zero. And therefore, F prime of X, this is equivalent to F prime of X equals zero.

01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:18.580
Okay, so we'll stop there.
