00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.560
Okay, so we're going to continue with our discussion of the derivative.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:29.660
So, now let me recall the definition we introduced at the end of last time of the

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.720
derivative. So, let I be an interval, meaning it could be open closed, it could go

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.600
out to plus infinity, it could go out to minus infinity. But you know what an

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:47.660
interval is. And let's take a function from that interval to r. So, we say f is

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:54.740
differentiable at a point c and i. If this limit of f of x minus f of c over x

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:01.140
minus c, this difference quotient, if this limit exists, if this limit exists, we

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:12.620
also denote it by f prime of c. Okay. And last time we showed that we gave a simple

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:23.400
example that, from last time that if f of x equals alpha times x to the n, then this

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.760
function is differentiable at every c and its derivative is equal to n times alpha x

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:42.080
c to the n minus 1. Okay. Alright. Now, let's state this in an equivalent way using

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:49.140
sequences. Remember, we had this characterization of limits of functions and you know the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.220
function we're kind of looking at is f of x minus f of c over x minus c. We had this

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:03.720
equivalence between limits and limits of sequences. From last time that the limit, as,

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:10.820
let's say, g of x, as x goes to c equals l. If and only if for every sequence x have

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:19.740
been converging to c, g of x have been converges to l as n goes to infinity. So we can

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.420
restate what it means for a function to be differentiable at a point and its derivative

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:32.720
to be l, say. If and only if for every sequence x have been, with x have been not equal to

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:40.040
c for all n and converging to c, we have that l is equal to this limit as n goes to infinity

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:53.860
of now this sequence of numbers f of x n minus f of c over x of n minus c. Alright. So,

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:08.060
today the theme of today is the connection between different ability and continuity. And we

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:15.420
have kind of a very easy implication which is that if a function is differentiable at a

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:22.080
point, then it must be continuous at that point. So that's a statement of this theorem.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:33.560
If f going from an interval to r is differentiable at c, then f is also continuous at c. So,

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:41.980
let me also add in here that continuity at the point c in an interval is equivalent to

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:51.640
saying that the limit as x goes to c of f of x equals f of c. Now this is just a subtle

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:58.680
point that I want to make is that for an interval, open closed, half open, half closed,

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:06.100
whatever, any point in that interval is a cluster point of that interval. And therefore,

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.540
you know, this definition I made up there is actually meaningful and for continuity,

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.920
something being continuous at c is equivalent to, if c is a cluster point which I just said

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.660
it is, it always is, this limit equals the function evaluated at the point. Alright. So,

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:38.900
that's just kind of a subtle comment I want to make. Alright. So, how do we prove this?

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:48.200
We write the limit as x goes to c of f of x as in this way. So, essentially what I

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:54.700
do is I add and subtract f of c and then the part that is f of x minus f of c, I multiply

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.580
by x minus c and divide by x minus c which is perfectly fine because remember for a limit,

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:10.420
I never actually put, I'm never actually looking at points where x equals c. Okay. So,

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:16.720
that's fine. And so, I get this expression here. Alright. Now, what we know about limits

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:23.980
is that the limit of the sum is the sum of the limits if they are as long as all these

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.480
limits exist and the limit of the product is a product of the limits again assuming

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:35.560
all of these limits exist. And the limit as x goes to c of everything you see here do

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:43.280
exist. So, as x goes to c, this thing in brackets or in, I guess these are brackets.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:51.840
I don't know what those are called. This limit here is f prime of c as x goes to c of

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:58.780
x minus c that's just zero and f of c is just a constant. There's nothing changing with

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:04.900
x so the limit of a constant is that constant so I just get f of c. So, the limit of this

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:10.920
whole expression is f prime of c times zero plus f of c which equals f of c. So, we've

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.700
just proven that the limit as x goes to c of f of x is equal to f of c which is what

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:24.600
we wish to prove. Okay. Therefore, a function which is differentiable at a point must be

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:32.760
continuous at that point. Okay. Alright. So, as beginning mad students we're learning

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:37.260
the proofs but we're also learning questions. Alright. What types of questions to ask.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:47.600
And whenever you come across a new theorem that has one implication, one hypothesis, one

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:55.360
conclusion, then you should ask yourself does the converse hold does the conclusion also

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:02.180
imply the hypothesis. So, we've shown that f differentiable at c implies f is continuous

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:08.120
so it does the converse hold. Namely if f is continuous at a point does this imply that

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:14.660
f is differentiable at that point. Okay. And as you can see already there the answer is

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:23.100
no. Alright. I think you've probably covered this in calculus. But what's the function

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:28.880
that gives this counter example that is continuous at c but not differentiable at c? Well,

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.440
let's take for example c equals zero and let's look at the function f of x equals the

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:39.920
absolute value of x. Okay. In this function here this is continuous at every point so in

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:47.420
particular at c equals zero but it's not differentiable at c equals zero. Okay. And how do you

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:51.840
come up with and how do you do that? You know how do you show something is not differentiable.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:59.400
The simplest way is to use this remark up here by finding a sequence converging to c so

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:06.660
that the difference quotient does not have a limit as n goes to infinity. Okay. So that's

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:13.060
what we'll do here is we'll find a sequence x sub n with x sub n not equal to zero for

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:22.120
all n converging to zero such that this limit does not exist. Okay. And rather than write

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:27.660
that because the limit does not exist it doesn't make really sense for me to even write

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:43.040
that. Let me write this as saying as the sequence is divergent. So let's take a look at the

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:50.380
sequence. Okay. Now how are we going to come up with a sequence x sub n so that the

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:56.280
difference quotient does not converge? Well what's the logic? So for f of x equals the

00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:09.200
absolute value of x it looks like this. It looks like x it's equals x over here minus

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:16.960
x over here. So if you were to formally differentiate, well I mean you could actually differentiate

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:22.380
to the left of zero you get the derivative is equal to minus one to the right the derivative

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:29.380
is one. So that kind of suggests maybe there's some funny business going on at zero. So

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:36.420
let's look at a sequence which alternates between being negative and positive but is

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:45.680
converging to zero and see if that sequence will provide us with this desired sequence which

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:53.000
results in the difference quotient being divergent. So let's just take a guess. Let x n be minus

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.740
one to the n over n. It doesn't have to be this one just something that alternates back

00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:03.960
and forth would be enough. So this could be n squared here or two n or n to the 2020,

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:17.080
whatever you like. Then this is clearly always non-zero and it converges to zero. And of course

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:23.100
y converges to zero. I mean you could prove this by epsilon m definition but also you know

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:34.060
if I take the absolute value that's less than or equal to one over n and this one we know

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:42.700
converges to zero. So by squeeze theorem the thing in the middle must converge to zero and

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:50.960
we're done. Okay so we have this sequence x sub n equals minus one to the n over n which

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:59.200
is alternating back and forth. And we hope it's going to result in this difference quotient

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:04.200
being divergent as n goes to infinity. And so we compute that. Let's look at the difference

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:10.240
quotient, f of x sub n minus f of zero. f of zero is just zero. So I just get f of x sub n

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:15.720
which is the absolute value of minus one to the n over n over x sub n which is minus one

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:30.580
to the n over n. This is just equal to, so this is just equal to one over n over minus

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:39.640
one to the n over n which equals minus one to the minus n but you know minus one to the

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:48.500
minus n this is equal to the same thing as minus one to the n. So this sequence here

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:54.860
of difference quotient so f of x n minus f of zero over x n minus zero this is just equal

00:11:54.860 --> 00:12:09.620
to the sequence minus one to the n which we know is divergent doesn't have a limit. That's

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:17.440
the difference. So in summary this function f of x equals the absolute value of x is continuous

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:24.400
at c equals zero but not differentiable at c equals zero. So now a natural question that

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:34.060
people ask is, okay so a function being continuous at a point does not necessarily imply that

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:38.180
it's differentiable. But let's take a function which is continuous on the real number

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:47.480
line. Is there a point where it's differentiable? So it's already on the board but you know this

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:53.500
is not completely a crazy question to ask. For example let's go back to f of x equals

00:12:53.500 --> 00:13:00.000
the absolute value of x. This function is differentiable everywhere except zero. So there's lots of

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.700
points where this function is differentiable. It's differentiable for c positive and c negative.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:10.940
So for this continuous function there does exist points where it's differentiable. And you can

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:15.880
imagine trying to draw any kind of curve that you can on a piece of paper and you can probably find a point

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:22.900
on that curve that has a tangent. I mean if you sit there with pencil and then try to draw something very

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:28.840
jagged I mean there's still going to be little sections of your jagged curve where it has a

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:36.620
tangent. So you know I imagine this is why people thought this was the case that a continuous

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:42.820
function has to have at least one point where it's differentiable. And Varastras the godfather

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:49.860
of analysis said no. He came up with a whole class of examples of functions which are continuous

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:57.300
on the real number line but are differentiable nowhere. And this was a really surprising

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:21.200
set of examples and result to the community. And to me it's also one of the few results in this class that you really didn't see in your calculus class.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:27.660
So we're going to go through this example although in most analysis classes it's reserved for later.

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:35.740
But I think we can do it now. And so what we're going to prove is

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:54.340
that we're going to construct a function which is continuous everywhere but is differentiable nowhere.

00:14:55.100 --> 00:15:04.420
So a continuous nowhere differentiable function. And I'll even write down the function for you.

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:17.140
So what's the idea that Varastras had? It was let me, well I'm not going to write down the function just yet, but the idea of constructing such a function is that it should be highly

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:31.700
oscillatory. Imagine again you're trying to draw a picture of the graph of a function that's nowhere differentiable. You would kind of sit there and break your pencil trying to draw just kind of highly

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:45.960
oscillating function so that it never has a tangent. And that's his idea is to build a function which is highly oscillatory but not two

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.760
oscillatory so that it's still continuous at every point.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:16:13.940
Okay.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:27.180
So to start with the construction of this function which is continuous but nowhere differentiable we're going to need a few simple facts to start off with.

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:50.320
So what is so again let me write out state our goal we're going to construct a continuous function from r to r which is

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:57.320
it's nowhere differentiable.

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:17.960
So let's start off with a few simple facts about so I said that we're going to build a function which is oscillating quite a lot. There's two functions you know that oscillate cosine inside.

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:46.120
So that's those are going to be our building blocks we'll choose one of them. Let's choose co-sign say as to be our building block but anyway so let's start off with some

00:17:46.120 --> 00:18:00.240
elementary facts about co-sign so first is that for all x, y and r co-sign x minus co-sign y is less than or equal to the absolute value of x times x minus y.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:28.680
So the second is that for every real number c and for all k natural number there exists a y and c plus pi over k c plus 3 pi over k.

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:52.000
Let me label this as theorem one such that co-sign of k c that's funny minus co-sign of k y is greater than or equal to 1.

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:08.020
So both of these are simple facts about co-sign.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:27.800
So first off we did prove and maybe I should have used sine instead of co-sign in all of this but if you recall

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:49.080
from our continuity section we prove that for all x and y sine x minus sine y is less than or equal to the absolute value of x minus y for all x and y.

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:57.560
And there is a simple relation between co-sign x and sine of something and that's just a shift by pi over 2.

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:15.540
Then co-sign of x minus co-sign of y this is equal to sine x plus pi over 2 minus sine y plus pi over 2.

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:21.920
And if you like let me instead of using x and y here let me use a and b.

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:38.520
So then this is less than or equal to x plus pi over 2 minus y plus pi over 2 using this inequality.

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:53.180
So that proves number one. For number two it's just a simple fact about co-sign being two pi periodic.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:10.120
So function g of x equals co-sign k of x. This is also periodic but now what's the period it's 2 pi over k.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:30.940
Now this interval has linked to pi except it's missing the point c plus pi over 2 and c plus 3 pi over k.

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:56.740
So if I look at the image of,

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:15.220
then so this function g of x equals co-sign k of x if I look at the image of this interval,

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:30.080
this will contain all of the real numbers between minus 1 and 1.

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:36.580
So this is a interval of length 2 pi over k.

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:47.560
So cosine k x is 2 pi over k periodic so I should get everything between minus 1 and 1 except possibly the value at the endpoints.

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:59.660
So take away and the value at the endpoints is minus cosine kc.

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:20.320
Because cosine of k times c plus pi is equal to pi over k is equal to cosine of kc plus pi and cosine of something plus pi is equal to minus cosine of that thing.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:35.100
So the image of this set by cosine kx contains everything between minus 1 and 1 except for possibly the end point.

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:44.180
So this really only happens at cosine of k times c equals 1.

00:23:44.180 --> 00:24:09.300
So then if cosine of kc is

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:34.220
bigger than or equal to 0, then we choose y in this interval c plus pi over kc plus 3 pi over k.

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.960
Let's write it this way.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:25:15.880
So if this thing is bigger than or equal to 0, then we choose y in this interval so that cosine of ky equals minus 1.

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:38.460
And if cosine kc is less than 0, then we choose y so that cosine of ky equals 1.

00:25:45.340 --> 00:26:01.520
So again, just to get an idea, I'm quibbling over a minor point, the fact that we have to take away possibly the point where possibly the value of cosine kc.

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:12.780
Let's erase this for a minute and let's imagine that the range of this guy, I mean it's a 2 pi over k periodic interval.

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:16.500
So this should basically cover all values between minus 1 and 1.

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:26.340
So cosine of kc will either be plus or minus, so if it's non-negative, then I can find a y in this interval since it's 2 pi over k periodic.

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:29.100
So that cosine of ky equals minus 1.

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:40.780
And since this is non-negative and this is equal to minus 1, the difference between these two and absolute value will be greater than or equal to 1.

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:55.180
Now, if cosine of kc is less than 0, then again, since this interval contains minus 1 to 1, it's 2 pi over k periodic, we choose a y so that cosine of ky equals 1.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:27:03.120
And then this is negative, this is 1, so the difference between something negative and 1 is greater than or equal to 1.

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:06.500
And that's the proof.

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:18.640
I made kind of a mess of it, but this is very easy to understand if you just draw a picture really.

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:25.720
So let's continue.

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:41.780
And again, what these two parts of this theorem say is that cosine can be quite oscillatory if you insert a k here.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:49.880
Because the difference between this interval is actually quite small.

00:27:50.340 --> 00:28:01.160
The length of this interval is 2 pi over k. If k is very large, that's a very small interval, yet somehow we can find two points which differ by at least one in value if we plug them into the function.

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:07.020
But cosine is not too wild because it satisfies this bound.

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:23.980
So these two are going to be the ingredients in that idea I said at the start that we're going to build a function which oscillates, which is quite oscillatory, but it's not too oscillatory that it's still continuous.

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:35.580
And we're going to build our function out of cosine kx where k is going to be changing.

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:46.800
So I'm going to need one more very simple fact, so this one I won't mess up too much, which is the following.

00:28:46.800 --> 00:29:01.600
For all a, b, c, and r, the absolute value of a plus b plus c, this is bigger than or equal to the absolute value of a minus the absolute value of c.

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:06.980
And the proof of this is just to use the triangle inequality twice.

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:18.100
We have the absolute value of a, this is equal to a plus b plus c minus b plus c.

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:31.240
And this is less than or equal to, by the triangle inequality, the absolute value of a plus b plus c plus the absolute value of minus times b plus c.

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:33.580
But that minus goes away with the absolute value.

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:39.860
And then I use the triangle inequality one more time here to get.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.900
And then if I subtract, what do I want to do that?

00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:12.440
And so if I subtract this side over to the other side of this inequality, I get the statement of the theorem.

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:13.760
All right?

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:22.320
So now we're going to introduce, call this theorem 2.

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:29.620
Now let me introduce the guest of honor.

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:46.100
So first, I have a following claim for all x and r, the series given by sum from n equals 0 to infinity.

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:52.220
And instead of n, I'm going to use k cosine 160k x.

00:30:52.360 --> 00:31:04.420
So here's our very oscillatory guy over 4 to the k is absolutely convergent.

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:08.420
All right?

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:11.640
So for each x and r, this series converges absolutely.

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:13.220
So it spits out a real number.

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:17.920
So I can define a function in terms of this series.

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:34.320
Let f from r to r be defined by f prime f of x is just the number that I get.

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:51.500
And I stick in x to the series, which is meaningful because for all x, this series converges absolutely.

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:53.420
So this is just a function.

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:56.580
I put in x. I get out a real number.

00:31:57.180 --> 00:32:09.240
Then the claim is f is bounded and continuous.

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:16.840
So this is going to be our function, which is continuous, but nowhere differentiable.

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:23.860
As you can see, it's built out of a bunch of very oscillatory functions.

00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:25.660
Cosine of 160k x.

00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:28.040
This is just a really big number here.

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:34.600
And as I said, when we were talking about this theorem here, each one of those pieces is very oscillatory.

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:40.840
A very small interval, it oscillates between two values that differ by at least one.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.620
And so all of these guys are oscillatory.

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:53.880
And they're oscillatory on smaller and smaller intervals.

00:32:54.500 --> 00:33:01.660
And somehow we're adding them all up in a way to get a function that's oscillatory on arbitrarily small intervals.

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:03.540
And therefore, it will not be differentiable.

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:08.100
So.

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:19.120
The proof of one is very easy.

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:21.720
We just use a comparison principle.

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:29.280
Cosine of 160k times x over 4 to the k.

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:34.900
This is less than or equal to because cosine of no matter what you plug in is bounded by 1.

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:37.840
This is always bounded by 1 over 4 to the k.

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:45.960
And therefore, by the comparison principle, we get that.

00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:57.860
This series is convergent.

00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:02.660
And therefore, the original series is absolutely convergent.

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:07.520
So each of these is bounded by 1 over 4 to the k.

00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:09.900
This series converges.

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:11.760
This is a geometric series.

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:16.380
Therefore, by the comparison principle, this series converges.

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:22.060
So now we have this function defined by this series.

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:29.040
No, this is not a power series because a power series involves polynomials and x.

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:32.740
This is cosine of x or number times x.

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:34.540
So let's show it's bounded.

00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:38.780
The same proof actually that we gave here shows it's bounded.

00:34:40.900 --> 00:35:08.760
x, b and r, then f of x equals this is equal to the limit as x.

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:15.780
And goes to infinity of this sum.

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:23.620
And now for absolute values, this limit pulls out.

00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:34.380
Whenever the limit exists, the limit of the absolute value equals the absolute value of the limit.

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:50.760
And this is less than or equal to the limit as n goes to infinity of bringing the epsilon.

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:54.960
So by the triangle inequality, this is just a finite sum.

00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:58.060
So I can bring the absolute values in.

00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:07.860
And I get sum from k equals 0 to m of cosine 160k x over 4 to the k, absolute value.

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:20.620
And this is less than or equal to limit as m goes to infinity of sum k equals 0 to m of 4 to the minus k again,

00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:23.520
because cosine of anything is bounded by 1.

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:30.420
And this equals 4 thirds.

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:35.380
This is just a sum from k equals 0 to infinity of 4 to the minus k.

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:40.200
So this function is always bounded by 4 thirds.

00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:50.580
So the function is bounded. Let's now show it's continuous.

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:09.780
To show a function's continuous, remember we have that other characterization of continuity that

00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:14.260
functions continuous at a point if and only if for every sequence converging to that point,

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:18.540
f of xn converges to f of c.

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:33.520
So before I start writing all this down, let's see, vnr, and let xn be a sequence converging to c.

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:46.840
So what we want to show is that limit as m goes to infinity of f of xn minus f of c in absolute value equals 0.

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:52.080
That's the same as saying the limit as n goes to infinity of f of xn equals f of c.

00:37:55.940 --> 00:38:00.280
Now, f is a bounded function.

00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:09.680
So this sequence, f of xn minus f of c is an absolute value, is a bounded sequence.

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:10.940
So it has a limb soup.

00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:22.300
And we did an exercise on the assignment that the limit of a sequence equals 0 if and only if the limb soup equals 0.

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:46.960
So the equivalent leave will show that limb soup of f of x to the n minus f of c equals 0.

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:50.000
This thing always exists for a bounded sequence.

00:38:51.180 --> 00:39:00.760
Just one of the reasons which is what makes limb soup so useful is that they do always exist.

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:07.860
So if we show that this limb soup equals 0, then this is equivalent to showing this limit equals 0.

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:16.980
Again, this was an exercise where you can take it as the limb inf of something that's not negative is always bigger than or equal to 0.

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:24.660
So if we show this is equal to 0, we would have 0 as less than or equal to the limb inf of this thing as less than or equal to the limb soup, which equals 0.

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:28.020
And therefore, the limb inf equals the limb soup equals 0.

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:32.360
So that's another way of seeing that this is equivalent to this.

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:39.180
So we're going to show this at the limb soup of f of x to the n minus f of c equals 0.

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:54.740
So that might be a little tough, but what we can show and what we will show is we'll give ourself a little room.

00:39:54.740 --> 00:40:09.620
We'll show that for all epsilon positive, the limb soup of f of x of n minus f of c, which is a non-negative number, is less than epsilon.

00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:22.820
So this is a fixed number, not a negative number, which is always smaller than, put less than or equal to that, which is smaller than any number that I want, and therefore it has to be 0.

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:30.140
So improving thus, let's soup.

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:44.060
So just to recap, we want to show we have a sequence converging to c.

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:47.020
We want to show that f of x n converges to f of c.

00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:53.920
Another way of stating that is that this limit of the absolute value between these two converges to 0.

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:56.940
That's again an equivalent way of stating the limit.

00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:19.360
And in another assignment, we proved that for a sequence of non-negative numbers, or if you like just for a sequence of numbers, it converges to 0 if and only if the limb soup of the absolute value converges to 0.

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:26.660
But this is a sequence of non-negative numbers, this absolute value of f of x n minus f of c. So this is equivalent to this.

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:35.000
So this thing we want to show is equivalent to this thing right below it.

00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:44.680
Now rather than show directly that this limit, limb soup equals 0, we're going to show that for all epsilon positive, it's less than or equal to that small number.

00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:51.660
And therefore proving that it's 0 because it's a non-negative number, smaller than every positive number.

00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:58.560
Okay, so this is our goal to show this limb soup is less than epsilon.

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:08.220
All right, so let epsilon be positive.

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:14.400
We're now going to prove that that limb soup is less than epsilon.

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:43.000
So first off, let M naught be a natural number such that the sum from k equals M naught plus 1 to infinity of 4 to the minus k is less than epsilon over 2.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:50.540
So this series here, this is a convergent series if I go from k equals 0 to infinity.

00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:52.160
Okay.

00:42:53.900 --> 00:43:07.280
And you know, we have this koshi criterion for convergent series which can be equivalently stated as for all M zero and natural number, there exists or for all epsilon, there exists.

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:13.380
So first off, okay, rather than go through all that, we can actually just compute this.

00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:42.560
That the left hand side equals 4 to the minus M naught minus 1 times sum from L equals 0 to infinity 4 to the minus L, which equals 4 thirds or to the minus M naught minus 1.

00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:55.620
So if M naught is chosen very large, this is 4 to the minus M zero.

00:43:55.840 --> 00:44:01.040
So this is like I can write this as 1 third over 1 fourth.

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:14.400
And as long as M zero is chosen very large, I can always make this very small, that's the left side over there, so I can always find a M zero so that this is the case.

00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:15.440
Okay.

00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:24.260
Okay.

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:35.540
And now we compute the lymph soup of f of x in minus f of x.

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:41.420
We split this up into two pieces. This is equal to lymph soup.

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:54.720
Then two parts, sum from k equals 0 to M zero of cosine of 160 k x in minus.

00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:23.720
So each of these is defined in terms of sum, so I'm going to break the sum up into up to M zero and then everything past M zero, this is equal to 1 over 4 k times cosine 160 k x in minus cosine 160 k x plus sum from k equals 0 to 1.

00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:30.420
M zero plus 1 to infinity 1 over 4 k.

00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:33.200
Same thing.

00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:44.400
Absolute value.

00:45:45.920 --> 00:46:00.300
And now we use a triangle inequality in the fact that lymph soups preserve inequality, so the absolute value of this thing is less than or equal to the sum of the absolute values.

00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:04.800
And the lymph soup of those sequences is less than or equal to the sum of the lymph soups.

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:10.780
That was another exercise from an assignment or you did something similar with the lymph imp.

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:25.520
So this is less than or equal to lymph soup of now I use the triangle inequality sum from k equals 0 to M zero for minus k.

00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:36.680
So I'm going to write x in minus cosine 160 k x in minus cosine 160 k.

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:41.280
Oh dear.

00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:49.420
So I've been writing x, I'm into write c. Sorry about that.

00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:59.420
C, C, C, C, C.

00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:20.540
And then same thing in these brackets here.

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:29.080
Now, let's see how it might keep that.

00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:41.340
All right, so we have that this lymph soup of x sub n minus f of c is less than or equal to the lymph soup of this guy plus the lymph soup of this guy.

00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:58.200
And now I'm going to use the triangle inequality again bringing the absolute values inside of the sums, which is perfectly valid even for the infinite sum by the same argument I use basically over there.

00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:26.200
This is less than or equal to the lymph soup as n goes to infinity of minus cosine of 160 k, C and soup plus.

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:41.920
And then the absolute value of the same thing.

00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:51.360
Now, I applied the triangle inequality to that.

00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:08.500
Now, cosine of anything is always bounded by one.

00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:19.780
So this is bounded by, first off, let me come back to this second one, M zero is fixed. Remember, this is not changing within.

00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:22.280
It's just fixed. It depended only on epsilon.

00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:30.620
So M zero is fixed and this is less than or equal to lymph soup of n.

00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:42.200
And now we use what we know about cosine, that cosine of something minus cosine of something else is bounded by the difference in the argument.

00:49:42.200 --> 00:50:11.320
So this is bounded by minus four to the minus k times 160 k x n minus 160 k, C plus lymph soup of k equals M zero plus one to infinity four minus k times two.

00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:21.960
Now, there's no n left here. So this is really just now equal to that.

00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:29.060
And we chose M zero so that this quantity here is less than epsilon over two. So times two, this is less than epsilon.

00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:42.480
So this is less than or equal to lymph soup, sum from k equals zero to M zero of forty k.

00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:45.140
Now, again, this is just a fixed number.

00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:55.220
The lymph soup is in n. This is just a fixed number times x of n minus C.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:01.880
The difference in this is just equal to 160 k times four to the minus k that's forty k.

00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:07.880
And then we chose M zero so that this quantity over here is less than epsilon.

00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:16.020
And now, as n goes to infinity, x of n is converging to C.

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:31.340
So this thing here converges to zero equals times zero plus epsilon equals epsilon.

00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:39.660
So, to me, this is a real first proof of analysis.

00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:47.280
We're kind of using everything that you've been exposed to up to this point to prove a really deep theorem.

00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:54.280
So, go through this slowly, but there's not too much...

00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:03.400
The estimates are not all that tricky once you have them in front of you.

00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:11.800
So we've shown that for all epsilon, this lymph soup is less than or equal to epsilon because remember, we ended with epsilon here.

00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:18.840
But we started off estimating this lymph soup here.

00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:20.820
Okay?

00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:31.880
Now, we're in a position to prove the final theorem that we want to prove, and this is due to virus loss.

00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:57.020
The function, which we've been studying, f of x equals sum from k equals zero to infinity, cosine 160 k x over four to the k.

00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:06.540
There's nowhere differentiable.

00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:08.120
Okay?

00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:17.880
Alright, so, you know, with everything we've done so far, so we know this function is continuous.

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:19.240
We've proven that.

00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:26.440
So this theorem provides you with an example of a function which is continuous, but nowhere differentiable.

00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:39.660
And with what we have on the board, namely, you know, the key parts are going to be, what's in that first theorem there.

00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:46.140
And just trying to win equality we have over here, we'll be able to prove this.

00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:51.140
So, in fact, let me give myself a little space.

00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:15.420
And I'm going to state the theorem two from over there because I need some space to write in a minute for all A, B, C, the absolute value of A plus P plus C is bigger than or equal to.

00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:20.980
So, let me give A minus absolute value of B minus the absolute value of C.

00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:22.280
Alright?

00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:43.260
Alright, so let me re-summarize it already.

00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:44.600
So, let me show you what we've done up to this point.

00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:50.680
We've shown that this function here is well defined, absolutely, the series is always absolutely convergent.

00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:56.920
And therefore, this function is bounded and, or we also proved that it's bounded and continuous.

00:54:57.740 --> 00:54:59.200
Right? That was the previous theorem.

00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:04.820
So, this function is bounded and continuous and we're going to prove it's nowhere differentiable.

00:55:06.140 --> 00:55:07.780
And again, what's the idea?

00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:14.360
The idea is that we've built it out of functions which are highly oscillatory at smaller and smaller scales.

00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:20.360
So, somehow this function is highly oscillatory at every scale.

00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:32.780
And if you have a function which is highly oscillatory of every scale, if some of you have heard of Brownian motion, which is a function which is a path,

00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:43.140
which is highly oscillatory, then that function will not be differentiable anywhere.

00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:52.380
Okay? So, proof.

00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:57.000
Let's see, be any real number.

00:55:57.980 --> 00:56:03.580
And what we're going to do, just as in, when we looked at f of x equal the absolute value of x, we're going to construct.

00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:24.740
Or find a sequence, x of n such that, x of n does not equal c for all n, x n converges to c.

00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:44.000
And the sequence, f of x of n, minus f of c over x of n minus c, in fact, is divergent but will go even further is unbounded.

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:50.920
Okay? And therefore the sequence cannot converge. And therefore the function is not differentiable at c.

00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:52.480
Okay?

00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:17.160
So, we're going to use theorem one to find the sequence by theorem one, namely part two,

00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:31.140
for all n, the natural number, there exists the x of n such that what x of n is n, this interval of the form,

00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:48.560
so c plus pi over 160 n is less than x is less than c plus 3 pi over 160 n.

00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:51.120
Okay?

00:57:58.020 --> 00:58:08.540
And cosine of 160 n, x of n, minus cosine of 160 n, c is bigger than or equal to 1.

00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:10.920
Okay?

00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:20.860
So, let me call these two properties a and b.

00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:35.320
So, another way of writing a is we could have instead written by subtracting c across the board,

00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:47.000
that x of n minus c is between pi over 160 n and 3 pi over 160 n.

00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:59.060
Okay? So, by a, brawl n, x of n does not equal to c because their difference is bounded below by a positive number.

00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:05.820
I mean their difference is actually positive and it's non-zero, so.

00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:24.820
And by this quiz theorem, you know, again, if you like putting the c on both sides, we get that x of n converges to c.

00:59:24.820 --> 00:59:31.360
So, this will be our sequence, our bad sequence for which the difference quotient is unbounded.

00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:31.680


00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:40.400
So, in fact, let me write this out a little bit more.

00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:58.800
And x of n minus c, which is equal to x of n minus c because this is positive, is less than 3 pi over 160 n.

00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:07.940
Okay? And this goes to zero, therefore the absolute value of x n minus c converges to zero and therefore x of n converges to c.

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:09.920
Okay?

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:22.860
All right. Now, it's a lesson. The number of times I have to write cosine 160 k.

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:33.260
Let fk of x be cosine 160 k x over 4 to the k.

01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:42.760
So, f of x is equal to the sum and k equal to zero of fk of x.

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:44.180
All right?

01:00:52.920 --> 01:01:01.440
And now what we're going to do is we're going to find a lower bound on the absolute value of f of x n minus f of c over x of n minus c.

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:27.120
So, now, find a lower bound on, okay?

01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:37.140
It's like I find a lower bound on this absolute value which is getting large as large as I wish and that proves that this sequence is unbounded.

01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:38.000
And I'm done.

01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:52.600
Okay?

01:01:55.220 --> 01:02:03.500
So, let's look at the absolute value of f of x n minus f of c.

01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:14.260
Let's just write this in a few different ways or not a few different ways, but let's split it up as a sum.

01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:19.020
So, all of these guys are equal to sum of f of k.

01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:28.800
So, I have the int one.

01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:32.900
So, remember, f of k, this is just one of these building blocks.

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:43.100
Plus, sum from k equals zero to n minus one.

01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:06.420
Plus, put x here and min to write c.

01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:07.780
Okay?

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:23.740
And so, I'm going to let a sub n be this first number, b sub n be the second number, including the sum.

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:27.160
And this will be c sub n.

01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:34.060
So, this is equal to a sub n plus b sub n plus c sub n.

01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:38.700
Okay? And now, I'm going to use that triangle inequality I proved.

01:03:42.180 --> 01:04:04.040
Then, f of x sub n minus f of c is greater than or, which is equal to a sub n plus b sub n plus c sub n is bigger than or equal to a sub n minus b sub n minus c sub n.

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:10.140
Okay? Now, a sub n, this is going to be, this is just the difference between these guys.

01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:11.880
This is bounded below by one.

01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:14.540
All right? So, it's kind of large.

01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:18.360
Not one, but one over four to the n.

01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:21.860
These other guys will prove are very small compared to the a sub n.

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:29.380
And then, this lower bound, this upper bound we have on x sub n minus c will be the nail in the coffin, as we see.

01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:34.020
So, our goal is now to estimate from below a sub n.

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:38.740
Remember, we're trying to find a lower bound for this quantity over x sub n minus c.

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:41.740
So, we need to estimate these things from below.

01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:46.880
Or this sum from below. That means we need to estimate this from below.

01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:50.720
And then, b sub n and c sub n since they have minus signs from above.

01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:51.680
Okay?

01:04:56.520 --> 01:05:15.240
Now, by b, a sub n, which is equal to four to minus n cosine 160 in x sub n minus cosine 160 to the nc.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:24.620
This is, remember how we chose these x sub n's?

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:30.440
This is bounded above by one or bounded below by one.

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:38.860
So, this is bigger than or equal to four to the minus n.

01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:40.540
All right? So, that's a sub n.

01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:44.220
Now, let's look at how big b sub n is.

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:50.760
Now, we want to bound this from above because when it hits the minus sign,

01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:55.340
this will flip the inequality and we'll have that this will be bounded from below by something.

01:05:56.200 --> 01:06:04.080
So, the absolute value of b sub n, okay, that's equal to sum from k equals zero to n minus one.

01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:16.360
Now, of fk of x sub n minus f of c k of c.

01:06:18.780 --> 01:06:22.700
And bringing the absolute values inside by the triangle inequality,

01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:31.820
this is less than or equal to sum from k equals n minus one of f of fk of x sub n minus fk of c.

01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:52.680
And now, so this is equal to sum from k equals zero to n minus one four to the minus k cosine 160 k x of n minus cosine of 160 k.

01:06:53.700 --> 01:07:04.480
And now, we use theorem one number two, or number one, I'm sorry, theorem one part one.

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:12.360
So, this is theorem one, one.

01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:20.000
The difference in these is bounded by 160 k times the difference in those two.

01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:24.120
So, that's...

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:35.100
And now, these things we can sum up in closed form will actually x sub n minus c.

01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:40.040
We proved is less than three pi over 160 n.

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:54.680
So, this is less than sum from k equals zero n minus one forty k.

01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:59.720
And this equals three pi over 160 n.

01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:04.060
Now, sum from k equals zero to n minus one forty k.

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:09.880
We use this formula for summing a geometric sum.

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:12.140
This is equal to...

01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:22.260
This is equal to forty to the n minus one over thirty nine.

01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:26.560
And...

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.600
Which is less than...

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:31.320
Okay, so take away the one.

01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:40.360
This is one over thirteen four to minus n times pi.

01:08:44.940 --> 01:08:51.920
And that's less than pi is less than four, so plus one.

01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:58.980
Okay, so let me summarize this.

01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:13.100
This is less than or equal to one over thirteen four to minus n plus one.

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:18.240
Okay.

01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:28.920
Now, for the last box, this is less the absolute value of c sub n.

01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:33.140
Absolute value is less than or equal to...

01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:38.700
Now, we just kind of do a brutal estimate.

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:49.200
We bring the absolute values inside.

01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:51.360
Okay, so this is equal.

01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:58.120
So, just as we had before with the v sub n's except now we're summing from k equals n plus one to infinity.

01:09:58.120 --> 01:09:59.680
We brought the absolute values inside.

01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:02.740
And then let's use the triangle inequality on that.

01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:16.640
Remember, fk is equal to cosine of one sixty k times x over four to the k.

01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:22.620
So, that's no matter what you plug in, that's bounded by four one over four to the k.

01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:25.460
Okay.

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:33.040
Okay.

01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:38.120
And now this we can actually sum.

01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:51.520
This is equal to four to the minus n minus one times sum from l equals zero to infinity of four to the minus l.

01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:56.360
And one is this equal.

01:10:56.680 --> 01:11:06.380
This equals two times four to the minus n minus one times four thirds equals two thirds for the minus n.

01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:09.920
Okay.

01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:18.660
So, my board works getting a little shoddy but it'll be okay.

01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:28.900
IE, we've proven that the absolute value of c sub n is bounded by two thirds for the minus n.

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:32.060
Okay.

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:38.320
All right.

01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:48.740
So, combining everything that we've done, we've shown that f of x sub n minus f of c,

01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:52.500
which remember is equal to bounded below by,

01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:09.800
this is bounded below by a sub n. Remember, so the first box is bounded by four to the minus n.

01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:20.120
So, first off, everything, the a sub n's, b sub n's, c sub n's, they all have some four to the minus n involved.

01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:25.160
I have them to the minus n for b. Covering it up.

01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:36.160
Four to the minus n. So, this is one coming from the a sub n's and minus four over 13 coming from the b sub n's.

01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:45.000
Minus two thirds coming from the c sub n's.

01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:59.300
And if you do the arithmetic, this is four to the minus n, one over 39.

01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:09.520
Okay. So, f of x sub n minus f of c is bounded from below by four to the minus n times one over 39.

01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:17.580
Now, I just divide by x sub n minus c, which is bounded above by three pi over 160 n.

01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:32.600
And therefore, when I take reciprocals, I get that.

01:13:33.620 --> 01:13:47.520
I get that the absolute value of f of x sub n minus f of c over x sub n minus c is bounded from above by one over x sub n.

01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:57.320
Minus c times four to the minus n, one over 39, which is bounded below by now inserting this estimate here.

01:13:57.820 --> 01:14:03.260
I get 40 n over, I think that's 117 pi.

01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:19.640
Yes. And therefore, the absolute value of the difference quotient is bounded below by 40 to the n over some fixed number.

01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:27.100
And this thing on the right hand side is unbounded, as n gets, as n varies from one to infinity.

01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:35.580
And therefore, the absolute value of this difference quotient is unbounded.

01:14:48.540 --> 01:14:50.320
Which finishes the proof.

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:59.380
All right, so we've done some things, maybe a few things that you haven't seen in calculus course.

01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:02.220
Definitely haven't seen this most likely.

01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:15.700
And really, this is the first result that involves a lot of math that we've covered up to this point to prove a very non-trivial and deep theorem that

01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:23.320
that different ability is a bit of a miracle.

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:26.100
It's a miracle when it happens.

01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:27.220
Okay, we'll stop there.
