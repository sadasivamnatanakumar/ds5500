00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:21.900
Okay, so let's finish the proof that we started at the end of the lecture last time.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:29.640
I usually don't end lectures in the middle of a proof, but since this lecture and

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.460
lecture before, we'll come to you at the same time.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.600
I didn't feel so bad about it.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.980
All right, so we're trying to prove this theorem that if there's a rational

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.180
number so that it's equal to the supremum of this set, then x is bigger than or

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.340
equal to 1, and it's where gives me 2.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:01:00.720
Okay, and so far what we've shown is that if I have an element a rational number

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.800
that is given by the supremum, then it's bigger than or equal to 1, and x squared

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.400
has to be bigger than or equal to 2.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.600
And so now we would like to show that in fact x squared equals 2.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.160
Okay, now since x squared is bigger than or equal to 2, it's either equal to 2

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.340
or bigger than 2, and we want to show that the second possibility is not possible.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.680
Okay, so we're going to prove that the second possibility is not possible by

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.460
contradiction.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.380
So let's assume that the thing that we say cannot happen does happen, and

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.700
we're going to derive a false statement.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.140
Okay, so

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:53.440
find h, this is going to be x squared minus 2 over 2x.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:05.100
All right, and so note a couple of things that since x squared is bigger than 2,

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:16.380
this implies h is bigger than 0, which implies x minus h is less than x.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.740
Okay, so what is the contradiction going to be?

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:27.440
It's going to be that this element x minus h is in fact an upper bound for the set e,

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.360
and this will contradict the fact that x is the supremum.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.120
In other words, it's the least upper bound for the set e.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.780
There's no upper bound for e that can be less than x.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.680


00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.840
All right, so

00:02:47.680 --> 00:03:04.020
we now prove that x minus h is an upper bound for the set e.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.720
Okay, now let's take a look at

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.100
x minus h squared.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:36.340
Then this is equal to x squared minus 2x h plus h squared.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:51.480
Now just given by, if we just plug in what h is, this is equal to x squared minus x squared minus 2.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.980
So that's putting h in, and then the 2x here cancels with the 2x there.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:03.360
So I just get x squared minus 2 plus h squared, which equals 2 plus h squared.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.820
Now remember, h is a positive number, so 2 plus a positive number, this is bigger than 2.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.980
Okay, so x minus h squared is bigger than 2.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.420
So now I'm going to use this to show that x minus h is an upper bound for e.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.000
So let q be an e.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.980
q squared is less than 2.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:51.500
Then I have q squared is less than 2, which is less than x minus h squared by what we just proved here.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:05:03.420
So let me write this out, or just summarize that what we proved here was x minus h squared is bigger than 2.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:16.080
So we have q squared is less than 2 is less than x minus h squared, so that means 0 is bigger than x minus h squared minus q squared.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.060
Okay, q squared is less than this, so then if I just subtracted, I get this inequality.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:38.080
So that implies that 0 is bigger than, now this is the difference of 2 squared, so I can write this as x minus h plus q minus q.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:06:04.400
Okay, now if I just write out what x minus h is using the definition of h, this is equal to x squared plus 2 over 2x plus q over x minus h minus q.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.960
Okay, now the product of these two numbers is positive.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.140
This number is positive because q is positive.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:33.880
Okay, and so that means there's some is positive, so I have something positive times this, so I can divide by this positive thing.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:48.100
And keep the inequality, so that implies that 0 is less than x minus h minus q, which implies that q is less than x minus h.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:57.300
Alright, so we started off with an element of e, an arbitrary element of e, and we proved that q is less than x minus h.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:17.340
Thus, for all q and e, q is less than x minus h, which implies that x minus h is an upper bound for e.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:32.340
But, so let me keep that board for now.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:37.080
I'll write the last sentence or so of this proof.

00:07:55.980 --> 00:08:06.980
So, we stated that x minus h is an upper bound for e, which implies since x is the supremum of e, it should be less than or equal to all upper bounds.

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:31.420
Which implies h is less than or equal to 0, but this is a direct contradiction to h being a positive number.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:38.420
So, this is the false statement we ultimately prove.

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:53.480
Okay, but the idea is that if x squared is bigger than 2, you can find a lower bound, I mean an upper bound, which is strictly smaller than x, which contradicts the fact that x is the greatest lower bound for e.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:09:10.420
Okay, so, but remember what was our original assumption to begin with in this line of reasoning, that was that x squared is bigger than 2.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.580
And that concludes the proof.

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:18.220


00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:46.140
Okay, so, this was a statement about just if I have some element that's a rational number and it's equal to the supremum that it's square has to be 2.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:53.100
Now, I'm going to prove that basically no such element exists.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:10:03.380
And therefore, that the rational numbers do not have the least upper bound property, which was the discussion above those two lines in that circle on that board up there.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:14.180
So, what's the theorem we're going to prove the set e as before?

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:21.240
So, this is a rational number such that q is bigger than 0.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:28.240
q squared is less than 2.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:50.660
It is bounded above and as no supremum in q.

00:10:52.620 --> 00:11:11.940
Okay, so I'm not just saying that, so this set e sits inside my kind of ordered set, which is my universe q, I'm not saying that it doesn't have a supremum in e, I'm saying it doesn't have a supremum in the universe where it sits.

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:23.820
Okay, and therefore, the rational numbers do not have the least upper bound property because this set is set, which is bounded above and has no supremum in q.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:35.580
So, the first thing I want to show is that this set e is bounded above.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:52.680
Let q be in e, then q squared is less than 2, which is less than 4.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:12:05.780
So, this tells me 4 minus q squared is positive, which tells me 2 minus q times 2 plus q is positive.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:26.140
Now, since 2 is positive and q is positive, 2 plus q is positive, so I can divide both sides of this inequality by this, 2 plus q without changing the inequality, which implies I'm just going to flip this inequality.

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:36.640
Thus, for all q and e, q is less than 2.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:41.560
Okay, so 2 is an upper bound for the set e.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:03.000
Okay, so that proves that the set e is bounded above.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:25.840
So, now I'm going to prove that no supremum exists by using the previous theorem, which says if I have a supremum, then it square must be 2.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:52.180
Okay, so now we show that the soup of e does not exist, and we do this by contradiction.

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:19.820
Now, I know it seems like a lot of the proofs are doing are by contradiction.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:39.060
But, you know, proof by contradiction is very tempting because it at least gets you going somewhere.

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:48.400
If you can assume not, then you get to the next step, which, you know, this assumption implies something else and hopefully you can keep going until you arrive at something false.

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:53.560
But many theorems that you want to prove can be done directly.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:15:00.180
All right, but not this one. Now we show the supremum of the set does not exist.

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:12.840
So, by contradiction, so we will assume that such a supremum does exist.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:35.340
So, suppose the supremum exists and call it x.

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:37.840
So, x is the supremum of the set.

00:15:42.540 --> 00:16:00.140
Okay, so by the previous theorem, since x is an element of the rational numbers, which, whose square gives me, which is the supremum of the set, then x is bigger than or equal to 1 and it squares 2.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:15.040
By the previous theorem, x is bigger than or equal to 1 and x squared equals 2.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:24.520
Okay, in fact, x has to be bigger than 1.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.380
It cannot equal 1 because the square would give me 1 not 2.

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:35.480
All right, so I can make that statement that x is in fact bigger than 1, not just bigger than or equal to.

00:16:41.080 --> 00:17:02.780
Okay, so thus, since x is a rational, there exists m in natural numbers such that m is bigger than n.

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:09.220
And x is equal to m over n.

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:20.780
Okay, so that's what it means for x to be a rational number and for it to be bigger than 1.

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:37.040
Thus, there exists an n such that n times x is a natural number.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:43.960
All right, just multiplying through by n, that means that n times x is equal to m, which is a natural number.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:18:01.000
So let s be the set of natural numbers so that when I multiply x by k, I get a natural number.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.460
And so what we've shown just based on our assumption is that s is non-empty, right?

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.180
Because n is an s.

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:27.100
Now, this is a subset of natural numbers, so by the well-ordering property of n,

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:53.760
this set s has a least element, which we'll call k0 ns.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:10.940
Okay, so what I'm going to show is that in fact this little guy k0 is not in fact the least element of this set s,

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:14.620
which would contradict exactly how it's defined.

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:31.920
So, to find k1 to be k0x minus k0.

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:45.440
And note this is an integer. Why? Because k0 times x, so k0 is in the set s, meaning k0 times x is a natural number, so it's an integer.

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:52.700
k0 is a natural number, so the difference of two integers is again an integer.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:20:00.660
So k0 is a natural number, k0 times x is a natural number, so the difference of two natural numbers gives me an integer.

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:05.920
But in fact, it's a natural number.

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.240
So, it's a natural number.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:33.020
Okay, so let's go over here.

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:56.820
Okay, so far we have that k1 is a natural number, and I'm going to prove that k1 is actually less than k0.

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:14.220
So, since x squared equals 2, I should say,

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:26.780
okay, so let's write it this way. Since x squared is equal to 2, this implies that

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:40.360
4 minus x squared is positive, I mean I just wrote down 2, 4 minus x squared is just 2.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:55.820
So, this tells me taking the difference, 2 minus x times 2 plus x is positive, 2 and x are positive, so I can divide this inequality through by this term and maintain the inequality which implies 2 minus x is positive.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:05.900
And therefore, x is less than 2. Okay, so x is less than 2.

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:19.440
Then k1, which remember is k0 times x minus 1, is less than k0, so k0 is a natural number, it's positive.

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:48.140
x minus 1 is bounded by 2 minus 1 equals k0. Okay, so what we've shown is so far is that this number k1 is a natural number, and it's less than k0.

00:22:48.140 --> 00:23:02.940
So, I guess I don't have to write this positive part. Okay, now let's remember what k0 is supposed to be.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:12.780
k0 is supposed to be the smallest element of this set s. It's the smallest natural number so that when I multiply it by x, I get another natural number.

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:24.980
And from this k0, I constructed a new natural number called k1, which is less than k0, and it's a natural number.

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:54.400
But here comes the fun part. If we compute what x times k1 is, this is by definition x times k0 minus k0, this is equal to x squared, k0 minus x times k0.

00:23:54.400 --> 00:24:05.160
k0, which equals 2, k0 minus x times k0 because x squared equals 2.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:29.420
And this last part, this is equal to k0 plus k0 minus x k0, which equals k1.

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:43.980
Okay, now that's a natural number, that's a natural number, this natural number is bigger than this natural number. Therefore, their difference is again a natural number.

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:50.240
So this says that x times k1 is a natural number.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:25:20.220
Thus, k1 is in s, and k1 is less than k0, which implies k0 is not the least element in s.

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:32.120
Which is a contradiction to the fact that it is the least element of s.

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.480
Okay?

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:34.540
Okay?

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:58.800
So what we've shown is assuming that this set E has a supremum in rational numbers, then we arrive at a contradiction.

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:08.000
Okay, so our original assumption must be false, thus, soup E does not exist.

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:35.280
All right, so this proof is maybe a little different than if you've seen a proof of the fact that the square root of 2 is not a rational number.

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:46.640
So, remember, there's a different proof that maybe is a little bit simpler, but this one uses ordering instead to prove it, which I thought was pretty cool, and it's originally due to dedicine.

00:26:49.700 --> 00:27:12.660
Okay, so we've discussed one aspect of the real numbers that was in that theorem that I stated earlier, which I'll restate in a minute, namely that it is a set that has the least upper bound property.

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:22.160
Okay, so I stated that as a theorem, I'm not going to prove that theorem. We just want to understand exactly what sets the real numbers apart.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:31.160
And one aspect of that, there were two things. One is that it's an ordered field, and two is that it has the least upper bound property.

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:42.640
So we've now discussed what the least upper bound property means. So we just need to fill in one other part about the real numbers, which is the fact that it's an ordered field.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:28:03.980
So, and as I said before, Q is also an ordered field. R is not special in that respect, but as the theorem stated at the middle of the last lecture, that R is in fact the unique ordered field with the least upper bound property.

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:09.680
Remember, we've just proven that Q does not have the least upper bound property. So in some sense, Q is missing stuff.

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:24.220
Okay, it's missing stuff. It's missing square roots of two, which is kind of an algebraic thing, namely I can't solve the equation x squared minus two equals zero in the rational numbers.

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:39.040
And the fact that it's missing, that you have this kind of algebraic defect manifests itself in this fact that Q is also missing things with respect to an order.

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:49.860
Okay, so Q, in short, this is me saying that Q has holes, and R does not.

00:28:49.860 --> 00:29:16.220
I mean, that is probably the most basic statement one can make about R, but, and perhaps you heard in high school calculus, and you're hearing repeated now, but in a nutshell, I mean, Q has holes in R does not, but this means something very specifically that R has the least upper bound property and Q does not.

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:28.840
Okay, all right, so let me talk about what ordered fields are. So first off, I need to define what a field is.

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:36.560
So a set F is a field.

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:49.040
If it has two operations.

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:15.900
Plus, and I'm going to put a dot here in the middle times basically, such that you have a list of properties that hold with respect to these operations.

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:31.080
Okay, the first is with respect to, so this is plus, this is times, this is addition multiplication. Okay, so the first condition is that this set is closed with respect to taking sums.

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:49.580
So, if x, y is an F, then x plus y is an F. This operation of addition should be commutative.

00:30:54.340 --> 00:31:06.520
I hope that's how you spell it. This means that for all x, y, and F, x plus y equals y plus x.

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:31.520
So, this is the condition that for all x, y, z and F, if I add x and y, and then add z, this is equal to adding x to the sum of y and z.

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:46.820
So, the fourth is that we have, what's called an identity element, an additive identity element.

00:31:46.820 --> 00:32:02.760
There exists an element which I'll label zero in this set F, such that for all x and F, zero plus x equals zero.

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:32.740
And we also have additive inverses, namely for all x and F, there exists an element which I call, which I label minus x and F, such that x plus minus x is equal to zero.

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:42.840
So, these are the conditions on addition that should be satisfied for a field.

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:55.840
So, that's about addition. So, the conditions for multiplication are similar, namely needs to be closed with respect to multiplication.

00:32:55.840 --> 00:33:10.940
So, if x, y, is in F, then x times y is in F. Multiplication should also be commutative.

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:30.980
So, I'm just going to abbreviate that commutative as comm for all x, y, and F, x times y equals y times x. We also have associativity.

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:51.920
Well, let's not shorten it by that. For all x, y, z, and F, I multiply x times y, and then multiply it by z. It's the same as taking x and multiplying it by y times z.

00:33:55.300 --> 00:34:18.480
So, the fourth property is the existence of multiplicative identity. There exists an element which I label as one in this set F, such that for all x and F, one times x equals x.

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:46.160
And then I also have multiplicative inverses for non-zero elements. For all x and F, take away zero. So, for everything in the field that's non-zero, there exists an element which I call x to the minus one in F, such that x times x to the minus one equals one.

00:34:47.700 --> 00:35:12.760
Now, these are statements about the two operations. There's one last assumption in the definition that connects the two, and that's the distributive law, namely that for all x, y, z, and F, if I take x plus x.

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:41.520
So, y times z, this is x times z plus y times z. So, all these conditions, so a field is a set with two operations plus and dot, meaning multiplication, and these two operations need to satisfy all of these conditions for my set to be called a field.

00:35:43.300 --> 00:36:02.260
So, the clearest example is, of course, rational numbers with the usual plus and minus, let me plus and multiplication, define as you learned as a child.

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:28.800
Now, what's a non-example? The integers, so the integers come with plus and multiplication. However, it doesn't satisfy the existence of inverses of multiplicative inverses in F, but it does satisfy everything else.

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:50.300
And typically, one would call z, what's called a commutative commutative ring, commutative because multiplication is also commutative.

00:36:51.100 --> 00:37:04.140
But a ring in general does not necessarily have to satisfy multiplication being commutative, for example, the set of say two by two matrices, former ring.

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:28.740
What's an example of another example of a field? Well, we have, maybe I should have given this one first, z, two, which is the simplest field there is, is just the element of two, it's just a set of two elements, zero and one, where I need to define what one plus one is.

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:35.360
One plus one defined to be zero.

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:52.000
Okay? So, and one plus one is zero, and yeah, that's it. I mean, zero times zero would be zero, zero times one would be zero, zero plus zero would be zero.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:38:00.880
And that gives you all of the rules you need to know to be able to define multiplication and addition on this set of these two elements.

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:16.460
This is a field because what is the inverse of one? Well, it's just one. Okay? And you can check that if I define addition by this rule, along with the, you know, other rules that,

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:38.780
along with the, that these defining plus in multiplication this way satisfies all the conditions of being a field.

00:38:38.780 --> 00:39:00.400
Okay? More non-trivial example would be, let's say, z, three. This is a set zero, one, two. Only now, the arithmetic, so this, I didn't use such a fancy word here,

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:18.260
but arithmetic is done. Mod three here. Here it was mod two, meaning I, if I want to add two elements, I add them, and then I take the remainder of that sum after dividing by three.

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:32.440
So here, addition is defined mod three. So if something is a multiple of three, then I equate it to zero.

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:40.980
So for example, one plus two, which gives me three, it's a multiple of three. This is defined to be zero.

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:50.700
Okay? Two times two, which equals four, which equals three, plus one, multiples of three or zero, so that gives me one.

00:39:51.060 --> 00:40:00.620
In particular, this tells me that in this field, two times two equals one. So the multiplicative inverse of two is given by itself, two.

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:16.240
And a times b equals, let's say, d, mod three. Okay? So it's another example of a field.

00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:38.260
So there, in fact, if you take mod p, where p is a prime, you get another field. You get a finite field. So these are examples of what are called finite fields, because exactly that they are fields, and they have finite number of elements.

00:40:44.300 --> 00:41:06.100
Now, based on just these assumptions that you assume your field to satisfy, I mean, for it to be a field, you can prove kind of all of the simple algebra statements that you've ever known, simply from these axioms of fields.

00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:28.300
So for example, let me just give you kind of the silliest example of a statement you can prove just using these elements. I mean, these axioms, you can prove the statement that for all x and f, if f is, so f is a field here.

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:55.720
So f throughout will be, if x is a field, then for all x and f, zero times x is zero. Okay? All we know about zero is that when you add it to x, you get x back. Actually, this should have been, yeah, yeah, this should, this is wrong.

00:41:55.720 --> 00:42:19.920
This should have been x. Okay? Make sure there's no other errors. I don't think there are. This is another danger about not being able to lecture in person. It is that errors on the board persist.

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:47.500
Okay, so you can prove this blockbuster theorem just using these axioms. So let's do a proof of this if x is in f, then zero is equal to zero times x plus the additive inverse of zero times x, because that's just the definition of the additive inverse.

00:42:47.500 --> 00:43:13.380
Every element has an additive inverse. And now zero is equal to zero plus zero times x plus, again, the additive inverse of x. And now I use the distributive law. This is zero times x plus zero times x plus the additive inverse of zero times x.

00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:22.880
And that cancels with that, and I get zero times x. So I started off with zero, and I arrived at, it's equal to zero times x.

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:40.420
Alright? So, and you can prove other simple algebraic statements using these axioms as well. I think I'll put in the assignment.

00:43:49.940 --> 00:44:10.100
And I'll just state you can also prove things like, if I want to look at minus x, then this is equal to the additive inverse of one times x. Okay? I mean, this is like, you know, it's not terribly interesting at the start.

00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:28.620
There are, you know, essentially some very deep theorems in algebra that you learn at another point in your life, but that won't be in this class. Actually, today is probably all we're going to talk about fields, which are algebraic things.

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:52.260
You know, algebraic things are, to me, you know, nice, because somehow you always deal with equality. So how hard could it be to prove two things are equal to each other? Yet analysis deals a lot with inequality, which somehow is much more subtle.

00:44:53.120 --> 00:45:05.460
But that's just a little bias. Okay? So this is what a field is. A field is just, again, the set that has these two operations. What is an ordered field?

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:47.280
So it's a field first off. And which is also an ordered set. But it can't just, you know, you can't have two different structures on your field and them not interact for that to be interesting.

00:45:49.400 --> 00:46:08.420
So such that the algebraic structure and the order on the field are cohabitating nicely, meaning you have two conditions for all x, y, z, and f.

00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:37.600
If x is less than y, then x plus z is less than y plus z. And one other condition, x is positive, or if x is bigger than zero, and y is bigger than zero, then x times y is bigger than zero.

00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:56.180
Okay? And I just use that terminology anyways right now, but for an ordered field f, if an element is bigger than zero, then we call it positive.

00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:20.320
Or if it's bigger than or equal to zero, we say x is positive, and respectively non-negative. So non-negative, if x is bigger than or equal to zero, positive, if x is bigger than zero.

00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:40.840
And then likewise with negative and non-positive. Okay? And so the most basic example, again, is q. q is an ordered field. All right, with the usual order and with the usual algebraic structure on q.

00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:57.240
Okay? What is not an example is either one of the two fields I wrote down just a minute ago.

00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:30.000
So, a non-example is this field here, zero one.

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:52.200
So, you know, if I put an order on this, either zero is less than one or one is less than zero. So remember, order does not have to, you know, necessarily correspond to the fact that that zero, you connect to zero in the integers, and that one you connect to one in the integers.

00:48:52.640 --> 00:49:00.900
I mean, these are just two elements of a set, and an order would be saying either that element is less than that element or that element is less than that element.

00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:13.300
So, let's consider either cases, and suppose we have that order on this set and show that it's not, it does not turn this set into an ordered field.

00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:35.660
So, then either zero is less than one or one is less than zero.

00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:50.660
So, let's do the first case. Zero is less than one.

00:49:50.660 --> 00:50:01.040
If zero is less than one, then what happens if I add one to each side?

00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:21.780
So, one plus zero would give me one. One plus one would be zero, and therefore is not, so less than one plus one.

00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:25.220
So, it does not satisfy the first property.

00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:47.000
So, if I have an order on z2, two possibilities, either zero is less than one or one is less than zero.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:58.520
If zero is less than one, then by the definition of addition on this set, I would, if I add one to zero, I get one. If I add one to one, I get zero.

00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:06.060
And therefore, if I were to add one to both sides, I would not get a true inequality because I'm assuming zero is less than one.

00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:15.940
So, this condition number one does not hold for this order, and neither does it hold for choosing one is less than zero.

00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:37.060
So, by the same logic, then one, so one plus one is not less than one.

00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:47.280
So, this set is not, this field cannot be turned into an ordered field.

00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:58.480
And essentially, the same thing that I've done here shows that you cannot have any finite ordered field.

00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:20.120
So, in general, there are no finite ordered fields.

00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:40.560
Now, just like we proved, the blockbuster statement at zero times anything in the field equals zero,

00:52:40.560 --> 00:53:04.360
we can also prove all of the manipulations of inequalities that you use without fear, simply from, again, these axioms about an ordered field being a field and also satisfying these two inequalities.

00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:11.080
These two conditions here for it to be an ordered field.

00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:34.580
So, for example,

00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:52.520
if f is an ordered field, then if x is an element of f and x is positive, this implies its additive inverse is negative, and vice versa.

00:53:53.260 --> 00:54:00.220
If x is less than zero, then minus x is positive.

00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:11.680
So, I know it's tempting to think, well, yeah, just multiply this inequality by minus one to give this inequality.

00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:16.900
But remember, this is really a statement about the additive inverse of x.

00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:30.680
So, the proof is not hard.

00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:45.340
If x is positive, then, well, I can write it this way, write it zero is less than x.

00:54:47.380 --> 00:55:03.180
Then, by property number one, I can add anything to both sides and get the same inequality and preserve the inequality. Therefore, minus x plus zero is less than the additive inverse of x plus x.

00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:21.640
Now, by the fact that zero is the additive identity, a four, the left side is going to be minus x, and by the definition of the additive inverse of x, the right-hand side is going to be zero.

00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:45.840
And that's it. So, what's going in here is this is by a four and a five, and this previous statement is by one in this definition before.

00:55:45.840 --> 00:56:02.960
And I'm not going to prove this statement as well. It's essentially the same proof. I add minus x to both sides and use which I can do by one, and then I use a four and a five to conclude that x is minus x is positive.

00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:06.940
Okay.

00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:06.940


00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:41.700
So, let me just say, see proposition, 1.1.8 in textbook for

00:56:44.940 --> 00:57:05.720
the other proofs of standard inequality manipulations.

00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:30.920
Okay. So, q is an ordered field, and as I stated before, about r, r is also an ordered field, but it has a least upper bound property.

00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:43.160
So, maybe you are asking yourself, how about some sort of greatest lower bound property? The least upper bound property is about soups.

00:57:43.160 --> 00:58:09.300
Can we make a similar property about imps? Are there sets that have the least upper bound property that don't have, say, a greatest lower bound property, meaning, does there exist something has the greatest lower bound property if every non-empty set which is bounded below has an infimum.

00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:26.420
That's kind of what I'm referring to, even though I haven't written it down. So, okay, what is that leading up to? In the setting of ordered fields, there really is no difference between a least upper bound property and a greatest lower bound property.

00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:36.980
If I have an ordered field which satisfies a least upper bound property, then it also satisfies a greatest lower bound property.

00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:58.040
So, which I'll state as a theorem, and then we'll prove that fb in ordered field

00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:26.920
with the least upper bound property. Now, I'm going to prove that it has, if you like, a greatest lower bound property, then if a is a subset of f, which is non-empty,

00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:50.920
and bounded below, then, impa exists in f, meaning a has an infimum in the set f.

00:59:56.680 --> 01:00:18.280
Okay, so the proof of this is basically, in some sense, we kind of did something similar when we proved that one set given by all the minus one minus two minus three had the greatest upper bound property, or the least upper bound property, by taking its minus,

01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:30.620
and then using, in a sense, the greatest lower bound property of the natural numbers, this well ordering principle, to conclude that that set had the least upper bound property.

01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:47.200
And that's what we're going to do here, is we're going to take a set which is bounded below, take its minus, if you like, which is now bounded above, take the soup of that set which we can do, and show that that's the infimum of.

01:00:48.500 --> 01:01:15.820
That set. So, let me write over here, this should be, you know, not part of the proof, but kind of some intuition, and I'll draw it like f is the real number line, which it is, because part of the statement about the real numbers is that it's the unique ordered field with the least upper bound property,

01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:36.140
but don't worry about that for now. Let's imagine we have set a, and for now I'll draw it like it's an interval, which is bounded below.

01:01:36.700 --> 01:02:02.300
So, it stops after some point, and there's nothing there, so it's bounded below. Then, if I look at minus a, so here I'm drawing zero, if I look at minus a, which is the set of elements, the set of the additive inverses of a, I now have a set which is bounded above.

01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:23.120
So, if this is a lower bound for a, then minus b will be an upper bound for minus a, and therefore minus a has a least upper bound, which in this picture I'm drawing looks like x, and so then my goal is then to show that,

01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:44.360
so here let's go back to b, here's a, and here's now minus x, to show that minus x is an infimum of a, so that's the basic intuition on why this holds.

01:02:44.360 --> 01:03:11.020
We're using the ordered field property to be able to take minuses, okay? That's where the field property is coming in, and that minuses, although we didn't prove this, it is one of those, essentially we did prove this that if I have something positive and I multiply it through by minus one, using this as well, then that reverses the inequality.

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:36.660
But again, these are short, unless I'm telling you to prove a certain inequality, simple inequality statement like of this type, feel freely used kind of the inequality facts that you remember from high school.

01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:46.260
Okay? And just know that these persist for ordered fields in general. Okay.

01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:55.780
So let's turn this intuition into a proof.

01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:09.980
Suppose a, so I'm not stating it here, but f is an ordered field with the least upper bound property. I'll go ahead and state it.

01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:25.120
Suppose f is an ordered field with the least upper bound property.

01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:43.780
Let a be subset of f, a not equal to empty set, a bounded below.

01:04:48.920 --> 01:05:10.780
Then that means there exists an element b in f such that b is less than or equal to a, such that for all a in capital A, b is less than or equal to a.

01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:19.780
Okay?

01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:35.480
And you just need to turn it into English because we're in Massachusetts. If you're a different country, you turn into the language that's spoken there.

01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:42.620
You just need to turn it into written word. So there exists a lower bound for a.

01:05:48.960 --> 01:06:05.040
Let me just note another set called minus, which I'll label minus a. This is the set of all elements in f of the form minus the additive inverses of a as a is in capital A.

01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:09.920
So it's the additive inverses of all elements in capital A.

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:32.720
Then the fact that I have for all a and a, b is less than or equal to a implies for all a and a minus a is less than or equal to minus b.

01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:39.160
Because multiplying through by minus one flips the inequality.

01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:48.720
Okay? That implies so minus b is bigger than or equal to every element of minus a.

01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:59.060
So that implies b is upper bound for the set minus a.

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:12.060
So minus a is a non-empty subset of f, which is bounded above. Therefore, it has a supremum.

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:24.680
Thus, there exists an x and f such that x equals soup of this set minus a.

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:35.520
This is because we're assuming the least upper bound property that every non-empty set which is bounded above has a supremum.

01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:45.740
Okay? I'm going to show this guy x is in fact the infimum of this set a or minus x is the infimum of a.

01:07:56.260 --> 01:08:09.580
So the fact that x is the supremum of minus a implies that for all a and capital A minus a is less than or equal to x because x is supposed to be the least upper bound.

01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:26.260
So it's in fact an upper bound. So that means that for all a and a again just flipping the inequalities minus x is less than or equal to a, which implies minus x is a lower bound for capital A.

01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:45.840
We now have to show that minus x is the greatest lower bound of a. If I take any other lower bound of a, then minus x is bigger than or equal to that lower bound.

01:08:52.020 --> 01:09:12.480
Now show that if let's call it something else y is lower bound for a, then y is less than or equal to minus x.

01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:25.380
And then that concludes the proof showing that minus x is in fact the infimum of a. And therefore a has an infimum. We've actually identified what the infimum is. It's the soup of minus a.

01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:46.360
Okay. So let y be a lower bound for a. Then exactly how I showed this for this single lower bound that I had for a.

01:09:46.360 --> 01:10:13.640
You can verify this again just go through the argument and replace b with y. Then minus y is an upper bound. Just look at the picture, you know, replace b with y for minus a, which implies since x is a supremum of a.

01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:29.520
So since x is a supremum of minus a, it's the least upper bound. So it has to be less than or equal to minus y.

01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:39.980
And flipping the inequality again on that means that y is less than or equal to minus x.

01:10:44.380 --> 01:11:01.760
Okay. And which is what we wanted to prove. Thus the inf of a exists. And we've in fact showed that it's equal to the soup of minus a.

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:18.780
Okay. So in an ordered field. Not with the least upper bound property. Not only does every set which is bounded above have a supremum. Every set which is bounded below has an infimum.

01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:38.780
Okay. So now we move on and not talk about generalities, but we're just going to focus on R, the set of real numbers. And I'm just going to again state this theorem about the existence of R and its properties.

01:11:38.780 --> 01:12:00.020
So just to bring this all back to our goal of describing exactly what R is or what separates it from q is that.

01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:27.100
So there exists a unique ordered field with the least upper bound property containing q.

01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:30.600
Okay. And this field.

01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:56.280
So we denote by R. Okay. So q does just to bring this back. So we started off in ancient times with, you know, the natural numbers.

01:12:56.740 --> 01:13:14.400
We moved to the integers so that we can take additive inverses, although they didn't call them that. But we wanted zero. And then we moved to the rational numbers because we didn't have ways to solve the equation 2x plus 1 equals 0.

01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:37.780
And so we moved on from q to R, essentially because we can't solve the equation x squared minus 2 equals 0. And this inability to solve x squared minus 2 equals 0, although an algebraic fact, you know, in fact,

01:13:40.800 --> 01:14:01.300
it means that q is incomplete as an ordered set. Okay. It does not have this least upper bound property. And, you know, what characterizes the real numbers is that it is an ordered field containing q. And it's the unique one with the least upper bound property.

01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:28.560
This unique should be kind of in quotes because unique up to what's called isomorphism. Isomorphism is a fancy way of, you know, saying what you call apples, I call manzanas.

01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:51.900
Essentially. Okay. So this is what R is. It's the unique ordered field with the least upper bound property containing q. And from, so I'm not going to prove this theorem. The way you usually prove this theorem, you construct R, either as what are called dedicine cuts.

01:14:53.980 --> 01:15:18.860
Or as equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences, we'll talk about Cauchy sequences soon, ish. But I'm more interested in, you know, proving properties about R and then going on to functions on R limits, which is what analysis is, is a study of limits.

01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:39.000
Rather than get tied up in really non analytic facts, you know, algebraic facts, trying to construct this, this R, the actual field. So we're just going to take this as a given. And now we're going to go from here and start proving facts about real numbers.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:16:05.300
Okay. You know, where q failed R succeeds. So, first fact is that there exists a unique element in R such that R is positive.

01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:21.280
And R squared equals two. So we saw before that if I replace this with q, rational number, that's false. Okay. There does not exist a rational number who squares two. But in the real numbers, there does.

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:40.460
And right now, maybe you're tempted to just say, yeah, you said R equal to square root of two. Well, what is square root of two? You know, I mean, how do you come up with that guy? So we have to come up with some element of R who squares two.

01:16:40.460 --> 01:17:04.580
Now, we basically did that a minute ago in the rational numbers and kind of the same proof works here. So, let E be the set of all x's in R such that x is positive and x squared is less than two.

01:17:04.580 --> 01:17:29.240
So, earlier in the lecture and at the end of the last lecture, we had q here. Right? Well, the same proof basically, and what we did earlier than E is bounded above by two.

01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:51.480
So, R, which I, so, soup E tilde exists in R. So, I have this set. It's bounded above by two. I mean, we did the proof earlier.

01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:58.520
So, by the least upper bound property of R, the supremum exists. Okay? Call this element little R.

01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:22.520
Then the same proof, I'm not going to do it again because we've already done it. And all you need to do is replace R q's with R's.

01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:46.920
Show R is bigger than or equal to one. In fact, it's bigger than one. And R squared equals two. Okay? So, there does exist an element of R, which is positive and who squares two.

01:18:46.920 --> 01:19:15.540
Now, I will prove that it's unique. So, now I want to prove that R is unique. That means, if I take, if there's some other element in capital R that satisfies these two inequalities, then it must be equal to my original R.

01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:45.220
So, suppose R tilde is in R. R tilde is bigger than zero. And R tilde squared equals two. Okay? Then, since their square is the same number, namely two, zero is equal to R tilde minus R.

01:19:45.220 --> 01:20:09.260
R squared, which equals R tilde plus R. R tilde minus R. Now, both R and R tilde are positive. So, R plus R tilde is positive, in particular, it's non-zero. So, since it's a field, I can therefore divide or multiply both sides by the additive inverse of this thing.

01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:24.520
And, arrive at zero is equal to R tilde minus R, or R equals R tilde. So, there exists only one element in the real numbers, which is positive and who squares two.

01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:48.520
And, I'll put it on the assignment. Namely that. So, this shows what? Square root of two exists. Okay? But you can then show.

01:20:52.160 --> 01:21:15.680
And, cube root of two exists in R. And, we'll not prove this, but you can show in general that if X is in R, then X is the one over N.

01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:44.540
And, I should say X is positive for all natural numbers. Okay? So, where Q failed are succeeds. And, it's doing this, or the fact that it does succeed is not coming from an algebraic property of R.

01:21:44.540 --> 01:21:53.740
It's coming from this property about its order. Okay? All right. We'll stop there.
