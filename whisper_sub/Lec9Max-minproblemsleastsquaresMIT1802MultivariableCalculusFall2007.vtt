00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.800
Today we're going to see how to use what we saw last time

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.080
about virtual derivatives.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.740
To kind of minimization or maximization

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.420
problems involving functions of several variables.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.240
So if all that's, so remember last time we say it,

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.640
but when we have a function of two variables x and y,

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.960
then we have actually two different derivatives.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.980
Partial f, partial x, also called f sub x,

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.400
is the derivative with respect to x keeping y constant.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.320
And we have partial f, partial y, also called f sub y,

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.580
where we vary y and we pay x as a constant.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.880
OK?

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.600
And now, one thing I didn't have time to tell you about,

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:29.980
but hopefully you have a little bit of a problem.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.100
So what I'm talking about in recitation yesterday

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.660
is the approximation formula.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.140
That tells you what happens if you vary both x and y.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.020
So f sub x tells us what happens if we change x a little bit

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.480
by some small amount delta x.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.560
f sub y tells us how f changes if we change y

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.780
by a small amount delta y.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.760
If we do both at the same time, then the two effects

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.020
will add up with each other.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.540
Because you can imagine that first two will change x,

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.680
and then you will change y of the other way around.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.580
It doesn't really matter.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:17.860
So if we change x by a certain amount delta x,

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.640
and if we change y by the amount delta y,

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.520
and let's say that we have z equals f of x y,

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:36.080
then that changes by an amount which is approximately f sub x

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.400
times delta x plus f sub y times delta y.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.680
And that's one of the most important formulas

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.740
about partial derivatives.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.620
So the intuition for this again is just the two effects

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.380
add up.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.200
If I change x by a small amount, and then I change y,

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.200
while first changing x will modify f.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.460
How much does it modify f?

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.960
The answer is the rate of change is f sub x.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.820
And if I change y, then the rate of change of f,

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.440
when I change y is f sub y.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.400
So all together, I get this change in the value of f.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.020
And of course, that's only an approximation formula.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.820
Actually, there would be higher order terms involving seconds

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.500
and third derivatives and so on.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.700
So one way to justify this.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.700
Sorry, I was distracted by microphone problem.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:53.860
OK, so how do we justify this formula?

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.080
Well, one way to think about it is in terms of tangent

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.200
plane approximation.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.520
So let's think about the tangent plane

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.440
to the graph of a function f.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.740
So we have some pictures to show you.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.040
It will be easier if I show the pictures.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.880
OK, so remember, partial f, partial x,

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.800
was obtained by looking at the situation

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.980
where y is held constant.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.100
So that means I'm slicing the graph of f by a plane

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.100
that's parallel to the x z plane.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.740
And then when I change x, z changes.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.980
And the slope of that is going to be the derivative

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:42.780
respect to x.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.940
So now if I do the same in the other direction,

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.700
then I will have similarly the slope in a slice

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.460
now parallel to the y z plane that will be partial f,

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.040
partial y.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.860
So in fact, in each case, I have a line and that line

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.180
is tangent to the surface.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.740
So now if I have two lines tangent to the surface,

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.920
well, then together, they determine for me

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.800
the tangent plane to the surface.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.700
OK, so let's try to see how that works.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:25.340
So we know that f sub x and f sub y are slopes

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:33.020
of two tangent lines to this plane.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.240
Sorry, two tangent lines to the graph.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.100
And let's write down the equations of these lines.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.820
I'm not going to write parametric equations.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.920
I'm going to write them in terms of x, y, z coordinates.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:51.180
So let's say that partial f of our partial x at a given point

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.140
is equal to a, then that means that we have a line

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.400
given by the following conditions.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.100
So I'm going to keep y constant equal to y zero.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.340
And I'm going to change x.

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:12.880
And as I change x, z will change at a rate that's equal to a.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:18.800
So that would be z equals z zero plus a times the change

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.400
in x, x minus x zero.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:27.380
OK, that is how you would describe the line that,

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.080
I guess, the one that's plotted in green here,

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.420
that's the intersection with a slice parallel to the x

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:32.800
z plane.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.340
I hold y constant equal to y zero.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:41.040
And z is a function of x that varies with a rate of a.

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.840
And now if I look similarly at the other slice,

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.700
let's say that the partial with respect to y is equal to b,

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.920
then I get another line, which is obtained by the fact

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:07.440
that z now will depend on y and the rate of change

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:13.340
with respect to y will be b, while x is held constant equal

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:14.280
to x zero.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.880
So these two lines are both going to be in the tangent plane

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:19.800
to the surface.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.340
So they're both tangent to the half of f.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.520
And well, together, they determine the plane.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:00.980
And that plane is just given by the formula z equals z zero

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:08.400
plus a times x minus x zero plus b times y minus y zero.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.780
If you look at what happens, so this

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:19.680
is the equation of a plane, z equals constant times x

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.260
plus constant times y plus constant.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.800
And if you look at what happens if I hold y constant and very

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:30.380
x, I recover the first line, if I hold x constant and very

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:31.660
y, I get the second line.

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:35.740
Another way to do it, of course, would be to write actually

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:39.660
parametric equations of these lines get vectors along them

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:41.980
and then take the cross product to get the normal vector

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.860
to the plane and then get this equation of a plane

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.900
using the normal vector.

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.560
That also works and it gives you the same formula.

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:56.160
So if you're curious, exercise, do it again using parametrics

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.340
and using cross product to get the plane equation.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.460
Okay, so that's how we get the tangent plane.

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:06.740
And now what this approximation formula here says is that,

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.700
in fact, the graph of the function is close to the tangent plane.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:12.900
If we were moving on the tangent plane,

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.940
this would be an actual equality.

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:19.120
Delta z would be a linear function of delta x and delta y.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:23.080
And the graph of the function is near the tangent plane,

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:24.580
but it's not quite the same.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:28.420
So it's only an approximation for small delta x and small delta y.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:41.460
So the approximation formula says the graph of f

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.900
is close to its tangent plane.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:10:00.980
Okay, and we can use that formula over here now to estimate

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:05.720
how the value of f changes if I change x and y at the same time.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.840
Okay, questions about that?

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:18.600
Okay, so now that we've caught up with what we were supposed

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:26.040
to see on Tuesday, I can tell you now about maximum main problems.

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:40.840
So that's going to be an application of partial derivatives.

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:51.180
To look at optimization problems.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.600
Okay, so maybe, you know, then you ask from now,

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.220
when you have a real job, your job might be to actually minimize

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.760
the cost of something or maximize the profit of something.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.280
But typically, the function that you will have to,

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:17.020
you know, strive to minimize or maximize will depend on several variables.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:23.100
So if you have a function of one variable, you know that to find

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.920
its minimum or its maximum, you look at the derivative and you set that equal to zero.

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:30.400
And you try to then look at what happens to the function.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.800
So here's going to be kind of similar.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.280
Except, of course, we have several derivatives.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:52.060
Okay, so for today, we'll think about a function of two variables.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:56.160
But it works exactly the same if you have three variables, ten variables,

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:56.940
a million variables.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:11.980
So the first observation is that, so if we have a local minimum or a local maximum,

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:22.440
then both partial derivative, so partial f partial x and partial f partial y

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.820
are both zero at the same time.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.600
So why is that?

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:32.420
Well, let's say that f sub x is zero, that means when I vary x,

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:37.080
well, to first order of the function doesn't change, maybe that's because it's going through.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:44.600
If I look only at the slice parallel to the x axis, then maybe I'm going through the minimum.

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:50.280
But then if partial f partial y is not zero, then actually by changing y,

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.240
I could still make a value larger or smaller.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.860
So that wouldn't be an actual maximum or minimum.

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:59.120
It would only be a maximum or minimum if I stay in the slice.

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.600
But if I allow myself to change y, that doesn't work.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:07.020
So I need actually to know that if I change y, the value will not change either to first order.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.940
So that's why I also need partial f partial y to be zero.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.780
Now, let's say that we are both zero.

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:14.620
Well, why is that enough?

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:20.920
It's essentially enough because of this formula telling me that if both of these guys are zero,

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.640
then to first order of the function doesn't change.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:28.300
And then of course there will be maybe quadratic terms that will actually turn that, you know,

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.280
this won't really say that your function is actually constant.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:39.780
It will just tell you that maybe it will be actually quadratic or higher order in delta x and delta y.

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.560
That's what you expect to have at the maximum or minimum.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:44.140
Okay?

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:56.460
So we have, okay, so that condition is the same thing as saying that the tangent plane

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:08.160
to the graph is actually going to be horizontal.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:13.340


00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.700
And that's what you want to have.

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:19.680
So you have a minimum.

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:27.480
Well, see that the tangent plane at this point, at the bottom of the graph is going to be horizontal.

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:37.620
And you can see that on this equation of the tangent plane, when both these coefficients are zero,

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:41.920
that's when the equation becomes z equals constant, the horizontal plane.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:44.420
Okay, does that make sense?

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:56.100
Okay, so we'll have a name for this kind of point, because actually what we'll see very soon is that these conditions are necessary,

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.060
but they're not sufficient.

00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:01.260
There's actually other kinds of points where the partial derivatives are zero.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.580
So let's give a name to this.

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:19.740
We say, the definition, we say that x, let's say x zero y zero is a critical point of f.

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:40.960
If the partial derivative with respect to x and the partial derivative with respect to y are both zero.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:48.760
Okay, more generally, you would want all the partial derivatives, no matter how many variables you have,

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:51.220
you want all the partial to be zero at the same time.

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:59.360
Okay, so let's see an example.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:21.080
So let's say I give you the function f of x, y equals x squared minus 2x, y plus a, y squared plus 2x.

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:30.720
Okay, let's try to figure out whether we can minimize or maximize this.

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:37.560
So what we'll start doing immediately is taking the partial derivatives.

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:40.000
Okay, so what is f sub x?

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:51.780
Let's dance with 2x minus 2y plus 0 plus 2.

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:57.400
Remember that y is a constant, so this differentiates to 0.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:10.520
Now if we do f sub y, that's going to be, well, 0 minus 2x plus 6y minus 2.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.660
And what we want to do is set these things equal to 0.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.820
And we want to solve these two equations at the same time.

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:24.060
Okay, so an important thing to remember, I mean, maybe I should have told you a couple of weeks ago already,

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:30.000
if you have two equations to solve, well, it's very good to try to simplify them by adding them together or whatever.

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.360
But you must keep two equations, okay?

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:35.820
If you have two equations, you should not end up with just one equation out of nowhere.

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:42.880
Okay, so for example here, we can certainly simplify things by summing them together.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:51.680
See, if we add them together, well, the x is cancel and the constants cancel.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:55.120
And in fact, we just left with 4y for 0.

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:59.260
That's pretty good, but tells us y should be 0.

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:03.640
But then we should, of course, go back to these and see what else we know.

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:08.900
Well, now it tells us, so if you put y equals 0, it tells you 2x plus 2 equals 0.

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:15.660
That tells you x equals minus 1.

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.740
Okay, so we have one critical point.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:26.920
That's xy equals minus 1 and 0.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:34.320
Okay? Any questions, so far?

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.220
No? Well, you should have a question.

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:43.080
Question should be, how do we know if it's a maximum or a minimum?

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:56.500
Well, yeah, so if we had a function of one variable, we would decide things based on the second derivative.

00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:01.260
And in fact, we'll see tomorrow how to do things based on the second derivative.

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:05.480
But that's kind of tricky because there's a lot of second derivatives.

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:08.260
I mean, we already have two first derivatives.

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:14.640
You can imagine that if you keep taking partials, you may end up with, you know, more and more.

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.840
So we'll have to figure out carefully what the condition should be.

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:20.160
So we'll do that tomorrow.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:29.620
So now let's just try to look a bit at, you know, how do we understand these things by hand?

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:43.680
So, in fact, let me point out to you immediately that there's more than maximum and minimum.

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:51.140
So remember, we saw, you know, the example of x squared plus y squared that has a critical point,

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.040
that critical point is obviously a minimum.

00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:00.560
And of course, it could be a local minimum because it could be that, you know, if you have a more complicated function,

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:05.640
there's indeed a minimum here, but then elsewhere, the function drops to a lower value.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:13.540
So we call that just, we call that just a local minimum to say that it's a minimum if you stick to values that are close enough.

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:20.060
Of course, you also have a local maximum where I didn't plot it, but it's easy to plot, okay?

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.180
That's a local maximum.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:29.740
But there's a third example of critical point and that's a saddle point, okay?

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:35.900
So the saddle point, it's a new phenomenon that you don't really see in a single variable calculus.

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:43.160
It's a critical point that's a minimum or a maximum because depending on which direction you look in,

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:45.020
it's either one or the other.

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:51.080
So here, see the point in the middle at the origin is a saddle point.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:59.860
Just, you know, if you look at the tangent plane to this graph, you'll see that it's actually horizontal at the origin.

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:07.120
You have this mountain pass, you know, at the mountain pass, the ground is horizontal, but depending on which direction you go,

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:08.280
you go up or down.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:16.040
So we say that the point is a saddle point if it's a minimum or a maximum.

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:35.240
Okay, so possibilities could be a local max or a saddle.

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:44.140
Okay, so tomorrow we'll see how to decide which one it is in general using second derivatives.

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:48.140
For this time, let's just try to do it, you know, by hand.

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.460
So I just want to observe.

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:58.200
In fact, I can try to, you know, these examples that I have here,

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:02.560
they're x squared plus y squared, y squared minus x squared, they're sums or differences of squares.

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:07.620
And if we know that we can put fingers as sum of squares, for example, will be done.

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:11.760
So let's try to express this, maybe as the square of something.

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:18.180
Well, so the problem, the main problem is this 2xy.

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:24.720
But, observe, we know something that starts with x squared minus 2xy, that is actually the square of something else.

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:31.280
Right? It would be x squared minus 2xy, well, plus y squared, not plus free y squared.

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.300
So let's try to do that.

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.280
So we're going to complete the square.

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:50.940
So I'm going to say it's x minus y squared.

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:55.600
And then, so that gives me the first two terms and also y squared.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:58.240
Well, I still need to add two more y squares.

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:05.360
And I also need to add, of course, the 2x minus 2y.

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:15.340
It's simpler. It's still not simple enough for my taste.

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:18.020
I can actually do better. See?

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:23.000
I mean, now what's, so this guy's looked like a sum of squares, but here I have this extra stuff.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.980
But, oh, 2x minus 2y, well, that's twice x minus y.

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:31.420
It looks like maybe we can modify this and make this into another square.

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:41.300
Okay? So in fact, I can simplify this further to x minus y plus 1 squared.

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:44.680
See? That would start like, like, the parameters here.

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:49.980
That would be x minus y squared plus twice x minus y.

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:54.380
Okay? And then there's a plus 1. Well, we don't have that plus 1, so let's remove it by subtracting one.

00:23:56.100 --> 00:24:00.360
Okay? Oh. So let me find that minus 1 here.

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:02.360
And I still have my 2y squared.

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:06.180
Okay? Do you see why this is the same function as that one?

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:07.780
Yeah?

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:16.560
So again, you know, if I expand x minus y plus 1 squared,

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:22.920
I get x minus y squared plus twice x minus y, that's what's guys, plus 1.

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:25.720
But I will have a minus 1 that we cancel out.

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:27.580
And then I have a plus 2y squared.

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:39.780
Okay? So now what I know, see, this is a sum of 2 squares minus 1.

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:48.320
And this critical point, xy equals minus 1, 0, that's exactly when this is 0 and that is 0.

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:49.700
So that's the smallest value.

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:57.880
This is always greater or equal to 0, same with that one.

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:03.780
So that's always at least minus 1 and minus 1 happens to be the value at the critical point.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.340
So it's a minimum.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.400
Okay? Now of course here I was very lucky.

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:19.580
I mean generally I couldn't expect things to simplify that much.

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:21.860
In fact I cheated. I started from that.

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:24.180
I expanded and then that's how I got my example.

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:30.920
Okay? So the general method will be a bit different,

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:37.260
but you will see it will actually also involve completing squares just vers more to it than what we've seen.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:43.140
Okay, so we'll come back to this tomorrow.

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:52.080
Sorry? How do I know that this equals?

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.140
Why is what negative 1?

00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:57.500
Sorry.

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:12.740
How do I know that that whole function is greater or equal to negative 1?

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:19.540
Well I wrote f of xy as something squared plus 2y squared minus 1.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.020
Okay? This squared is always a positive number, not negative.

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:29.020
Right? It's a square. The square of something is always non-negative.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:33.180
Similarly, y squared is also always non-negative.

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:38.820
So if you add something that's at least 0 plus something that's at least 0 and you subtract 1,

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.420
you get always at least minus 1.

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:47.280
And in fact the only way that you can get minus 1 is if both of these guys are 0 at the same time.

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:55.640
Okay? So that's how I get my minimum.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:03.780
So more about this tomorrow.

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:25.340
So in fact, what I would like to tell you about now instead is a nice application of minmax problems

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:31.580
that maybe you don't think of as a minmax problem, but you will see because I mean you don't think that way

00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:36.360
because probably your calculator can do it for you or if not your computer can do it for you.

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:43.880
But it's actually something where the theory is based on minimization in two variables.

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:51.460
So very often in experimental sciences you have to do something called list squares interpolation.

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:54.180
And what is that about?

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:08.640
Well, it's the idea that maybe you do some experiments and you know you record some data.

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:11.300
So you have some data x and some other data y.

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:23.880
And I don't know maybe for example x is maybe you're measuring frogs and you're trying to measure how big the frog leg is compared to the eyes of a frog or whatever.

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:25.600
You know trying to measure something.

00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:36.820
And you know if you're doing chemistry then it could be you know how much you put of some reactants and the output how much of the output product that you wanted to synthesize is generated.

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:39.220
All sorts of things.

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:41.860
Make up your own example.

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:47.640
But so you know you measure basically for various values of x what the value of y ends up being.

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:52.420
And then you know you would like to claim oh well these points are kind of aligned.

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:58.860
And of course to an mathematician they are not aligned but to an experimental scientist that's evidence that there's a relation between the two.

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:04.880
And so you want to claim and you know in your paper you will actually throw a nice little line like that.

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:08.040
See these two functions depend linearly on each other.

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:09.240
Okay.

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:14.980
So the question is how do we come up with that nice line that passes smack in the middle of the points.

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:23.280
So the question is given experimental data.

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.540
X i y i.

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:34.700
So maybe I should actually be more precise.

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:37.460
So you're given some experimental data.

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:44.520
You have you know data point x one y one x two y two and so on x and y n.

00:29:46.600 --> 00:30:02.120
The question would be find the best fit line of the form y equals a x plus b that somehow.

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:05.180
So you know approximate experiment with this data.

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:10.980
So you know you can also use that by the way to predict various things.

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:19.180
For example if you look at your new homework actually the first problem asks you to predict how many iPods will be on this planet in 10 years.

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:20.800
Okay.

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:25.800
Looking at you know past sales and how they behave.

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:31.640
One thing by the way before you you know lose all the money you don't have yet.

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:34.080
You cannot use that to predict the stock market.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:34.520
Okay.

00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:40.380
So don't try to use that to make money it doesn't work.

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:46.120
So.

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:58.000
One tricky thing here that I want to draw your attention to is what are the unknowns here.

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:04.680
So the natural answer would be to say well the unknowns are x and y that's not actually the case.

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:07.940
Okay. We are not trying to solve for some x and y.

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:15.400
I mean we have some values given to us and when we are looking for when we are looking for that line we don't really care about the particular value of x.

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:19.820
What we care about is actually this coefficients a and b.

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:25.360
That will tell us what the relation is between x and y.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.940
So in fact we are trying to solve for a and b that will give us the nicest possible line for this point.

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:39.460
Okay. So the unknowns in our equations will have to be a and b not x and y.

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:11.400
Okay.

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:20.200
So the question really is find the best a and b.

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:24.860
And of course we have to decide what we mean by best.

00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:37.560
So best will mean that we minimize some function of a and b that measures the total error that we are making when we are choosing this line compared to the experimental data.

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:42.940
So maybe roughly speaking it should measure how far these points are from the line.

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:51.840
But now there are various ways to do it and some of them are, I mean they are all actually, you know, a lot of them are valid.

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:56.780
If they give you different answers you have to decide what it is that you prefer.

00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:04.520
So for example you could measure the distance to the line, you know, by projecting perpendicularly.

00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:16.280
Or you could measure instead the difference between for a given value of x, the difference between the experimental value of y and the predicted one.

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:22.400
And that's often more relevant because you know these guys are actually maybe expressing different units.

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:24.680
They are not the same type of quantity.

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:28.380
So you can't actually combine them arbitrarily.

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:33.600
But anyway, so the convention is usually we measure distance in this way.

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:42.040
Next you could try to minimize the largest distance, you know, say we look at where's the largest error and we make that the smallest possible.

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:50.600
The drawback of doing that is experimentally very often you have one data point that's not good because maybe you know you fell asleep in front of the experiment.

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:52.840
And so you didn't measure the right thing.

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:59.340
So you tend to want to, you know, not give too much importance to some data point that's far away from the others.

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:02.600
So maybe instead you want to measure, you know, the average distance.

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:09.120
Or maybe you want to actually give more weight to things that are far away.

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:12.200
And then you don't want to do the distance but the square of the distance.

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:14.120
So there's various possible answers.

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:19.120
But one of them gives us actually a particularly nice formula for A and B.

00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:21.340
And so that's why it's the universally used one.

00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:25.400
Okay. And so here it says list squares.

00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:31.320
So that's because we'll measure actually the sum of the squares of the errors.

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:34.600
And why do we do that?

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:37.220
Well, part of it is because actually it looks good.

00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:45.320
I mean, you know, when you see these plots in scientific papers, they really look like the line is indeed the ideal line.

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:54.360
And the second reason is because actually the minimization problem that we will get is particularly simple, well posed and it's easy to solve.

00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:57.940
So we'll have a nice formula for the best A and the best B.

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:04.960
So, you know, if you have a method that's simple and gives you a good answer, then that's probably the good one.

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:09.100
So, okay, so we have to define best.

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:17.040
And here it's in the sense of minimizing the total square L.

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:26.520
So, maybe I should say total square deviation.

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:34.080
Okay. So, what do I mean by that?

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:52.280
So, the deviation for each data point is the difference between what you have measured and what you are predicting by your model.

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:59.240
Okay, so that's the difference between yi and axi plus B.

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:02.620
Okay.

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:22.260
So now, what we'll do is we'll try to minimize the function capital D, which is just the sum for all the data points of the square of the data points.

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:39.940
So, let me emphasize again, this is a function of A and B.

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:42.380
I mean, of course, there's a lot of letters in here.

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:46.720
But xi and yi in real life, it will be numbers given to you.

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:48.160
It will be the numbers that you have measured.

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:51.200
You've measured all of these data.

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:52.900
They are just going to be numbers.

00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:57.360
You put them in there and you get a function of A and B. Okay.

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:04.100
Any questions?

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:11.880
Yes?

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:15.560
Okay.

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:20.120
So, how do we minimize this function of A and B?

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:22.840
Well, let's use our new knowledge.

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.080
Let's actually look for a critical point.

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:41.040
So, we want to solve for partial D of a partial A equals zero and partial D of a partial B equals zero.

00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:44.500
That's how we look for critical points.

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:50.140
So, let's take the derivative of this with respect to A.

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:58.280
Well, so it's going to be, well, the derivative of a sum is sum of the derivatives.

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:03.840
And now we have to take the derivative of this quantity squared.

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:08.300
So, remember how we take the derivative of a square.

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:12.580
We take twice this quantity times the derivative of what was squaring.

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:28.380
So, we get two times minus AXI plus B times the derivative of this with respect to A.

00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:30.400
What's the derivative of this with respect to A?

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:32.760
Negative XI, exactly.

00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:36.800
And so we'll want this to be zero.

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:45.280
And partial D of a partial B, we do the same thing, but differentiating with respect to B instead of respect to A.

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:59.380
So, again, sum of squares twice YI minus AXI plus B times derivative of this with respect to B is, I think, negative one.

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:00.040


00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:04.940
So, that's the equations we have to solve.

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:11.300
Well, let's reorganize this a little bit.

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:24.980
So, the first equation.

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:32.840
So, see, there's A's and there's B's in these equations.

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:37.060
I'm going to just look at the coefficients of A and B.

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:42.720
If you have good eyes, you can see that these are actually linear equations in A and B.

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:46.180
Or, there's a lot of clutter with all these X's and Y's, all of other places.

00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:51.960
Okay, so let's actually try to expand things and make that more apparent.

00:39:53.740 --> 00:40:04.340
So, the first thing I will do is I will actually get rid of these factors of two that are interesting, not very important.

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:07.160
I can simplify things by two.

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:10.760
And next, I'm going to look at the coefficient of A.

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:14.800
Well, I will get basically A times XI squared.

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:22.700
Well, let me just do it and it should be clear.

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:41.080
So, I claim when we simplify this, we get XI squared times A plus XI times B minus XIY.

00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:48.200
And we set this equal to zero.

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:54.080
Do you agree that this is what we get when we expand that product?

00:40:57.460 --> 00:40:58.040
Yeah, kind of.

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.360
Okay, let's do the other one.

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:05.320
So, we just multiply by minus one.

00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:06.660
So, we take the opposite of that.

00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:09.400
It will be AXI plus B.

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:15.480
And we'll write that as XXIA plus B minus YI.

00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:23.360
And, oh, sorry, I forgot the N here.

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:30.840
And let me just reorganize that by actually putting all the A's together.

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:39.380
That means actually I will have some of all the XI squared times A plus some of XI times B minus C.

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:41.220
So, I will have XIYI equals zero.

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:08.920
So, if I rewrite this,

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:23.040
it becomes some of XI squared times A plus some of the XI times B minus one.

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:28.680
Let me move the other guys to the other side equals some of XIYI.

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:38.680
And that one becomes some of XI times A plus how many B's do I get?

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:43.120
I get one for each data point.

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:45.780
When I sum them together, I will get N.

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:52.720
So, N times B equals some of YI.

00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:58.260
Now, this quantity is very scary, but they're actually just numbers.

00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:04.000
For example, for this one, you look at all your data points for each of them you take the value of X

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.180
and you just sum all these numbers together.

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:13.140
So, what you get actually is a linear system in A and B.

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:17.780
A 2 by 2 linear system.

00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:30.320
And so, now we can solve this for A and B.

00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:39.340
So, in practice, of course, first you plug in the numbers for XIYI and then you solve the system that you get.

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:43.840
And we know how to solve 2 by 2 linear systems, I hope.

00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:49.260
So, that's how we find the best fit line.

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:54.760
Now, why is that going to be the best one instead of the worst one?

00:43:54.760 --> 00:44:00.280
We just solve for a critical point that could actually be a maximum of this error function D.

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:03.400
Well, so we'll have actually the answer to that next time.

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:10.340
But trust me, if you really want to go through the second derivative test that we'll see tomorrow and apply it in this case,

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:13.600
it's quite hard to check, but you can see it's actually a minimum.

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:17.680
So, I'll just say...

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:25.920
We can show that it's a minimum.

00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:46.380
Okay. Now, even for a linear case is the one that we have the most family on with.

00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:49.980
If this square interpolation actually works in much more general settings.

00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:52.360


00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.500
Because instead of fitting for the backst line, if you think that there's a different kind of relation,

00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:11.740
then maybe you can fit, you know, in using a different kind of formulas.

00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:13.680
So, let me actually illustrate that with an example.

00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:18.740
So, I don't know if you're familiar with Moore's law.

00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:26.900
It's something that's supposed to tell you how quickly basically computer chips become smarter, faster and faster over time.

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:32.480
It's a law that says things about the number of transistors that you can fit onto a computer chip.

00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:36.580
So, here I have some data about...

00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:37.660
Oh.

00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:39.180
Why is that?

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:39.640
Okay.

00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:42.380
So...

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:47.820
Okay. Better.

00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:57.160
So, here's data about the number of transistors on, you know, stand-up PC processor as a function of time.

00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:03.600
And, well, you know, if you try to do the best line fit, well, you'll see quickly that it doesn't seem to follow a linear trend.

00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:04.600
Okay.

00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:12.060
On the other hand, if you plug the diagram in a log scale, you know, with...

00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:17.040
So, the log of the number of transistors as a function of time, then you get a much better line.

00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:28.240
And so, in fact, that means that you had an exponential relation between the number of transistors and time.

00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:30.560
And so, actually, that's what most law says.

00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:33.960
It says that the number of transistors on the chip doubles every...

00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:38.720
So, depending on the version, every 18 months or every two years, they keep changing the statement.

00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:41.540
But...

00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:45.640
So, how do we find that best exponential fit?

00:46:54.320 --> 00:47:04.300
Well, so, an exponential fit would be something of a form y equals a constant times exponential of a times x.

00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:08.760
Okay. That's what we want to look at.

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:15.540
Well, we could try to minimize a square error that we did before, but it doesn't work well at all.

00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:18.640
The equations that you get are very complicated. You can't solve them.

00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:23.780
But, remember what I showed you on this log plot.

00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:32.220
Right? If you plot the log of y as a function of x, then suddenly it becomes a linear relation.

00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:41.680
So, observe, this is the same as ln of y equals ln of c plus a x.

00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:44.740
And that is a linear best fit.

00:47:46.980 --> 00:48:00.780
So, what you do is you just look for the best straight line fit for the log of y.

00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:09.040
So, that's something we already know.

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:11.500
But you can also do other examples.

00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:15.140
For example, let's say that we have something more complicated.

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:19.920
Let's say that we have actually a quadratic log.

00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:25.780
So, for example, y is of a form a x squared plus b x plus c.

00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:30.020
And, of course, you're trying to find somehow the best.

00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:35.580
So, that would mean here fitting the best parabola for your data points.

00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:40.060
Well, to do that you need to find a, b and c.

00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:51.020
And now you would have actually a function of a, b and c, which would be the sum of all data points of the square deviation.

00:48:57.540 --> 00:49:03.400
And, if you try to solve for critical points, so now you will have three equations involving a, b and c.

00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:06.420
And, in fact, you will find a three by three linear system.

00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:08.220
And, it works just the same way.

00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:09.880
Just you have a little bit more data.

00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:25.120
So, basically, you see that these best fit problems are an example of, you know, minimization problem that maybe you didn't expect to see,

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:26.660
minimization problems come in.

00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:28.820
But that's really the way to handle these questions.

00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:41.120
Okay, so tomorrow we'll go back to the question of how do we decide whether it's a minimum or a maximum, and we'll continue exploring some of several variables.
