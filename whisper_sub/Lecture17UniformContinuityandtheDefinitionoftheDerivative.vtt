00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.580
So last time, we finished by proving bosanos intermediate value theorem.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:37.820
Which states that it continues function achieves all values in between the function evaluated

00:00:37.820 --> 00:01:03.600
at the end point. So if I have a continuous function, I take a value y between f of a and f of b.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:13.940
So either f of a is less than f of b and y is bigger than f of a and less than f of b or f of a is bigger than f of b.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:31.280
But y is still in between them. Then there exists c in the interval a, b so that f of c equals y.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.380
So every value in between f, evaluated at the end points, is achieved.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:51.680
I drew the picture along with this a, b, f of a, f of b.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:02:12.820
And that could be the function and if we take anything in between, then there has to be some c so that f of c equals y.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.960
At least in the picture I've drawn there's three different guys but there's always at least one.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:37.020
And then the last thing we talked about at the end of last lecture was that the image of a bounded, closed and bounded interval by a continuous function is again a closed and bounded interval.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:03:05.060
Where e corresponds to the absolute max of f and f corresponds, so that I shouldn't call this f since we already have f being used, and g corresponds to, let's make it d, corresponds to the absolute min of f.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:29.280
So this is what we proved last time is that f of f is continuous then.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:45.580
There exists e, d, and r such that the range of this closed and bounded interval is again closed and bounded interval.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:56.860
So f is very well behaved on closed and bounded intervals and we'll see another way in which continuous functions are well behaved on a closed and bounded interval in just a second.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:11.860
Now, a simple application of the Balsano intermediate value theorem is the following.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:39.340
It's an application of that theorem that I labeled a bisection method but let's chalk that up to the Balsano intermediate value theorem which is the following that if f of x is any odd polynomial, then,

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:49.440
f has at least one real root.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.440
So any odd polynomial has at least one real root.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:10.180
So by the fundamental theorem of algebra, every polynomial has exactly in roots in corresponding to the degree of the polynomial, but these roots can be complex value.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:19.220
But for odd polynomials, there must be at least one real root and this is a consequence of the Balsano intermediate value theorem.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.920
But instead of proving this theorem in its full generality, let me just give you kind of a representative example.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:50.100
So let's take f of x equals x to the 20, 21 minus x to the 20 plus, I don't know, what's today?

00:05:50.100 --> 00:06:01.320
I think the 25th or 24th, I don't know, 1025x minus 300.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.600
So what's the point?

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:19.980
As long as I plug in a big enough x, I will, this will swamp everything here.

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:35.740
So for example, if I stick in f of 100,000, I leave it to you to check that this is positive, right?

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:43.940
Because this will be 100,000 to the 20, 20 minus 100,000 to the 20, 21.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.620
And then plus this, which will be positive minus 300, this doesn't matter.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:07:02.140
So what really matters is this big guy, or this guy with the largest power, will swamp all the other ones and eventually be positive, if I stick in a large enough positive value.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:18.840
And likewise, in fact, for this guy, if I stick in a negative value, then I get something very big.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.600
But now with a minus sign, which will again swamp all these earlier guys.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:28.740
In fact, I don't have to choose minus 100,000. If I just stick in zero, I will get minus 300, which will be negative.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:34.840
But you can check that if I stick in minus 100,000, this will still be negative.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:53.000
Thus by the intermediate value theorem, there exists a C in 100,000, 100,000.

00:07:55.060 --> 00:08:04.800
So that, F of C equals zero, right? Because zero is something in between F evaluated at these two endpoints.

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:23.800
But again, you can prove this, and the idea is the same as long as you go far enough out and positive, then the polynomial will be positive if the coefficient out in front is positive.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:33.120
And if you go far enough out negative, then you'll get something that's negative.

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:37.980
And then you apply the intermediate value theorem to be able to find a root.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:58.080
Now of course, one other thing we did with the statement of the midmax theorem was, can we drop any of the assumptions on this theorem.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:16.380
And you can see that the example is no. So the question is if F from a closed and bounded interval is not continuous.

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:25.340
And let's say, F of zero is less than zero, F of A.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:42.440
F of B is bigger than zero than does there exist C, A, B such that F of C equals zero.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:10:03.340
Okay? Let me put that question mark at the end. All right? And it's easy to come up with an example of a function that is not continuous, that satisfies these conclusions, and there does not exist a point in between so that F of C equals zero.

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:16.480
So, simplest being, I'll just draw a picture. Let's go from minus one, one, two. Okay.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:41.440
So then the function is F of X equals X minus one. And this is for X not equal to one. And let's make it a half there.

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:58.140
So this function looks like half there. Okay, so there is no value. There is no C in between.

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:16.600
So X is between zero and two. So you see F of zero is equal to minus one. That's negative. F of two is equal to one. It's positive. But there exists no C in between.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:32.640
So that F of C equals zero. Okay? So what's the point I'm making? We really do need this hypothesis that the function is continuous for this theorem to be true.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:38.700
Okay? If you drop that hypothesis, then the theorem is no longer true. Okay?

00:11:38.700 --> 00:12:01.700
Okay.

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:21.980
Okay. So now we're going to move on to a new concept called uniform continuity. And before I do this, I'm going to bring up, or I'm going to rewrite the definition of continuity.

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:59.500
So this is an old definition, but I want to highlight a specific aspect of it. So this is me writing the definition of a continuous function again.

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:28.680
So a function F from a set S to R is continuous. So we said that means it's continuous at every point, meaning if we're all C in S, it's continuous at C,

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:56.020
which means for all epsilon positive, there exists a delta. Now this delta, and we saw this in examples that we did proving continuity, this usually depends on epsilon and C, the point where I'm looking at such that

00:13:56.020 --> 00:14:10.340
for all X and S, X minus C, less than delta, implies that F of X minus F of C is less than epsilon. Okay?

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:39.320
So just to, so this is again a bit of review, but I just want to show you that in general, you know, when we verify that a function is continuous on a set, we have to show it's continuous at every point in the set. And that means for every epsilon, there exists a delta, but this delta can depend on, usually depends on epsilon, but it can also depend on the point C, which is where we're checking continuity at.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:15:06.300
Okay? So for a simple example, let's take F of X equals 1 over X on the interval 0, 1, open interval 0, 1. Okay? So I claim F of X equals 1 over X is continuous.

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:24.880
So proof, we have to show that for every C in 0, 1 for all epsilon, there exists that. So let's see B in 0, 1, but epsilon be positive.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:51.620
Now choose, again, I mean, I'm not, since this is kind of review, I'm not going to go through the process of really the thinking behind choosing this, this delta, I mean, there's, you know, calculations you do off to the side to try and get this delta, but let's choose delta to be the minimum of C over 2.

00:15:51.620 --> 00:16:06.680
And C squared over 2 times epsilon. So what you notice, what I want to, again, emphasize is this delta depends on C, the point we're looking at, and epsilon.

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:24.360
Okay? So I claim this delta works. Suppose X is in 0, 1, and X minus C is less than delta. Okay?

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:43.720
Then absolute value of X, this is equal to the app, this is by the triangle inequality. Let me write it this way.

00:16:48.480 --> 00:17:08.320
C, absolute value, is equal to C minus X plus X, which is less than or equal to C minus X plus X, which is less than delta, which is less than or equal to the minimum of these two.

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:22.180
So it's certainly less than or equal to C over 2 plus X, and now, you know, C and X, these are in 0, 1, so they're all positive.

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:31.540
And therefore, I get that, let's go to the next board.

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:53.520
So if I subtract the C over to the other side, I get that, C over 2 is less than X. All right? So this is as long as X is in 0, 1, and X minus C is less than delta.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:18:07.980
Okay? This should not be a shock. All right? Here's 0, 1, C, C over 2, 3, C over 2. Okay?

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:29.860
And so if X is in this interval, it certainly bounded away, I see over 2. Okay? Or if X is in here, then X is certainly bigger than C over 2. All right? And now we look at F of X minus F of C.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:46.320
This is equal to 1 over X minus 1 over C equals C minus X over X times C, which is less than delta over X times C.

00:18:50.420 --> 00:19:07.980
And because this is a... Okay? And now X is less than X is bigger than C over 2. So if I take 1 over that, I get 1 over X is less than 2 over C.

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:25.620
So this is less than or equal to 2 delta over C squared. And delta is the minimum of now C over 2 and C squared over 2 times epsilon. So this is less than or equal to 2 over C squared times C squared over 2, epsilon equals epsilon.

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:55.400
Okay? So I just went through the proof of continuity for 1 over X, which, you know, using better machinery we could have proven. But I did this to highlight this point that showing continuity of 1 over X on 0, 1, that in showing that, you know, this delta that you are choosing depends kind of on the point you're looking at.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:20:15.500
Alright? So now I want to make a... So, you know, what the definition of continuity says is for all C, for all epsilon, you can find a delta depending on epsilon and C.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:31.140
Now, uniform continuity removes that necessity of delta depending on C. Okay? And I'm going to make a possibly bad analogy in just a minute. But first let me write down the definition of uniform continuity.

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:58.660
Let S be subset of R, F going from S to R. We say F is uniformally continuous.

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:21.440
So this on S, if we're all epsilon positive, there exists a delta depending only on epsilon such that we're all X, C, and S with X minus C less than delta.

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:40.420
So, we get that F of X minus F of C is less than epsilon. Okay? So, you know, a function being continuous means that for all epsilon, you can find a delta depending on one of these points, depending on C.

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:49.880
So that if I had this, then I had this. Uniform continuity says you can find a delta that works across the board. Okay?

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:13.380
So I'm going to make a try and make an analogy that hopefully I don't have to cut out of this lecture. But it's a bit like this. Let's take a trip down memory lane and imagine being at a party.

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:30.320
So, you know, everybody's in a party and let's say that everybody can hear their ears work just about the same. And the goal is, you know, to try and understand each other's conversation, trying to hear each other's conversations.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:48.000
Now, in order for, you know, me to hear this person's conversation, depending on how loud they talk, I have to be close enough to be able to hear them. You know, in this changes from person to person in the room.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:23:04.120
Maybe I have to, I can stand a foot away from this person over here. Maybe this person over here is a low talker and I have to be almost up in their face to be able to hear them. Maybe that person just whispers and I have to be almost nose to nose to be able to hear them.

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:19.640
You know, that's a bit like a function being continuous. Okay. You know, the threshold of hearing what they're saying is the epsilon and I have to change my delta depending on what point I'm at so that I can hear them.

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:41.860
Now, uniform continuity is kind of like everybody's more or less speaking around the same level, speaking at the same loudness. All right. So I just can be within, say, one foot of everybody and be able to understand them.

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:59.920
I go to this person if I'm within one foot, I can hear them well. If I go to this person, I hear and within one foot, I can hear them well and so on. All right. So that's kind of the difference between, you know, or at least a loose analogy of the difference between continuity and uniform continuity.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:13.700
All right. So this is a, you know, reasonably interesting definition. So we should see examples and negate it.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:29.900
First off, you know, you should be able to convince yourself that a function that's uniformly continuous is actually continuous. I'm not going to write that the proof of that down. It follows essentially straight from the definition.

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:54.420
But let's look at a function which is uniformly continuous. So the function f of x equals x squared on the interval zero one.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:15.620
So what's the proof? I want you to notice I'm going to use kind of in a very essential way that we're on this closed and bounded interval.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:31.260
So we need to show that for every epsilon there exists a delta so that no matter what two points. So if you like, here's a picture that goes along with this.

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:52.580
So that if I look at need two points that are close to each other less than delta there functions value is within epsilon.

00:25:53.560 --> 00:26:02.420
So let's say I'm on interval a b. But not just this point I could go over here to two other points that are within delta of each other.

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:31.520
So I can move through the party and as long as I'm close enough within a uniform distance to somebody I can hear them just fine.

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:40.120
So what a nice trip down memory lane when we can be around other people.

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:54.500
So let's show this function is uniformly continuous let epsilon be positive. Choose delta to be epsilon over two.

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:59.620
Now you see this delta just depends on epsilon.

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:24.540
Then if x and c are in zero one and x minus c is less than delta then if I compute the difference x squared minus c squared this is I can write as x plus c times x minus c.

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:39.300
And now I use the triangle inequality this is less than or equal to x minus c. Now these guys are in zero one so they're absolute values always bounded by one.

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:54.040
So this is less than or equal to one plus one. And then x minus c is bounded by delta which equals two times delta and delta is chosen to be epsilon over two so I get epsilon.

00:27:55.260 --> 00:28:14.960
Now again how would you choose delta? So it looks like I just chose this delta out of nowhere in practice how do you choose delta this is the computation you do you take x squared minus c squared split it you have this you can estimate with what you know above by two here times delta.

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:23.680
So how do you choose delta so that two times delta is say equal to epsilon you choose delta to be epsilon over two.

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:53.660
So let's negate this definition and then look at one over x once again and check to see if it's uniformly continuous we'll show it's not so the negation f from s to r is not uniform.

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:23.640
So I saw a little bit of the new borat movie that came out so I almost wanted to say f is uniformly continuous not but I saw a little bit of the new borat movie that came out.

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:42.080
I didn't it's not uniformly continuous if and now you negate the rest of the definition if there exists some bad epsilon such that no matter what delta you choose there exists some bad x and c

00:29:46.740 --> 00:30:00.440
s such that they're close to each other but the values are not bigger than or equal to.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:30.420
So let's revisit one over x this is not uniformly continuous on the open interval zero one.

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:34.680
So you see that this function is continuous but it's not uniformly continuous.

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:48.480
So we just proved that a minute ago that it's continuous so let me now give you the proof that this function is not uniformly continuous and what's the idea behind this.

00:30:49.420 --> 00:31:05.860
Here's one. This is not to scale but there's one as well and one over x shoots up to plus infinity as x approaches zero.

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:18.200
So what uniform continuity says is that if I take any two points in the interval that are close to each other then the outputs have to be close to each other.

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:28.140
Continuity remember says if I fix a point then as long as I'm close to that point the outputs will be close to each other.

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:36.780
Uniform says no matter what two points you choose as long as they're close together the outputs will be close together in a controlled way.

00:31:36.780 --> 00:32:06.720
Now if I take two points very close to each other here very close to zero they can be you know pretty close to each other but their differences I mean their values can be quite large even though the difference between the arguments are small.

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:17.320
The values can be quite large just because one over x shoots up so let's quantify this I have to tell you what the bad epsilon not is.

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:40.640
Choose epsilon not equals to now any epsilon not the work just fine let delta be positive so now we have to find x and c in s within distance delta to each other.

00:32:47.960 --> 00:33:06.520
That whose values different differ very by at least two so let's choose c to be the minimum of delta and a half.

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:10.340
I'm going to choose x to be c over two.

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:29.300
So just ignoring this half for a minute c is equal to delta x is equal to delta over two and then one over c minus one over x is going to be two over delta and if delta is very small that's certainly bigger than or equal to two.

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:35.260
But I had to throw in this one half here because I chose epsilon not to be two. And delta is arbitrary.

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:54.460
So then we see that x minus c is equal to c over two which is certainly less than or equal to since c is the minimum of delta and one over half is less than delta over two which is less than delta.

00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:06.500
And if we compute one over x minus one over c this is a.

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:20.300
Remember x is c over two so this one over x is two over c so one over c.

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:32.760
And now from c being less than or equal to one over half I get that one over c is going to be bigger than or equal to two.

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:52.440
Alright. And that's the end of the proof.

00:34:52.440 --> 00:35:07.180
Alright. So we see that even though these two arguments are very close to each other the outputs are in fact separated by some fixed distance at least two.

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:13.540
But we could actually make it you know bigger than three bigger than four whatever you like.

00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:13.860
Alright.

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:29.100
And I'm not going to go over this example.

00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:48.520
But in fact I'll leave it to you or maybe I'll put it on the assignment f of x equals x squared is not uniformly continuous on R.

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:57.580
So we saw that it's uniformly continuous on the closed interval zero one but it's not uniformly continuous on all of R.

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:13.280
The reason being again kind of because you know x squared is starting to get big so I can take two things close to each other stick it into x squared and their outputs could be you know very different from each other.

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:26.640
I didn't write out the proof of this one so we're going to go a little bit by a little bit by the seat of our pants.

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:44.980
So we want to show this is not uniformly continuous so I think epsilon zero equals one is going to work just fine.

00:36:49.980 --> 00:37:14.860
That delta be positive and the idea is we want to choose x to be some number let's call it a plus well c will be some number and c equals some number.

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:36.160
So this is kind of scratch work off to the side and let's see if we can somehow choose c so that so first off you know x minus c will be c over two will be delta over two which is less than delta.

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:51.040
And now let's see if we can choose c so that x squared minus c squared is bigger than or equal to one.

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:10.660
So c is kind of the thing that we get to play with here. I mean this is how it actually goes if you're want to you know figure out the proof before you write it down you know the scratch work to the side.

00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:25.580
Alright so choose c so that this now let's start off with the thing that we're trying to bound from below and start computing some stuff this is equal to x plus c and c will be positive.

00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:54.440
So this will be c and x will be positive so x plus c times x minus c now x plus c will be two c plus delta over two x minus c will be delta over two.

00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:24.460
So so far all of these things are equality and we get this is equal to two c plus delta two c plus delta squared over two and here we're going to choose c positive alright so we're trying to show it's not uniformly continuous on r so we just need to find a value of c and a value of x.

00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:48.400
So that there within delta distance to each other but their outputs are bigger than or equal to one so so far if c is just something positive x is c plus delta over two then they're close their difference however is going to be just by this computation equal to two c plus delta over two times delta over two squared.

00:39:49.800 --> 00:40:08.160
Now delta squared over two is always non-negative so it's certainly bigger than or equal to delta times c and now remember we wanted this thing to be bigger than or equal to one right now we have it's bigger than or equal to delta c so let's choose c to be one over delta.

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:37.420
And let's see that that works choose c to be one over delta x to be one over delta so c plus delta over two then these two values are close x minus c equals delta over two is less than delta.

00:40:39.280 --> 00:41:04.580
And x squared minus c squared equals x plus c times x minus c x plus c as we did a minute ago is going to be two over delta plus delta over two that's x plus c x minus c is equal to delta over two.

00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:13.680
So, this is a number of times x equals one plus delta squared over four which is bigger than or equal to one are bad epsilon.

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:23.580
So, f of x equals x squared is not uniformly continuous on r even though it is uniformly continuous on this closed and bounded interval.

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:41.380
So, uniform continuity is really a relationship between a function and the domain on which it's defined.

00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:54.100
But, okay, so this is kind of to wrap up our theme of continuous functions and how they're behaved and closed and bounded intervals.

00:41:54.820 --> 00:42:01.420
And we see here that uniform continuity is a much stronger notion than continuity as I've said.

00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:09.000
I mean, you can easily prove from the definition that if a function is uniformly continuous on s then it's continuous on s.

00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:19.160
All right. Now, and we've seen that in general the reverse inclusion does not hold.

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:22.800
So, let me just write this up as a remark.

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:46.020
In general, f uniformly continuous implies that f is continuous.

00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:49.380
So, this just follows from the definition. This is not difficult to show.

00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:59.220
But, the converse does not hold.

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:14.280
Okay. As we've just seen, right. We have two examples here.

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:21.180
f of x equals one over x on the open interval zero one which is continuous but it's not uniformly continuous.

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:33.480
And then we have the function f of x equals x squared which is not uniformly continuous on r but in fact it is uniformly continuous on this closed and bounded intervals zero one.

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:49.440
This example here though is in fact the rule that if I'm looking at a continuous function or a function on a closed and bounded interval then in fact these two notions are equivalent.

00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:59.700
So, that's the following theorem. Let f be a function from a to b to r.

00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:15.400
So, a closed and bounded interval now. Now, just an arbitrary set. Then f is continuous on a b meaning it's continuous at every point.

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:27.040
So, if and only if f is uniformly continuous on a b.

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:35.140
And the necessity of working on a closed and bounded interval is seen again by these examples.

00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:41.860
By this example we had here of f of x equals one over x and f of x equals x squared on r and zero one.

00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:50.620
But, as long as we're looking on a closed and bounded interval continuous is equivalent to uniform continuity.

00:44:51.420 --> 00:45:18.260
Now, this is also not the sharpest thing you can say in fact what you can say is that if I replace this with what's called a compact set which I may put in the assignment I may not then the statement is still true and that's in some sense the sharpest statement but I think this is interesting enough to just work on a closed and bounded interval.

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:22.620
So, let's prove this.

00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:46.360
So, again this direction should say I leave this to you as an exercise uniform continuity implying continuity.

00:45:46.360 --> 00:46:10.940
I'll leave it to you. And I will do more difficult one and we'll use use kind of a you know philosophy like we did in the previous lecture where we used the definition of continuity or this theorem about continuity in terms of sequences and also the ballzano virus.

00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:25.580
Okay, good we still have the negation of the definition of uniform continuity and that's what we'll need.

00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:36.720
Alright, so we're going to prove F continuous implies uniformly continuous and we're going to do this by contradiction.

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:45.100
So, suppose F is continuous on AB but not uniformly continuous.

00:46:52.920 --> 00:47:06.440
Alright, and then we're going to break the universe some way.

00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:15.940
Alright, which shows that our assumption that F is not uniformly continuous does not hold.

00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:31.620
Okay, so we use this negation of the definition of uniform continuity which says that there exists a delta zero so let me write this out.

00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:56.580
I'm just going to rewrite this here then there exists a delta zero such that for all delta positive there exists X, C, and AB which depend on delta such that X minus C is less than delta.

00:47:56.580 --> 00:48:08.800
So, F is equal to delta and F of X minus F of C is greater than or equal to epsilon not.

00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:25.020
Okay, now this holds for every delta you can find the X and C so that X minus C is less than delta so F of X minus and F of X minus F of C is greater than or equal to epsilon not.

00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:46.640
So, let's choose delta to be 1 over n for each natural number n and for all natural numbers n there exists X, C, and AB such that.

00:48:46.640 --> 00:49:06.760
So, this is a statement now with delta equals 1 over n X, N minus C, N is less than 1 over N and F of X sub N minus F of C sub N is bigger than or equal to epsilon zero.

00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:34.300
Okay, now I have two sequences here and they're bounded because they're in this closed and bounded interval so I can pass to a subsequent sequence of one of them to start by the boson of virus truss theorem, not BZ, boson of virus truss.

00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:42.300
I think that's probably somewhere else in the lecture or the previous I wrote BZ but I meant BW by bosono virus truss.

00:49:45.300 --> 00:50:12.280
So, this is X sub sequence X, N sub K of X sub N and X in AB such that limit as K goes to infinity of X sub N sub K equals X sub N sub K of X sub N and X sub N sub K of X sub N sub N sub K of X sub N sub N sub K of X sub N sub K of X sub N sub K of X sub N sub K of X sub N sub K of X sub N sub K of X sub N sub K of X sub N sub K of X sub N sub K of X sub N sub K of X sub N sub K of X sub N sub K of X sub N sub K of X sub N sub K of X sub N sub K of X sub N sub K of X sub N sub K of X sub N sub K of X sub N sub K of X sub N sub K of X sub N sub K of X sub N sub K of X sub N sub K of X sub N sub K of X sub N sub K of X sub N sub K of X sub N sub

00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:30.540
Sou, cos'-by-bolzonebirstros from any bounded sequence we can find a convergent sub sequence and because this sub sequence is always between A and B the limit X will be between A and B. No, if I look at

00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:52.480
And since the subsequence C in sub k is bounded between a and b.

00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:59.720
So I have a subsequence of x of n's, and I then obtain a subsequence of the c sub n's

00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:01.720
just picking these integers to be the same.

00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:11.240
And so now that subsequence is of the c sub n is still, you know,

00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:14.020
they're all coming from a b, so that's bounded by a b.

00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:15.660
So it's bounded.

00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:23.160
So by Volzano-Vierstras applied now to this subsequence,

00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:38.600
there exists a subsequence C sub n sub k sub j of C sub n sub k,

00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:59.400
and an element C in a b, such that the limit as j goes to infinity of c sub n sub k sub j equals c.

00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:10.200
So, you know, I found a subsequence of the x of n's, and now I look at kind of a corresponding

00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:18.740
subsequence of the c sub n's where now the subsequence the n sub k's are coming from the n sub k's chosen for this subsequence.

00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:21.220
That's still a bounded sequence.

00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:29.080
So by Volzano-Vierstras, I can take a subsequence of that and an element C so that I have convergence.

00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:30.880
Okay?

00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:34.280
All right.

00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:39.160
So now let me just summarize.

00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:55.960
In summary, let's call these, so in summary,

00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:15.340
the sequence is x sub n sub k sub j.

00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:22.280
So now this is even a subsequence of x sub n sub k and C sub n sub k sub j.

00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:40.340
These are subsequences of the original sequences x sub n and C sub n,

00:53:50.120 --> 00:54:03.860
and there exists x and c in a b such that the limit as j goes to infinity of x of n sub j equals x,

00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:18.820
and limit as j goes to infinity of c sub n sub k j j equals c.

00:54:24.980 --> 00:54:27.000
Now, I claim x equals c.

00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:48.800
Now, C row is certainly bigger than or equal to x of n sub k sub j minus c sub n sub k sub n sub k sub j.

00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:54.680
So j, which is less than or equal to by how we define these sequences,

00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:59.440
is less than or equal to 1 over n sub k sub j.

00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:11.980
And as j goes to infinity, so first off by the definition of subsequences,

00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:18.580
j is always bigger than or equal to n sub k sub j is always bigger than or equal to j.

00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:21.580
So this is always less than or equal to 1 over j.

00:55:22.540 --> 00:55:25.700
This is just a consequence of how subsequences are defined.

00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:34.120
You always have to move to the right after you've made a choice of entry in the sequence that you're going to take as an element of your subsequence.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:44.740
So 0 is bounded, bounds this from below, and is bounded above by 1 over j, which converges to 0.

00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:50.080
So the middle thing has to converge to 0 by the squeeze theorem.

00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:09.100
But these two things, that converges to x, this converges to c.

00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:17.680
And so the absolute value of x minus c equals 0, and therefore x equals c.

00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:30.920
Now we're almost home free.

00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:58.740
The limit is j goes to infinity of x sub in sub k sub j equals c, and limit is j goes to infinity c sub in sub k sub j equals c.

00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:13.480
Now where's the kicker?

00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:17.980
This.

00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:22.580
So these are subsequences of x sub n and c sub n.

00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:31.560
But each of those sequences is converging to a number c.

00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:52.980
So by the theorem about continuity, since f is continuous at c, this implies that 0 equals the limit as j goes to infinity of x sub in sub.

00:57:52.980 --> 00:58:21.140
So this way f of c minus f of c equals limit j goes to infinity of f of n sub c sub in sub k sub j, which is bigger than or equal to epsilon 0.

00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:26.240
All of these are supposed to be bigger than or equal to some fixed epsilon 0, which is positive.

00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:31.040
And, but we've just shown it's equal to zero.

00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:35.560
That's the contradiction.

00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:49.780
Plus, f is uniformly continuous on a b.

00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:52.120
Okay.

00:58:54.860 --> 00:58:55.440
All right.

00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:59.520
So that concludes, you know, what we'll say about continuity.

00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:05.040
And as you'll note kind of going forward, we're going to cover topics faster.

00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:07.960
That's just because we have more machinery to work with.

00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:11.640
You know, at the start it was very slow going just because one,

00:59:14.580 --> 00:59:16.900
it's the start of your first proof-based class.

00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:18.020
So I'm going to go slow.

00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:20.660
And two, we didn't have much to work with.

00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:26.040
We just had the real numbers are in order to field with the least upper bound property.

00:59:26.340 --> 00:59:30.740
But now we've covered sequences, continuity, we know more.

00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:34.980
And it'll be easier to prove new things.

00:59:35.580 --> 00:59:46.560
And also, you know, hopefully familiarity with proof is getting better so that my arguments can be a little bit shorter.

00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:50.100
And not so involved.

00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:53.740
So we're moving on to something now.

00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:57.640
This is supposed to be about calculus.

00:59:58.080 --> 01:00:01.160
We've covered limits, continuity.

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:07.600
The next big topic has to be differentiability.

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:19.100
So this is a new chapter about the derivative.

01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:28.820
So let me first give you the precise definition.

01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:35.100
So first off, I'll be saying,

01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:45.180
okay, let I be an interval,

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:53.640
F goes from I to R, and see an element of I.

01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:57.600
Now when I say an interval, I don't mean it has to be closed and bounded.

01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:01.000
Like, once we've been working on, I don't mean it has to be open.

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:03.880
You know, it doesn't have to be a bounded interval.

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:06.460
Like from 0 to 1, it could be 0 to infinity.

01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:09.660
It can include the endpoints except, of course, infinity.

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:11.960
But I think you know what I mean.

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:15.040
And I don't have to write all this out for what exactly an interval is.

01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:18.440
So let I be an interval and F be a function from I to R.

01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:20.880
And see a point of I.

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:29.820
So first off, you know, convince yourselves of this,

01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:31.760
but I think this should be pretty clear.

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:46.120
For an interval, every point in the interval is a cluster point of the interval.

01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:51.340
Okay? This is not, you know, too difficult to prove.

01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:55.480
But I will not require you to prove it.

01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:58.260
But I'm just saying this because I'm about to define a limit at C.

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:08.240
So it had better be a cluster point of, you know, a set containing of a set

01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:10.980
that this limit is defined using.

01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:16.920
So of I take away C.

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:25.800
And if you don't like this statement, just forget I even wrote it and will continue on.

01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:38.660
You say F is differentiable at C.

01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:43.240
So this is the new bit of terminology.

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:46.700
If the limit.

01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:53.140
X goes to C.

01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:54.760
F of X minus.

01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:58.420
F of C over X minus C.

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:01.880
Exist.

01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:06.300
Okay? If this limit exists, we say the function is differentiable at C.

01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:14.260
And we write, we use a notation.

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:19.400
F prime F, posture Fc for this limit.

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:28.920
Okay?

01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:48.500
F is differentiable at every point of the interval I.

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:49.680
We get a new function.

01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:55.000
This function F prime of C, which we denote by.

01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:18.320
We denote the function that's a derivative of F as F prime or DFDX.

01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:19.620
Okay?

01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:27.960
Okay. So the simplest guys that are differentiable are, of course, polynomials.

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:30.420
I think this is one of the first things you learn back in calculus.

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:38.660
And, you know, I'm not going to go through what this is supposed to represent.

01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:40.020
You know this from calculus.

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:46.960
The best way to say what this number represents is the instantaneous rate of change of the function F at this point.

01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:54.020
How is F changing at that point in the sense of increasing, decreasing, and so on?

01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:06.160
Or if you like, you interpret this as being the slope of the line that is perfectly tangent to the curve to the graph of the function F.

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:12.560
But, you know, what does that mean to be tangent to the graph of the function?

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:15.240
You know, so that takes a bit of explaining.

01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:22.440
So I'm not going to get into what the actual interpretation of this number is.

01:05:22.940 --> 01:05:25.060
I think you have a pretty good idea of what that is.

01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:28.360
We're just going to start proving some properties of it.

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:38.980
So the simplest example of a function which is differentiable is that of a monomial.

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:48.340
So, F of x equals x to the n.

01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:52.360
Let's put even a number in there.

01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:56.200
So let's write it this way.

01:05:56.200 --> 01:06:00.840
I put alpha b in R in the natural number.

01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:02.560
Zero.

01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:17.080
Then, function F of x equals alpha times x to the n is differentiable.

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:27.020
So I should have said here as well if a function is differentiable at every point where it's defined.

01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:34.160
Or if a function is differentiable at every point in its domain i, then we just say the function is differentiable.

01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:37.920
So then this function, this monomial is differentiable.

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:51.620
For all c, F prime of c equals n times alpha x to the n minus 1.

01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:03.880
So let's give a proof of that.

01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:11.020
We'll use this simple formula.

01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:35.500
So let's take a look at x minus c times this kind of weird looking sum to the x n minus 1 minus j c to the j.

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:42.760
So this is equal to multiply the x through.

01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:52.960
I get sum from the equals 0 to n minus 1 x to the n minus j c to the j minus.

01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:58.540
And I'm not going to use j again in the sum when I carry this c through.

01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:15.300
I'm going to use l sum from l equals 0 to n minus 1 x to the n minus, I'll put it this way, j plus 1 c to the j plus 1.

01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:16.300
l.

01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:25.000
Now I'm going to make a change of variables in the second sum.

01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:28.200
Let j equals l plus 1.

01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:40.940
So in that case, when l equals 0, j starts at 1, when l hits n minus 1, j equals n.

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:53.600
So this equals the sum from j equals 0 and minus 1 x n minus j c to the j minus sum, j equals 1 to n.

01:08:55.460 --> 01:08:58.160
x n minus j c to the j.

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:05.000
So it's the same terms in the sum except starting at different places.

01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:09.400
So what doesn't get killed here is the j equals 0 term.

01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:13.760
Because this one starts at j equals 1. This one ends at n.

01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:16.140
And so it kills the n minus 1 term.

01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:19.440
So the only thing that survives from this sum is the j equals 0 term.

01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:23.980
x to the n minus 0 c to the 0 minus.

01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:32.300
And now from here, everything gets killed except the n term.

01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:38.480
So x to the n minus n c to the n equals x to the n minus c to the n.

01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:46.180
So this is therefore equal to this.

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:51.640
So we use this to compute this limit.

01:09:52.480 --> 01:10:06.000
So then f prime of c is equal to the limit as x goes to c of x to the n alpha times x to the n times alpha times c to the n.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.540
Where x minus c, now alpha is just a number.

01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:17.900
It can pop out x to the n minus c to the n divided by x minus c is this thing divided by x minus c.

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:31.000
So this is equal to alpha times the limit as x goes to c of sum from j equals 0 to n minus 1 x to the n minus 1 minus j.

01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:33.460
c to the j.

01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:37.560
Now this is just a polynomial in x.

01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:40.500
Okay? Polynomials are continuous functions.

01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:44.860
So the limit as x goes to c is just you plug in c to x.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:56.360
So this equals alpha times sum from j equals 0 to n minus 1 c to the n minus 1 minus j times j equals.

01:10:56.360 --> 01:11:01.560
So c to the n minus 1 minus j times c to the j gives me c to the n minus 1.

01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:03.200
I'm summing in j.

01:11:03.740 --> 01:11:15.060
There's no j here. So that just pops out times the sum j equals 0 n minus 1.

01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:19.360
And that's just there's n of the times 1.

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:20.560
So this is just n.

01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:24.840
And that's the proof.

01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:29.500
Okay. So I'm sure you saw that at some point.

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:36.940
Next time we'll continue with, we'll give an example of a function which is not differentiable out of a point.

01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:39.940
Of course, I think you probably already know this.

01:11:40.060 --> 01:11:42.360
f of x equals the absolute value of x.

01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:52.360
If there's time at some point, I'll go over an example of a function which was very surprising to people at one point.

01:11:52.820 --> 01:12:04.660
So now that we have differentability and continuity on the board, for a long time, some long since dead people believed that if you have a continuous function,

01:12:07.860 --> 01:12:10.780
then there has to be at least one point where it's differentiable.

01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:15.060
Okay. It must be at least one point where it's differentiable.

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:20.060
And people tried to prove that for a long time and they couldn't because it's false.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:30.460
Vierstras, who is again kind of the godfather of everything we're doing, came up with a whole class of examples of functions that are continuous,

01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:33.320
but are differentiable nowhere.

01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:36.000
Okay. They're not differentiable at a single point.

01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:44.020
And perhaps, depending on time, we'll go over this example.

01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:46.640
And I think I'll stop there.
