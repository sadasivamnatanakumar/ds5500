00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.820
OK, so today we have a new topic.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.780
And we're going to start to learn about vector fields

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.380
and line integrals.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.860
So last week we've been doing double integrals for today,

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.000
we just forget all of that, but don't actually forget it.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.820
You know, put it away in a corner of your mind.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.400
It's going to come back next week.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.300
But what we do today, we're going to do line integrals

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.920
and these are completely different things.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.520
So it helps, actually, if you don't think of double integrals

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.040
at all while doing line integrals.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.760
So we're going to do a lot of things.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.400
So anyway, let's start with vector fields.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.740
So what's a vector field?

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.380
Well, a vector field is something that's of a form.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.380
Well, it's a vector, but where m and n, the components,

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.260
actually depend on x and y, on the point where you are.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:28.420
So there are functions of x and y.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.040
So what that means, concretely, is that at every point

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.500
in the plane, you have a vector.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.220
So in a corn field, everywhere you have corn,

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.220
in a vector field, everywhere you have a vector.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.560
That's how it works.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.460
So a good example of a vector field,

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.420
I don't know if you've seen these maps that show the wind.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.840
But so here's some cool images done by NASA.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.300
So actually, that's a picture of the wind patterns

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.400
of the coast of California with Santa Ana winds.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.280
In case you're wondering what's been going on recently.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.820
So you have all of these vectors that show you

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.180
the velocity of the air, basically, at every point.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.960
I mean, of course, you don't draw it at every point

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.040
because if you draw a vector at absolutely all

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.320
the points of a plane, then you just fill up everything

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.660
and you wouldn't see anything.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.760
So you just choose points and you draw the vectors

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.320
at those points.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.720
So here's another cooling major of, let's take down,

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.600
that's a hurricane of the coast of Mexico

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.380
with the winds spiraling around the hurricane.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.140
So anyway, it's kind of hard to see,

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.640
you don't really see all the vectors.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.980
Actually, I guess the autofocus is having trouble with it.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.120
Yeah, I can't really do it.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.440
So I guess I'll go back to the previous one.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.720
Okay.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.940
So anyway, a vector field is something where,

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.820
at each point,

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.720
in the plane, we have a vector f,

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.440
that depends on x and y.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.820
So this occurs in real life when you look at velocity fields

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:54.400
in a fluid.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.960
For example, the wind, that's what these pictures show.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.640
At every point, you have a velocity of a fluid that's moving.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.740
Another example is force fields.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.920
So now, force fields are not something out of star walls.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.360
It's just, if you look at gravitational attraction,

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.740
you know that if you have a mass somewhere,

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.460
well, it will be attracted to fall down

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.380
because of a gravity field of the Earth,

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.020
which means that at every point, you have a vector

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.860
that's pointing down.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.540
And same thing in space, you have the gravitational field

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.500
of planets, stars, and so on.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.300
So that's also an example of a vector field

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.500
because wherever you go, you would have that vector

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.320
and what it is depends on where you are.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:42.680
So the examples from the real world are things like velocity

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:44.680
in a fluid

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.460
or force field

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.520
where you have a force that depends on the point where you are.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.320
So we're going to try to study vector fields mathematically

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.880
so we won't really care what they are most of the time,

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.080
but as we'll explore with them, define quantities and so on,

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.360
we'll very often use these motivations

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.840
to justify why we would care about certain quantities.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.560
Okay, so the first thing we have to figure out is

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.000
how do we draw a vector field?

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.700
How do you generate a plot like that?

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.300
So let's practice drawing a few vector fields.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.100
Well, let's start with, let's say our very first vector field

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.900
will be just 2i plus j.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.040
So it's kind of a silly vector field

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.260
because it doesn't actually depend on x and y.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.540
So that means it's the same vector everywhere.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.560
Okay, so I take a picture of a plane

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:59.220
and I take a vector 2,1, I guess it points in that direction.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.980
It's 2 units to the right, 1 up.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.680
And I just put that vector everywhere.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.560
Okay, so you know,

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.700
you just put it at a few points all over the place

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.460
and when you think you have enough

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.760
so that you understand what's going on, then you stop.

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.780
So here probably we don't need that many.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.100
I mean, here I think we get the picture.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:21.600
Okay?

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.100
So everywhere we have a vector 2,1.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.820
Now let's try to look at slightly more interesting examples.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.120
Okay, let's say I give you a vector field x times i hat.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.240
Okay, so there's no j component.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.640
So how would you draw that?

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.380
Maybe I don't need that much.

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.580
Well, so first of all,

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.940
we know that this guy is only in the i direction

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.540
so it's always horizontal.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.060
It doesn't have a j component.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.820
So everywhere it would be a horizontal vector.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.600
Now the question is how long is it?

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.320
Well, how long it depends on x?

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.200
So for example, if x is 0,

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.040
then this will be actually the 0 vector.

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.420
So x is 0, but here, see, on the y axis,

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.180
maybe I should take a different corner.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.600
So if I'm on the y axis,

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.400
I actually have the 0 vector.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.880
Now if x becomes positive small,

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.180
then I will have actually a small positive multiple

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:43.520
of i, so I will be going a little bit to the right.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.380
And then if I increase x,

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.860
then this guy becomes larger.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.500
So I get a longer vector to the right.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:55.760
If x is negative, then my vector field points to the left instead.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:56.460


00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:05.560
if it looks something like that.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.800
Any questions about that picture?

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:16.080
No.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.540
So usually we're not going to try to have very accurate,

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:23.820
we won't actually take time to plot the vector field very carefully.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.680
If we need to, computers can do it for us.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:31.640
But it's useful to have an idea of what the vector field does roughly.

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:34.700
Whether it's getting larger and larger in what direction is pointing,

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.520
what are the general features.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.400
So just to do a couple more.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.760
Actually, you'll see very quickly that the examples I take in lecture

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.880
are pretty much always the same ones.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:55.780
So you know, we'll be playing a lot with these particular vector fields,

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:58.180
just because they're good examples.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.200
So let's say I give you x i plus y j.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:07.080
So that one has an interesting geometric signification, the significance.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:16.480
If I take a point x y, you know, so there I want to take the vector x y.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:18.920
How do I do that?

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:23.040
Well, it's the same as the vector from the origin to this point.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:28.580
So I take this vector and I copy it so that it starts at my given point.

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:30.900
So it looks like that.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.400
And you know, same thing at every point.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:47.240
So it's a vector field that's pointing radially away from the origin.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.040
And it's magnitude increases with distance from the origin.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.880
So you don't have to draw, you know, as many as me.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:07.800
But so the idea is this vector field everywhere points away from the origin.

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:10.640
And its magnitude is equal to the distance from the origin.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:16.220
So you know, if this were, for example, velocity fields,

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:20.360
well, that would tell you, you'd see visually what's happening to your fluid.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:24.860
Like here, maybe you have a source at the origin that's pureing fluid out,

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:27.480
and it's flowing all the way away from that.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.560
Okay, let's do just a last one.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:43.540
Let's say I give you minus y, x.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:46.420
What does that look like?

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.240
That's an interesting one.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:57.620
Actually, it's a nice one.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:58.400
So let's see.

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.680
So let's say that I have a point x, y here.

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:06.020
Okay, so this vector here is x, y.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.700
But the vector I want is negative y, x.

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:13.480
So what does that look like compared to?

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.140
Yeah, it's perpendicular to the position to this vector.

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:22.140
Okay, if I rotate this vector, so let me maybe draw a picture on the side.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:31.580
If I take the vector x, y, then the vector with components negative y and x

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:35.360
is going to be like this.

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:41.140
It's the vector that I get by rotating by 90 degrees counterclockwise.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.940
And of course, I don't want to put that vector at the origin.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.960
I want to put it at the point x, y.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.940
So in fact, what I will draw is something like this.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.800
Okay, and similarly here, it would be like that.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:02.540
Like that.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:14.580
And if I'm closer to the origin, then it looks a bit the same, but it's shorter.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:20.620
Okay, and at the origin, it's zero.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:24.140
And when I'm further away, it becomes even larger.

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:28.220
So see, this vector field, if it was the motion of a fluid,

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:33.680
it would correspond to a fluid that's just going around the origin in circles,

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.760
rotating at uniform speed.

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:49.740
Okay, so this is actually the velocity field for uniform rotation.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:13:01.920
And if you figure out how long does it take for a particular fluid to go all the way around,

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:09.060
well, that will be actually 2 pi because the length of the circle is 2 pi times the radius.

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:13.220
So that's actually at unit angular velocity.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.380
One radian per second, or per unit time.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:25.700
Okay, so that's why this guy comes up quite a lot in real life.

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:31.860
Okay, and you know, you can imagine lots of variations on these.

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:36.620
Of course, you can also imagine vector fields given by much more complicated formulas,

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:38.480
and then you'll have a hard time drawing them.

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.620
So maybe you'll use a computer, or maybe you'll just give up,

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:46.760
and just do whatever calculation you have to do without trying to visualize the vector field.

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:54.240
But if you have a nice simple one, then it's worth doing it because sometimes it will give you insight about what we're going to compute next.

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:59.320
Okay, any questions first about these pictures?

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:03.800
No?

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:08.660
Okay, oh, yes.

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:12.700
Sorry?

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:24.680
Why, and you're asking if it should be Y, and so Y, or negative X, I think would be the other way around.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:32.800
See, for example, if I'm at this point, then Y is positive and X is zero.

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:39.240
So if I take Y negative X, I guess a positive first component, and zero for the second one.

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:44.320
So Y, negative X, would be a rotation at unit speed in the opposite direction.

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:45.260
Okay?

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.400
So, yeah, and there's a lot of tweaks you can do to it.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.440
So if you flip the sides, you get rotation in V over direction.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:55.360
Yes?

00:14:58.560 --> 00:14:59.680
How do I know?

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.680
How do I know that it's a unit angular velocity?

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:13.380
Well, that's because if my angular velocity is one, then that means that the speed, the actual speed, is equal to the distance from the origin.

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:22.300
Right? Because the length, I mean, the arc length on a circle of a certain radius is equal to the radius times the angle.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:29.320
So if the angle varies at rate one, then I travel at speed equal to the radius, and that's what I do here.

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:33.060
The length of this vector is equal to the distance from the origin.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:42.500
I mean, it's not obvious on the picture, but really the vector that I put here is the same as this vector rotated, so it has the same length.

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:45.960
So that's why the angular velocity is one.

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:50.580
It doesn't really matter much anyway, but...

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:54.800
Okay.

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:58.800
So now, what are we going to do with vector fields?

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:07.540
Well, we're going to do a lot of things, but let's, you know, let's start somewhere.

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:13.180
So one thing you might want to do with a vector field is...

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:17.180
So I'm going to think for now of the situation where we have a force.

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:18.100
Okay?

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:37.520
So if you have a force exerted on a particle, and that particle moves on some trajectory, then probably you've seen in physics that the work done by the force corresponds to the force dot product with the distance.

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:40.740
The displacement vector, how much you have moved your particle.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:47.680
And of course, if you do just, you know, straight line trajectory, or if the force is constant, that works well.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:55.180
But if you're moving on a complicated trajectory and the force keeps changing, then actually you want to integrate that over time.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:57.640
So...

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:08.060
Okay, so we're going to, the first thing we'll do is learn how to compute the work done by a vector field.

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:12.740
And mathematically, that's called a line integral.

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.120
Okay?

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:25.780
So physically, remember, the work done by a force is the force times the distance.

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:34.280
And more precisely, it's actually the dot product between the force as a vector.

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:41.020
And the displacement vector for a small motion.

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:50.840
So, say that, you know, your point is moving from here to here, you have the displacement delta R that's just the change in the position vector.

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:53.580
If it's the vector from the old position to the new position.

00:17:54.500 --> 00:18:00.500
And then you have your force that's being exerted, and you do the dot product between them.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:04.680
And that will give you the work of the force during this motion.

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:14.200
And the physical significance of this, well, the work tells you basically how much energy you have to provide to actually perform this motion.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.520
Okay? Just in case you haven't seen this in 801 yet.

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:21.160
I'm hoping all of you have heard about work somewhere.

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:25.340
But in case it's completely mysterious, that's the amount of energy you have to provide.

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.800
Sorry, actually, no, that's the amount of energy provided by the force.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:36.400
So if the force goes along the motion, it actually pushes the particle, it provides energy to it to do that motion.

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:43.480
And conversely, if you're trying to go against the force, then you have to provide energy to the particle to be able to do that.

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:54.840
So in particular, the work, you know, if this is the only force that's taking place, then the work will be the variation in kinetic energy of the particle along the motion.

00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:00.000
So now that's a good description for a small motion.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:05.040
But let's say that my particle is not just doing that, but you know, it's doing something complicated.

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:11.780
And my force keeps changing. So somehow maybe, you know, I have a different force at every point.

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:18.060
So then I want to find the total work done along the motion.

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:23.700
Well, what I have to do is I have to cut my trajectory into these little pieces.

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:29.640
You know, and for each of them, I have a vector along the trajectory.

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.880
I have the force. I do the dot product, and I sum them together.

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:45.940
And of course, the actual answer, well, to get the actual answer, I should actually cut into smaller and smaller pieces and sum all of the small contributions to work.

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:47.860
So in fact, it's going to be an integral.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:20:04.100
Okay. So along some trajectory, let's call C the trajectory for curve.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:05.660
You know, it's some curve.

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:33.900
And here, the work adds up to an integral, which, well, we've write this using the notation integral along C of f dot dL.

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:36.100
Okay. So we have to decode this notation.

00:20:40.180 --> 00:21:02.900
So one way to decode this is to say it's a limit as we cut into smaller and smaller pieces of the sum of each piece of the trajectory of the force at the given point dot product with that.

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:05.280
And that's a small vector along the trajectory.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.240
And, well, that's not how we need to compute it.

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:16.940
You know, to compute it, we do things differently.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:19.240
So how can we actually compute it?

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:31.420
Well, what we can do is say that actually we are cutting things into small time intervals.

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:37.140
So the way that we split our trajectory is we just take, you know, a picture every, say, millisecond.

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:40.060
So every millisecond we have a new position.

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:52.560
And the motion, you know, the amount by which you have moved during each small time interval is basically the velocity vector times the amount of time.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:22:04.660
So, in fact, let me just provide this as you know, you do the dot product between the force and how much you have moved.

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:17.420
Well, if I just provide it this way, nothing's happened, but what this thing is actually is the velocity vector.

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:41.660
So what I'm trying to say is that I can actually compute my integral by integrating f dot product with the Rdt over time.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:53.440
From time, you know, whatever the initial time to whatever the final time is, I integrate f dot product velocity dt.

00:22:55.680 --> 00:23:02.120
And of course, I mean, here when I say f, I mean f at the point on the trajectory at time t.

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:07.460
Right. This guy depends on x and y, therefore it depends on t.

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:15.840
Okay, I see a lot of confused faces. So let's do an example. And then I will ask you.

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:17.200
Okay.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.100
So now, yes, that would be probably.

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:29.440
So here I need to put a limit as delta t tends to zero.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:38.920
So I cut my trajectory into smaller and smaller time intervals. For each time interval, I have a small motion, which is essentially velocity times delta t.

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.780
And then I dot that with a force. And I sum them.

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:46.820
Okay. So let's do an example.

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:50.700
Let's say that we do.

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:57.120
We want to find the work of this force.

00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:07.000
So I guess that's the last example that we had. So it's a force field that tries to make everything in the rotate somehow your first points along these circles.

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:15.860
And let's say that our trajectory, our particle is moving along the parametric curve.

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:22.300
x equals t, y equals t squared. For t going from zero to one.

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:28.780
Okay. So what that looks like, what maybe I should draw in your picture.

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:32.120
So our vector field.

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:46.660
Well, whatever. And our trajectory, if you try to plot this, when you see y is actually x squared.

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:52.520
So it's a piece of parabola that goes from the origin to one one.

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:56.020
Okay. That's what our curve looks like.

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:02.300
Okay. So we're trying to find the work done by our force along this trajectory.

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:09.260
I should point out, I mean, you know, if you're asking me, how did you get this? That's actually the wrong question.

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:14.480
I didn't, you know, this is all part of the data. I have a force and I have a trajectory.

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:17.040
And I want to find what's the work done along the trajectory.

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:20.240
These two guys I can choose completely independently of each other.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:38.800
So the integral along c of f dot dr will be, well, it's the integral from time zero to time one of f dot velocity vector dr dt.

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:48.800
So that will be the integral from zero to one of, okay, let's try to figure it out.

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:51.260
So what is f?

00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:00.560
f at a point xy is minus y comma x.

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:06.140
But if I take the point where I am at time t, then x is t and y is t squared.

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:14.980
Okay. So here I plug x equals t, y equals t squared, but will give me negative t squared and t.

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:20.620
Okay. So here we'll put negative t squared t dot product.

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:22.440
What is the velocity vector?

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:28.700
Well, dx dt is just one.

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:32.900
The y dt is 2t.

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:38.060
So the velocity vector is 1 and 2t dt.

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:46.520
Okay. So now we have to continue calculation.

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:51.420
We get integral from zero to one of what is this dot product?

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:54.480
Well, it's negative t squared plus 2t squared.

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:56.360
I get t squared.

00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:02.000
Well, maybe I'll write it negative t squared plus 2t squared dt.

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:11.100
But ends up being integral from zero to one of t squared dt, which you all know how to integrate and get one third.

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:12.540
Okay.

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:18.600
So that's the work done by the force along this curve.

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:19.340


00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:27.860
Well, I got it by just taking the dot product between the force and the velocity.

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:29.100
Okay.

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:32.660
Sorry. That's in case you're wondering.

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:34.940
Things go like this.

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:45.740
Okay. Any questions on how we did this calculation?

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:51.220
No? Yes?

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:55.080
I can't just do the first thing.

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.860
Why can't you just do F dot dR?

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:02.520
Well, soon we'll be able to.

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:06.400
We don't know yet what dR means or how to use it as a symbol.

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:11.320
Okay. Because, you know, we haven't said yet.

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:16.520
I mean, see, this is a d vector R that's kind of a strange thing to have.

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.400
And certainly R is not a usual variable.

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:23.260
I mean, we have to be careful about, you know, what other rules?

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:24.340
What does the symbol mean?

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.700
So, I mean, we're going to see that right now.

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:31.100
And then we can do it actually in a slightly more efficient way.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:35.380
But you can't just use, I mean R is not a scalar quantity.

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:36.820
R is a position vector.

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:39.900
Right? So you can't integrate F with respect to R.

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:41.380
We don't know how to do that.

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:47.600
Okay.

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:51.680
So, oh, yes. Sorry.

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:54.620
I can't see people up there because of the spotlight, but, yes.

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:58.220
If I were to do.

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:02.480
Sorry. I still can't hear you, sorry.

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:14.640
Okay. So, question is, if I took a different trajectory from the origin to that point one, one, what would happen?

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.560
Well, the answer is I would get something different.

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:20.620
Okay. So, for example, let me try to convince you of that.

00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:23.320
For example, say that I chose.

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:30.140
Say I chose to instead go like this and then around like that.

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:36.080
Then, you know, first, I wouldn't do any work because here the force is perpendicular to my motion.

00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:39.760
And then I would be going against the force all the way around.

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:41.440
So, I should get something that's negative.

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:46.980
Okay. Even if you don't see that, just, you know, accept that phase value, what I'm going to say now.

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:53.000
The value of a line integral in general depends on how we got from point A to point B.

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:58.320
And that's why we have to compute it by using the parametric equation for the curve.

00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:01.020
It really depends on what curve you choose.

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:14.940
Okay. Any other questions?

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:15.880
Oh, yes.

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:24.680
So, yes. What happens when the force inflakes the trajectory?

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:28.400
Well, then actually you'd have to solve a differential equation,

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:32.060
telling you how the particle moves to find what the trajectory is.

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:36.700
So, that's something that would, you know, be a very useful topic.

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:41.780
And that's probably more like what you will do in 1803, or maybe you actually know how to do it in this case.

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:50.040
So, what we're trying to develop here is a method to figure out if we know what the trajectory is, what the work will be.

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.380
It doesn't tell us what the trajectory will be.

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.240
But of course, we could also find that.

00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:01.580
But here I see I'm not assuming, for example, that the particle is moving just based on that force.

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:05.960
Maybe actually I'm here to, you know, hold it in my hand and force it to go where it's going.

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:09.900
Or maybe there's some rail that's taking it on that trajectory or whatever.

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:13.980
So, I can really do it along any trajectory.

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:19.820
And if I wanted to, if I knew that it's the case, then I could try to find the trajectory based on what the force is.

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:21.660
But that's not what we are doing here.

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:26.080
Okay.

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:32.960
So, next.

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:37.120
Okay. So, let's try to make sense.

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:43.280
You asked, if you want to go, just a few minutes ago, what can we do directly with dr?

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.180
So, dr c becomes somehow a vector.

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:54.560
I mean, when I replace it by dr dt times dt, it becomes something that's a vector that with a dt next to it.

00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:58.800
So, in fact,

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:07.040
well, it's not really new, but let's see, another way to do it.

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:16.520
Let's say that our force has components m and n.

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:26.880
I claim that we can write symbolically vector dr stands for, it's a vector whose components are dx and dy.

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.480
So, now that's a strange kind of vector.

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:32.180
I mean, it's not a real vector, of course.

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:35.160
But as a notation, it's a pretty good notation.

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:46.280
Because it tells us that f dot dr is m dx plus n dy.

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:55.180
And so, in fact, well, very often, right, instead of f dot dr, n integral, long c,

00:32:55.720 --> 00:33:00.860
we'll write the line integral, long c, of m dx plus n dy.

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:09.100
And so, in this language, of course, what we're integrating now, rather than a vector field, becomes a differential.

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:12.460
But you should think of the two as being pretty much the same thing, right?

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:18.380
It's like when you compare the gradient of a function, and it's differential, they're different notations, but they have the same content.

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:26.260
Okay, so now, that still remains the question, how do we compute this kind of integral?

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:30.560
Because it's more subtle than the notation suggests, right?

00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:33.740
Because m and n both depend on x and y.

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:41.360
And if you're just integrated with respect to x, you'd be left with y's in there, and you don't want to be left with y's.

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:42.420
You want a number at the end.

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:47.380
And so, the catch is along the curve, x and y are actually related to each other.

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:57.980
So, whenever we write this, we have two variables x and y, but in fact, along the curve c, we have only one parameter.

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:02.340
Could be x, could be y, could be time, whatever you want.

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:09.040
But we have to actually express everything in terms of that one parameter, and then we get a usual single variable integral.

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:16.160
Okay, so how do we evaluate things in this language?

00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:20.920
Well, we do it by substituting a parameter into everything.

00:34:47.500 --> 00:35:03.100
Okay, so the method to evaluate is to express x and y in terms of a single variable.

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:15.240
And then substitute that variable.

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:24.540
Okay, so let's, for example, redo the one we had up there just using these new notations.

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:27.500
You'll see it's the same calculation that with different notations.

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:42.940
So, in that example that we had, our vector field f was negative y, x.

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:48.720
So, what we're integrating is negative y dx plus x dy.

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:56.900
Okay, and see if we have just this, we don't know how to integrate that.

00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:02.980
I mean, well, you could try to come up with like negative x, y or something like that, but that actually doesn't make sense.

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:03.700
It doesn't work.

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:19.340
So, what we'll do is we'll actually have to express everything in terms of a same variable, because it's a single integral.

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:20.460
We should have only one variable.

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:26.440
And what that variable will be, well, if we just do it the same way, that would just be t.

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:31.640
So, how do we express everything in terms of t?

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:36.040
Well, we use the parametric equation.

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:41.100
We know that x is t and y is t squared.

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:46.380
Okay, so we know what to do with these two guys.

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:47.880
What about dx and dy?

00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:49.820
Well, it's easy, we just differentiate.

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:52.280
dx becomes dt.

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:56.460
dy becomes 2t dt.

00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:06.340
Okay, I'm just saying in a different language, what I said of other with dx dt equals 1, dy dt equals 2t.

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:09.880
It's the same thing, but written slightly differently.

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:15.640
So, now, so I'm going to do it again.

00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:18.860
I'm going to switch from one board to the next one.

00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:34.860
My integral becomes the integral over c of negative y is minus t squared dt plus x is t times dy is 2t dt.

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:49.500
Okay, and now that I have only t left, it's fine to say, oh, I have a usual single variable integral of a variable t that goes from 0 to 1.

00:37:50.140 --> 00:38:01.300
So now I can say, yes, this is the integral from 0 to 1 of that stuff, where I can simplify a bit, becomes just t squared dt, and I can compute it.

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:08.860
I have negative t squared, and then I have plus 2t squared, so I end up with positive t squared.

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:11.820
Okay, it's the same as up there.

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:17.620
Okay, any questions?

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:20.320
Yes?

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:27.040
When you derive the equation, when you derive the equation, when you derive the equation, where is the equation?

00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:30.200
When you do dy, so what is dy?

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:35.820
dy is the derivative of y, it's the differential of y, y is t squared, so I get 2t dt.

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:42.160
So, I plug dt for dx, I plug 2t dt for dy, and so on.

00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:46.880
Okay, and that's the general method.

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:55.620
So, if you are given a curve, then you first have to figure out how do you express x and y in terms of the same thing?

00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:00.120
And you get to choose in general what parameter we use.

00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:03.080
You choose to parameterize your curve in whatever way you want.

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:33.060
So, the note that I want to make is that this line integral depends on the trajectory, c, but not on the value of y,

00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:33.880
but on the parameterization.

00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:42.760
Okay, so you can choose whichever variable you want.

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:59.060
So, for example, what you could do is, you know, when you know that you have a trajectory, you could also choose to parameterize it as x equals, say, I don't know, x equals sine theta,

00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:12.240
and y equals sine squared theta, because y is x squared, where theta goes from 0 to pi over 2, and then you could get dx and dy in terms of d theta,

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:17.480
and you'd be able to do it with a lot of trig, and you would get the same answer.

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:20.660
So, that would be a harder way to get the same thing.

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:29.440
Okay, so what you should do in practice is use, you know, the most reasonable way to parameterize your curve.

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:35.760
If you know that here you have a piece of parabola y equals x squared, there's no way you will put sine and sine squared, you know.

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:39.840
You could set, I mean, x equals t y equals t squared is very reasonable.

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:43.820
You can even take a small shortcut and say that your variable will be just x.

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:55.100
So that means x, you just keep it, you know, as it is, and then when you have y, you set y equals x squared, dy equals 2x dx, and then you have an integral of your x.

00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:56.440
That works.

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:03.340
Okay, so this one is not practical,

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:11.140
but you know, you get to choose.

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:46.780
Okay, so now let me tell you a bit more about the geometry.

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:59.580
So, we've said, you know, here's how we compute it in general, and that's the general method for computing a line integral for work.

00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:08.000
You can always do this, try to find a parameter, the simplest one, express everything in terms of that variable, and then you have an integral to compute.

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:14.020
But sometimes you can actually save a lot of work by just thinking geometrically about what this all does.

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:21.620
Okay, so let me tell you about the geometric approach.

00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:33.100
So, one thing I want to remind you of first is what is this vector dr?

00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:36.720
Well, what is vector delta r?

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:45.400
You know, if I take a very small piece of a trajectory, then my vector delta r will be tangent to the trajectory.

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:54.800
So, it will be going in the same direction as the unit tangent vector t, and what is its length?

00:42:55.760 --> 00:43:01.980
Well, its length is the arc length along the trajectory, which is what we called delta s.

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:04.740
Remember s was distance along the trajectory.

00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:17.540
So, we can write vector dr, so we say it's dx comma dy, but that's also t times ds.

00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:29.140
It's a vector whose direction is tangent to the curve, and whose length element is actually the arc length element.

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:39.740
I mean, if you don't like this notation, think about divide everything by dt.

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:44.280
Then what we are saying is dr dt, that's a velocity vector.

00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:49.680
Well, it coordinates the velocity vector is dx dt dy dt.

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:58.140
But more geometrically, the direction of a velocity vector is tangent to the trajectory, and its magnitude is,

00:43:58.270 --> 00:44:01.390
speed ds dt.

00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:08.090
So, that's really the same thing.

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:28.170
So, if I say this, that means that my line integral, after dr, well, I say that I can write it as integral of mdx plus mdy,

00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:32.110
that's what I will do if I want to actually compute it by computing the integral.

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:39.470
But if instead I want to think about it geometrically, I could rewrite it as f dot t ds.

00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:47.050
So now you can think of this, f dot t is a scalar quantity.

00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:54.650
It's the tangent component of my force, so I take my force and I project it to the tangent direction to the trajectory.

00:44:54.650 --> 00:44:57.890
And then I integrate that along the curve.

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:00.890
It's still the same thing.

00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:06.090
And sometimes it's easier to do it this way.

00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:08.130
So here's an example.

00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:19.950
Let's say, so you know, this is bound to be easier only when the field and the curve are relatively simple and have a geometric relation to each other.

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:28.890
If I give you an evil formula with x cubed plus y to the fifth or whatever, there's very little chance that you will be able to simplify it that way.

00:45:29.590 --> 00:45:39.610
But let's say that I'm doing, say, my trajectory is just a circle of radius a centred at the origin.

00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:43.530
Let's say I'm doing that counterclockwise.

00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:55.770
And let's say that my vector field is x i plus y g.

00:45:57.390 --> 00:45:58.730
So what does that look like?

00:46:00.070 --> 00:46:05.790
Well, so my trajectory is just this circle.

00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:13.450
My vector field, remember x i plus y g, that's the one that's pointing, radially, from the origin.

00:46:16.090 --> 00:46:20.430
So hopefully if you have good physics intuition here, you already know what the work is going to be.

00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:26.050
It's going to be zero because the force is perpendicular to the motion.

00:46:30.210 --> 00:46:39.050
Well, now we can say it directly by saying, well, if we take any point of the circle, sorry.

00:46:40.890 --> 00:46:50.410
So if you have any point of the circle, then the tangent vector to the circle will be tangent, well, it's tangent to the circle.

00:46:50.410 --> 00:46:59.770
So that means it's perpendicular to the radial direction, while the force is pointing in the radial direction.

00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:02.390
So you have a right angle between them.

00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:10.930
So f is perpendicular to t.

00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:15.250
So f dot t is zero.

00:47:15.930 --> 00:47:20.490
And the line integral of f dot t ds is just zero.

00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:27.710
See, that's much easier than writing, well, this is integral of x d x plus y d y.

00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:33.230
What do we do? Well, we probably set x equals a cosine theta, y equals a sine theta.

00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:36.250
We get a bunch of trig things. Oh, it cancels out to zero.

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:42.190
It's not much harder, but we saved time by not even thinking about how to parameterize things.

00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:47.050
Let's just do a last one. That was the first one.

00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:52.410
Let's say now that I take the same curve, see.

00:47:55.310 --> 00:47:57.670
But now my vector field is the one that rotates.

00:48:00.290 --> 00:48:02.510
Negative yi plus xj.

00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:18.610
Okay, so that means along my circle, the tangent vector goes like this.

00:48:20.010 --> 00:48:25.950
And my vector field is also going around.

00:48:25.950 --> 00:48:31.610
So in fact, at this point, the vector field will also be going in the same direction.

00:48:35.610 --> 00:48:42.730
So now f is actually parallel to the tangent direction.

00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:51.210
So that means that the dot product f dot t, remember, that's the component of f in this direction.

00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:53.990
That will be the same as the length of f.

00:48:56.170 --> 00:49:00.850
But what's the length of f on this circle if this radius is a?

00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:05.210
It's just going to be a. That's what we said earlier about this vector field.

00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:09.490
So at every point, this dot product is a.

00:49:09.890 --> 00:49:12.550
Now we know how to integrate that quite quickly.

00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:28.590
Because that becomes the integral of a ds, but a is a constant.

00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:30.730
So we can take it out.

00:49:31.370 --> 00:49:34.250
And now what do we get when we integrate ds along c?

00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:37.590
Well, we should get the total length of a curve.

00:49:37.810 --> 00:49:47.470
If we sum all the little pieces of our length, but we know that the length of the circle of radius a is 2 pi a.

00:49:47.950 --> 00:49:49.590
So we get 2 pi a squared.

00:49:51.370 --> 00:50:01.470
If we were to compute that by hand, what would we do with set?

00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:06.430
So we would be computing integral of minus y dx plus x dy.

00:50:07.210 --> 00:50:16.750
We'd probably set since we're on a circle, x equals a cos theta, y equals a sine theta for theta between 0 and 2 pi.

00:50:18.090 --> 00:50:21.370
So then we would get dx and dy out of this.

00:50:23.890 --> 00:50:27.350
So y is a sine theta.

00:50:28.410 --> 00:50:30.990
dx is negative a sine theta d theta.

00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:35.170
If you differentiate a cosine plus a cos theta.

00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:38.290
A cos theta d theta.

00:50:39.890 --> 00:50:49.270
Well, you'll just end up with integral from 0 to 2 pi of a squared times sine square theta plus cosine square theta.

00:50:50.610 --> 00:50:52.750
The theta, that becomes just 1.

00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:54.290
And you get the same answer.

00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:58.170
It took about the same amount of time because I did this one rushing very quickly.

00:50:58.910 --> 00:51:04.350
But normally it takes about, you know, at least twice the amount of time to do it with a calculation.

00:51:04.350 --> 00:51:07.510
So that tells you sometimes it's worth thinking geometrically.
