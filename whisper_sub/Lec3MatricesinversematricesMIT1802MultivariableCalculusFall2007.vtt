00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.600
So OK, so remember last time.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.260
We learned about the cross product of vectors in space.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.340
So remember the definition of cross product

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.540
is in terms of this determinant.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.580
I had j hat k hat and then the components of a, a1, a2, a3,

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.680
and then the components of b.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.580
And this is not an actual determinant,

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.900
because these are not numbers, but it's a symbolic notation

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.500
to remember what the actual formula is.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.520
The actual formula is obtained by expanding the determinant.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:19.120
So we have actually this smaller determinant, a2, a3, b2, b3,

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.660
times i hat, minus the determinant of a1,

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:33.880
a3, b1, b3, times j hat, plus determinant of a1, a2, b1,

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.180
b2, times k hat.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.440
And we also saw a more geometric definition of a cross product.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:54.140
So we've learned that the length of a cross product

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:03.620
is equal to the area of the parallelogram with sides a and b.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.320
We've also learned that the direction of a cross product,

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.360
is given by taking the direction that's perpendicular

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.860
to a and b.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.260
So in fact, if I draw a and b in a plane,

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.700
the determinant plane together, then the cross product

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.280
should go in the direction that's perpendicular to that plane.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.480
Now, there's two different possible directions

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.800
that are perpendicular to a plane.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.800
And to decide which one it is, we use the right hand rule,

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.820
which says if you extend your right hand in the direction of vector a,

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.400
then curve your fingers in the direction of b, then your thumb

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.380
will go in the direction of the cross product.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.440
So one thing I didn't quite get to say last time

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.560
is that there are some funny manipulation rules.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.580
What are we allowed to do or not do with cross products?

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.600
So let me tell you right away the most surprising one,

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.580
maybe if you've never seen it before, it's that a cross b

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.660
and b cross a are not the same thing.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.480
Why are we not the same thing?

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.260
Well, one way to see it is to think geometrically.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.980
Sure, the parallelogram still has the same error,

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.380
and it's still in the same plane, so it's still perpendicular

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.340
to the same plane.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.500
But what happens is if you try to apply the right hand rule

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.980
but exchanging the rules of a and b, then you will either enjoy

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.800
yourself or you will end up pointing in the opposite direction.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:14.240
So in fact, b cross a and a cross b are opposite to each other.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.540
And you can check that in the formula,

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.800
because, for example, the i component is a2b3-a3b2,

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.700
if you swap the rules of a and b, you will also have to change the signs.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.860
So that's a slightly surprising thing,

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.520
but you'll see one easily adjusts to it.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.300
It just means resist the temptation to write a, b, equals b, a.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.140
Whenever you do that, put a minus sign.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.820
Now, in particular,

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.780
well, what happens if I do a cross a?

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.060
Well, I will get zero.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.280
And there's many ways to see that when it's to use a formula.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.640
Also, you can say just that the parallelogram from a and a

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.280
is completely flat and it has a real zero.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.960
So that's the zero vector.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.340
So hopefully you got practice with cross products and computing them in recitation yesterday.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.220
Let me just point out one important application of cross products

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.740
that maybe you haven't seen yet.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.960
So let's say that I'm given three points in space

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.340
and I want to find the equation of the plane that contains them.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.800
So say I have p1, p2, p3, three points in space.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.600
Well, the determinant plane, I mean at least if they're not aligned.

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.300
And we would like to find the equation of the plane that the determinant.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.040
So that means, let's say that we have a point p in space

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.660
with coordinates x, y, z.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.240
Well, the equation of the plane.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.820
Let's say the plane containing p1, p2, and p3.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:24.280
So that means we need to find a condition on the coordinate x, y, z.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.040


00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.860
Telling us whether p is in the plane or not.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.600
So we have several ways of doing that.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.320
For example, one thing we could do,

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.380
let me just backtrack to the determinants that we saw last time.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:57.380
So one way to think about it is to consider this vector as p1, p2,

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.860
p1, p3, and p1, p.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.760
So the question of whether they're all in the same plane

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:11.080
is the same as asking ourselves whether the parallel epiped that they form

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.780
is actually completely flattened.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.940
If I try to form a parallel epiped with these three sides,

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.300
well, if p is not in the plane, then it will have some volume.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.120
But if p is in the plane, that means that it's actually completely squished.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:33.080
So one possible answer, one way to think of the equation of the plane

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.000
should be that the determinant of these vectors should be zero.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:45.980
The determinant of p1, p2, p1, p3, and actually let me do it in a different order.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:46.760
It doesn't really matter.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:59.300
So one possible way to express the condition that p is in the plane

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.220
is to say that the determinant of these three vectors has to be zero.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:06.640
And if I'm given coordinates for these points, I mean, I'm not giving you numbers,

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:11.040
but if I gave you numbers, then you would be able to plug these numbers in.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.940
So you could compute these two vectors explicitly.

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:15.640
You would have numbers here.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.900
But here, of course, this would depend on x, y, and z.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.860
So when you compute the determinant, you get a formula that involves x, y, and z,

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:28.540
and you will find that this condition on x, y, z, that's the equation of the plane.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.400
So we're going to see more about that pretty soon.

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:36.120
Now let me tell you about a slightly faster way of doing it.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:38.780
Actually, it's not much faster.

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:42.480
It's pretty much the same calculation, but it's maybe more enlightening.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.340
I'll show you a nice color picture that I prepared for this.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:51.800
Okay.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.220
So, right.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:02.100
So one thing that's on this picture that I have on the down there is the normal vector to the plane.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.160
So why is that?

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:08.480
Well, let's say that we know how to find a vector that's perpendicular to our plane.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.140
Then what does it mean for the point p to be in the plane?

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:19.500
Well, it means that the direction, say, from p1 to p, has to be perpendicular to this vector n.

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:22.420
Okay.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.700
So here's another solution.

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.420
So p is in the plane.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:50.800
Only one, well, exactly when the vector p1p is perpendicular to n, where n is some vector that's perpendicular to the plane.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.340
So that's called a normal vector.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:10:00.080
Not that the others are abnormal, but okay.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.720
So how do we rephrase this condition?

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:13.220
Well, we've learned how to detect whether two vectors are perpendicular to each other using dot product.

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:14.660
Okay.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.180
That's the first lecture.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.760
So these two vectors are perpendicular exactly when their dot product is zero.

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:24.280
Okay.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:43.500
And so now, concretely, well, if we have a point p1 given to us and say we have been able to compute the vector n, then when we actually compute what happens, here we will have the coordinates x, y, z of a point p, and we'll get some condition on x, y, z.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.240
That will be the equation of the plane again.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:48.580
Okay. Now, why are these things the same?

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:53.720
Well, if I can tell you that, I should tell you how can we find a normal vector?

00:10:54.720 --> 00:11:02.640
But maybe you are already starting to see what the method should be, because we know how to find vectors perpendicular to two given vectors.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:04.420
All right.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:08.760
So we know two vectors in that plane, for example, p1p2 and p1p3.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.300
Actually, I could have used, you know, another permutation of a point.

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:13.620
But let's use these.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:21.240
So if I want to find a vector that's perpendicular to both p1p2 and p1p3 at the same time, all I have to do is take the cross product.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.200
So how do we find this vector that's perpendicular to the plane?

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:41.780
Well, the answer is we can just take the cross product, p1p2, cross p1p3.

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:52.980
I should say, well, you know, say that actually you took the point in a different order, you did p1p3 cross p1p2, you would get, of course, the opposite vector.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:57.780
But it's fine. Any plane has actually infinitely many normal vectors.

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:01.220
You can just, you know, multiply the normal vector by any constant.

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:02.960
You will still get a normal vector.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:04.840
That's absolutely fine.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:16.920
So that's going to be one of the main uses of that product, C, when we know two vectors in a plane, it lets us find the normal vector to the plane.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.400
And that is what we need to find the equation.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.180
Now, why is that the same as the answer over there?

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:37.660
Well, the condition that we have is that p1p.n should be zero.

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:46.240
And we say n is actually p1p2 cross p1p3.

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.760
So this is what we want to be zero.

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:59.680
Now, if you remember stuff from a long time ago, I mean, that was Friday, then we've introduced this thing and called it the triple product.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:09.020
And what we've seen is that the triple product is the same thing as the determinant.

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:19.080
So in fact, these two ways of thinking, one saying that the box formed by these three vectors should be flat and have volume zero.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:32.180
And the other one saying that we can find a normal vector and then express the condition that a vector is in the plane if it's perpendicular to the normal vector, they're actually giving us the same formula in the end.

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:45.100
Okay. Any quick questions before we move on?

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:46.720
Yes.

00:13:52.820 --> 00:14:01.980
So these two quantities, p1p.cross product of the determinant of the three vectors, they're always equal to each other.

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:10.360
Okay. They're always the same. And now, if the point is not in the plane, then the numerical value will be non-zero. If p isn't the plane, it will be zero.

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:20.940
Okay. Let's move on and talk a bit about matrices.

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:39.060
So, probably some of you have seen about matrices a little bit in high school, but certainly not all of you.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:47.480
And so anyway, let me just introduce you to a little bit about matrices just enough for what we'll need later in this class.

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:53.520
I should say if you want to know everything about the secret life of matrices, when you should take 1806 someday.

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:59.960
So, okay. So what's going to be our motivation for matrices?

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:11.540
Well, in life, a lot of things are related by linear formulas. And even if they are not, maybe sometimes you can approximate them by linear formulas.

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:24.080
So, often we have linear relations between variables.

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:37.160
And for example, well, if we do a change of coordinate systems.

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:52.000
So, for example, say that we're in space.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:16:02.400
Well, and we have a point. So, it's coordinates might be, let me call them x1, x2, x3 in my initial coordinate system.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:10.160
But then maybe I need to actually switch to different coordinates to better solve my problem, because it's more adapted to other things I will do in my problem.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:19.160
And so I have other coordinate axes. And then in these new coordinates, well, it will have actually different coordinates.

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:28.400
Let me call them say u1, u2, u3. And then the relation between the old and the new coordinates is going to be by linear formulas.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:38.440
I mean, especially if I choose the same origin. Otherwise, there might be constant terms, which I will not insist on.

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:42.720
So, let me just give an example.

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:59.660
For example, maybe, I don't know. Let's say, for example, u1 could be twice x1 plus three times x2 plus three times x3.

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:13.840
U2 might be two times x1 plus four times x2 plus five times x3. U3 might be x1 plus x2 plus two times x3.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:19.980
Do not ask me where these numbers come from. I just made them up. That's just an example of what might happen.

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:25.480
So put here your favorite numbers if you want.

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:37.220
Okay. So, now, in order to express this kind of linear relation, we can use matrices.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:48.220
So a matrix is just a table with numbers in it. And so we can reformulate this in terms of matrix multiplication.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.560
Or matrix product.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:18:11.240
Okay. So, instead of writing this, I will write that the matrix 2, 3, 3, 2, 4, 5, 1, 1, 2, times the vector,

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:20.040
x1, x2, x3 is equal to u1, u2, u3.

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:25.940
Okay. So, hopefully you see that there's the same information content on both sides.

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:31.640
I just need to explain to you what this way of multiplying tables of numbers means.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:39.240
Well, what it means is really that we'll take exactly these quantities.

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:46.980
Let me just say that more symbolically. So maybe this matrix we could call a.

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:53.740
And this we could call x. And this we could call capital U.

00:18:55.100 --> 00:19:00.000
Then we'll say a times x equals u, which is a lot shorter than that.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:06.820
Of course, I need to tell you what a x and u are in terms of their entries for you to get reformula.

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.160
But it's convenient notation.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:15.240
So, what does it mean to do a matrix product?

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:31.560
So, the entries in product, so I should say in the matrix product, are obtained by doing the dot product.

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:36.180
So, let's say we're doing the product a x.

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:53.340
So, we do a dot product between the rows, dot products, between the rows of a and the columns of x.

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:02.700
So, maybe I should say here, a is a free by free matrix.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:09.260
That just means there's, you know, free rows and free columns.

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:19.940
And x is the column vector, which we can think of as a free by one matrix.

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:23.020
It has free rows and only one column.

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:32.460
So, now what can we do? Well, I said we're going to do the dot product between a row of a, two, three, three.

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.220
And the column of x, x, one, x, two, x, three.

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:41.920
Well, that dot product will be two times x, one plus three times x, two plus three times x, three.

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:45.840
It's exactly what we want to set u, one equal to.

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:55.220
Let's do the second one. I take the second row of a, two, four, five, and I do the dot product with x, one, x, two, x, three.

00:20:55.720 --> 00:21:03.280
I will get two times x, one plus four times x, two plus five times x, three, which is this thing.

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:09.660
And same with the third one, one times x, one plus one times x, two plus two times x, three.

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.800
Okay, so that's matrix multiplication.

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:22.020
So, again, let me maybe restate that more generally.

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:34.900
So, if I want to find the entries of a product of two matrices, a and b,

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:42.600
so I'm saying matrices, but they could be, of course, vectors are now a special case of matrices, just by taking a matrix of width one.

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:51.240
Okay, so, if I have my matrix a, and I have my matrix b,

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:59.840
and then I will get the product a, b.

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:04.660
Well, let's say, for example, that a, you know, this works in any sizes.

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:10.620
So, let's say that a is a, sorry, a free by four matrix.

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.100
So, it has three rows, four columns.

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:17.040
And here I'm not going to give you the values because I'm not going to compute everything.

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:19.280
It would take, you know, for rest of the lecture.

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:23.420
So, and let's say that b is maybe size four by two.

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:28.520
So, it has two columns and four rows.

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:33.120
And let's say, for example, that we have the second column is 0, 3, 0, 2.

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:44.120
So, a times b, I claim, will have, well, the entries should be the dot products between these rows and these columns.

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.860
Here we have two columns, here we have three rows.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.560
So, we should get, you know, three times two different possibilities.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:54.640
And so, the answer will have size three by two.

00:22:56.580 --> 00:23:00.860
Okay? And, well, we cannot compute most of them because I didn't give you numbers.

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.580
But one of them we can compute.

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:07.460
We can compute the one that goes here, namely this one, in the second column.

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:12.480
So, I select the second column of b, and in the first row, so I take the first row of a,

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:20.360
and I find, well, one times zero, zero, two times three, six, plus zero, plus eight, should make 14.

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:22.920
So, this entry here is 14.

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:34.160
Okay? So, in fact, let me tell you about another way to set it up so that you remember more easily how, you know, what goes where.

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:41.180
So, one way that you can set it up is you can put a here.

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:47.200
You can put b up here, and then you will get the answer here.

00:23:50.440 --> 00:24:00.580
And, if you want to find what goes in a given slot here, then you just look to its left, and you look above it, and you do the dot product between these guys.

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:09.680
Okay? So, that's, I think, an easy way to remember, you know, first of all, it tells you what the size of the answer will be.

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:14.980
The size will be, well, what fits nicely in this box should have the same width as b, and the same height as a.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:19.540
And, second, it tells you which dot product to compute for each position.

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:25.920
Okay? So, you just look at what's to the left, and what's above the given position.

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:32.540
Now, there's a catch. Can we multiply anything by anything? Well, no.

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:42.600
Okay, I mean, I wouldn't ask the question of otherwise, but anyway, see, to be able to do this dot product, we need to have the same number of entries here and here.

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:48.980
Otherwise, we can't say take this times, that plus this times, that, and so on, if we run out of space on one of them before the other.

00:24:53.160 --> 00:25:09.920
So, the condition, and it's kind of important, so let me write it in the head, is that the width of a must equal the height of b.

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:22.680
Okay, so it's a bit cluttered, but hopefully you can still see what I think.

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:31.280
So, okay. But now we know how to multiply matrices.

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:50.660
So, what does it mean to multiply matrices? I mean, of course, we've seen, you know, on this example, that we can use the matrix to tell us how to transform from x's to use.

00:25:52.060 --> 00:26:00.340
And that's an example of multiplication. But now, let's say that we have two matrices like that, telling us how to transform from something to something else.

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:02.480
So, what does it mean to multiply them?

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:28.900
So, I claim that, so I claim that the product a, b represents doing first the transformation b, then transformation a.

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:39.500
So, that's a slightly counterintuitive thing, because we're used to writing things from left to right.

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:47.040
Unfortunately, with matrices the way they're done, you multiply things from right to left.

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:55.580
But if you think about it, you know, when you write say you have two functions, f and g, you write f of g of x, 20 minutes you apply first g, then f.

00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:57.260
So, it works the same way as that.

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:14.240
Okay, so, why is this? Well, if I write a, b times x, where x is some vector that I want to transform, it's the same as a times bx.

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:22.580
Okay, so this property is called associativity, and it's a good property of well-behaved products, not of cross-product by the way.

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:32.540
So, matrix product is associative, that means we can actually think of a product a, b, x, and multiply them in whichever order we want.

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:34.700
We can start with bx, or we can start with a, b.

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:46.200
So, now, bx means we apply the transformation b to x, and then multiplying by a means we apply the transformation a.

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:52.720
So, we first apply b, then we apply a, but the same as applying a, b, all at once.

00:27:55.460 --> 00:28:07.940
Okay, so, another note of warning is that a, b, and b, a are not the same thing at all.

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:19.000
Well, I mean, you probably see that already from this interpretation, it's not the same thing to convert oranges to bananas, then to carrots or vice versa.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:38.600
So, on the other hand, well, I mean, actually even worse, this thing might not even be well-defined, because, you know, if the height of, sorry, the width of a equals the height of b, we can do this product.

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:46.720
But we don't necessarily, I mean, it's not clear that the width of b will equal the height of a, which is what we would need for that one.

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:55.880
Okay, so, you know, the size condition to be able to do the product might not make sense, actually. Maybe one of them doesn't even make sense.

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:58.760
Even if they both make sense, they are usually completely different things.

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:06.580
Okay, the next thing I need to tell you is something called the identity matrix.

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:16.300
Well, the identity matrix is the matrix that does nothing.

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:23.340
Okay, so what does it mean to the nothing? I don't mean the matrix zero. The matrix zero would take x and would always give you back zero.

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:24.900
That's not very interesting transformation.

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:38.520
What I mean is the guy that takes x and gives you x again. So, it satisfies, you know, property i, so it's called i, and it has a property that i x equals x for all x.

00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:44.260
So, it's the transformation from something to itself. It's the obvious transformation called the identity transformation.

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:47.440
So, how do we write that as a matrix?

00:29:48.980 --> 00:30:00.320
Well, so actually there's an identity for each size, you know, because, of course, depending on whether x has two entries or ten entries, the matrix i needs to have a different size.

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:12.800
So, for example, the identity matrix of size three by three has entries one, one, one on the diagonal and zeroes every well.

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:23.380
Okay, let's check. If we multiply this with a vector, well, maybe I should do that on a separate board.

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:31.280
But so, start thinking about it. What happens when I multiply this with a vector x?

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:10.960
Okay, so let's say I multiply the matrix i with a vector x1, x2, x3.

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:21.000
Well, what will be the first entry? It will be the dot product between 1, 0, 0, and x1, x2, x3. If you want this vector is i hat.

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:31.540
Okay, so if you do the dot product with i hat, you will get the x component. You will get the first component that will be x1, 1 times x1 plus 0, 0.

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:38.640
Similarly, here, if I do the dot product, I get 0 plus x2 plus 0, I get x2, and here I get x3.

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:45.920
Okay, it works. Same thing if I put here a matrix, I will get back the same matrix.

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:57.960
Now, of course, okay, so in general, the identity matrix in size n by n.

00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:05.200
So it's an n by n thing with ones on the diagonal and zeroes everywhere else.

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:11.600
Okay, you just put one at every diagonal position and zero elsewhere.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.540
And then you can see if you multiply that by your vector, you will get the same vector back.

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:26.460
Okay. Okay.

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:32.640
Okay. Let me give you another example of a matrix.

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:49.160
Let's say that in the plane, we look at the transformation that does rotation by 90 degrees.

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:55.280
Let's say counterclockwise.

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:11.760
So I claim that this is given by the matrix, 0, 1 minus 1, 0.

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:15.080
So let's try to see why that is the case.

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:29.200
Well, if I do R times i hat, so if I apply that to the first vector, i hat.

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:33.740
So that means, okay, i hat will be 1, 0.

00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:42.040
This product, well, here you will get 0 and then you will get 1, you get j hat.

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:51.300
Okay. So this thing sends i hat to j hat.

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:53.680
What about j hat?

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:07.660
Well, you get negative 1 and then you get 0.

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:09.880
So that's minus i hat.

00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:13.000
So j is sent towards here.

00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:19.140
And in general, if you apply it to a vector with coordinates x, y, with components x, y,

00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:26.360
then you will get back minus yx, which is the formula we've seen for rotating a vector by 90 degrees.

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.040
So it seems to do what we want.

00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:48.180
By the way, I should point out, so the columns in this matrix represent what happens to each basis vector,

00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:50.860
to the vectors i and j. See?

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:56.340
I mean, this guy here is exactly what we get when we multiply R by i.

00:34:57.020 --> 00:35:00.260
And when we multiply R by j, we get this guy here.

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:07.520
So what's interesting about this matrix?

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:14.640
Well, we can do computations with matrices in ways that are easier than writing coordinate change formulas.

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:20.640
For example, if you compute R squared, so if you multiply R with itself,

00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:29.480
well, I let you do it as an exercise, but you will find that you get minus 1, 1, 0, 0.

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:31.820
So that's minus the identity matrix.

00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:34.700
Why is that?

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:41.820
Well, if I rotate something by 90 degrees, and then I rotate by 90 degrees again, then I will rotate by your 180 degrees.

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:45.680
That means I will actually just go to the opposite point around the origin.

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:49.800
So I will take xy to minus x minus y.

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:56.560
And if I applied R four times, R to the four would be identity.

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:05.260
Okay. Questions? Yes?

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:12.640
When you came up for R equals that matrix, is that the definition of R or is that just...

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:14.380
Ah, that's a very good question.

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:16.120
So how did I come up with this R?

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:24.180
Well, secretly, I worked pretty hard to find what are the entries that would tell me how to rotate something by 90 degrees counterclockwise.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:32.200
So remember, I mean, I should have said, what we saw, I think, last time, or the first lecture,

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:43.060
is that to rotate a vector by 90 degrees, we should change xy to minus yx.

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:49.340
Okay. And so now I'm trying to express this transformation as a matrix.

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:52.480
And if you work out, you know, how these guys...

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:54.240
So maybe you want to call these guys u and v.

00:36:54.840 --> 00:37:00.120
And if you write u equals 0x minus 1y, 0x minus 1y.

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:05.460
And then v equals 1x plus 0y, 1x plus 0y.

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:07.440
Okay. So that's how I would find it.

00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:11.480
Here, actually, I just gave it to you, you know, ready made.

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:13.900
So you didn't really see how I found it.

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:22.500
You will see more about rotations on the problem set.

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:26.120
There's... So you're going to see more about these things.

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:34.100
Okay. So next, I need to tell you how to invert matrices.

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:38.540
So what's the point of matrices?

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:41.620
It's that it gives us a nice way to think about these changes of variables.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.360
And in particular, if we know how to express u in terms of x,

00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:49.780
maybe we'd like to know how to express x in terms of u.

00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:54.740
Well, we can do that because we've learned how to solve linear systems like this.

00:37:55.760 --> 00:38:05.620
Okay. So in principle, we could start working substituting and so on to find formulas for the x1, x2, x3 as functions of u1, u2, u3.

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:09.980
And the relation will be again a linear relation.

00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:12.000
It will again be given by a matrix.

00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:15.680
Well, what's that matrix? It's the inverse transformation.

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:18.320
So it's the inverse of a matrix A.

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:24.660
So we're going to learn how to find the inverse of a matrix directly.

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:32.940
Okay.

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:54.640
So the inverse of a by definition is a matrix M with a property of a matrix.

00:38:56.220 --> 00:39:02.660
So that means that if I multiply A by M, then I get identity.

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:06.560
And if I multiply M by A, I also get identity.

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:08.760
If the two properties are equivalent.

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:14.560
So that means if I apply first the transformation A, then the transformation M,

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:17.400
I actually undo the transformation A and vice versa.

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:21.300
These two transformations are the opposite of each other.

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:23.860
Well, I should say the inverse of each other.

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:34.560
Okay. So for this to make sense, we need A must be a square matrix.

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:44.300
Okay. So it must have size n by n can be any size, but it must be the same number of rows as columns.

00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:51.080
And it's a general fact that, I mean, you will see more in detail in linear algebra.

00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:53.020
If you take it.

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:56.520
So let's just admit that.

00:39:58.020 --> 00:39:58.300
So.

00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:07.460
So the matrix M, we will denote by a inverse like this.

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:12.700
Okay. And then what is it good for?

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:18.060
Well, for example, the solution to a linear system.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.140
So what's a linear system in our new language?

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:26.740
It's a matrix times some unknown vector x equals some known vector B.

00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:29.560
Well, how do we solve that?

00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:36.480
Well, let's just compute x equals A inverse B.

00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:38.140
Why does that work?

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:41.040
How do I get from here to here?

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:42.860
Let's be careful.

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:54.720
Okay. Well, I'm going to reuse this matrix, but I'm going to erase it nonetheless.

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:57.080
And just rewrite it.

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:03.080
Let's.

00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:19.260
So.

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:24.680
I'm saying if ax equals B.

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:29.940
Then let's multiply both sides by a inverse.

00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:34.140
A inverse times ax is a inverse B.

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:38.320
And then well, a inverse times a is identity.

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:42.600
So I get x equals a inverse B.

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:45.640
That's how I solved my system of equations.

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:49.200
So if you have a calculator that can invert matrices,

00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:51.300
then you can solve linear systems very quickly.

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:55.860
Now, we should still learn how to compute these things.

00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:56.800
Yes?

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:05.560
How do I know that A inverse will be on the left of B and not after it?

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:08.400
Well, it's exactly in this derivation.

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:11.340
So if you're ever not sure, then just reproduce this calculation.

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:17.540
See, I mean, to get from here to here, what I did is I multiplied things on the left by a inverse.

00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:19.680
And then this guy simplify.

00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:23.980
If I had put a inverse on the right, I would have ax a inverse,

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:26.020
which might not make sense.

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:28.220
And even if it makes sense, it doesn't simplify.

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:29.680
So.

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:34.080
And the basic rule is, you know, you have to multiply it by a inverse on the left,

00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:36.280
so that it can solve with this a that's on the left.

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:40.980
That's correct.

00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:45.740
So, and, you know, in our usual way of dealing with matrices,

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:49.420
where the vectors are column vectors, I mean,

00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:53.480
it's just something to remember that if you have a square matrix times a column vector,

00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:57.680
I mean, the product that makes sense is with a matrix on the left, the vector on the right.

00:42:58.320 --> 00:42:59.500
The other one just doesn't work.

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:00.660
It's not sized.

00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:05.300
You cannot take x times a if a and x.

00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:10.760
You know, if a is a square matrix and x is a column vector,

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:12.460
this product makes sense.

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:14.220
The other one doesn't make sense.

00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:15.380
It's not the right size.

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:18.960
Okay.

00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:25.360
So, what we need to do is to learn how to invert a matrix.

00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:29.100
And it's useful to know first for your general knowledge and second,

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:35.280
because actually it's actually useful later for the rest of the class.

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:36.720
Things we'll see in this class.

00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:41.760
So, in particular, on the exam, you will need to know how to invert a matrix by hand.

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:48.360
So, I should say this formula is actually good for small matrices, you know,

00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:49.880
three by three, four by four.

00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:54.220
It's not good at all if you have a matrix of size of 1,000 by 1,000.

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:58.300
So, in computer software, actually for small matrices, they do this.

00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:00.400
For larger matrices, they use over algorithms.

00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:05.960
But let's just see how we do it.

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:08.040
So, I'm going to do it.

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:11.000
Okay. So, first of all, I will give you a final answer.

00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:15.960
And of course, for that, I will need to explain what the answer means.

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:21.760
So, we'll have to compute something called the adjoint matrix.

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:23.500
And I will tell you how to do that.

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:26.400
And then we'll divide by the determinant of A.

00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:37.080
So, how do we get to the adjoint matrix?

00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:41.940
So, let's go for the steps on a three by three example.

00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:47.800
The steps are the same, no matter what the size is.

00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:49.660
But let's do three by three.

00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:54.380
So, let's say that I'm giving you the matrix A,

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:58.040
well, let's say it's the same as earlier, the one that I erased.

00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:04.360
So, that was the one relating our axis and our use.

00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:13.400
So, the first thing I want to do is find what's called the minus.

00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:20.260
So, what's a minor?

00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:23.920
Well, it's a slightly smaller determinant.

00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:26.340
We've already seen them without calling them that way.

00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:31.460
So, for example, the matrix of minors will have again the same size.

00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:33.840
Let's say we want this entry.

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:35.880
Then we just delete this column.

00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:39.940
And we are left with a 2 by 2 determinant.

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:46.580
So, here we'll put the determinant for 512,

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:50.000
which is 4 times 2, 8 minus 5, 3.

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:52.280
Let's do the next one.

00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:55.240
So, for this entry, I delete this row and this column.

00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:57.200
I'm left with 2512.

00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:01.880
The determinant will be 2 times 2 minus 5 is negative 1.

00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:05.400
Then minus 2.

00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:07.520
Then I get to the second row.

00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:08.600
So, I get to this entry.

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:13.200
To find the minor here, I will delete this row and this column.

00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:15.240
And I'm left with 3, 3, 1, 2.

00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:17.920
3 times 2 minus 3 is 3.

00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:23.260
And let me just cheat and give you the others.

00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:27.380
I think I've shown you that I can do them.

00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:33.080
So, let's just explain the last one again.

00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:34.280
The last one, this 2.

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:39.080
So, to find the minor here, I delete this column and this row.

00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:40.200
And I take this determinant.

00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:42.080
2 times 4 minus 2 times 3.

00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:46.180
So, it's the same kind of manipulation that we've seen

00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:50.600
when we've taken determinants and cross-products.

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:58.360
Step 2, we go to another matrix that's called cofactors.

00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:02.220
So, the cofactors are pretty much the same thing as the miners.

00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:04.760
Except the signs are slightly different.

00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:13.060
So, what we do is we flip signs according to a checker board.

00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:16.640
And that one.

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:22.980
So, you start with a plus in the upper left corner.

00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:25.840
And you alternate pluses and minuses.

00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:29.220
So, the rule is if there's a plus somewhere,

00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:32.280
then there's a minus next to it and below it.

00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:36.960
And then below a minus or to the right for minus, there's a plus.

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:39.900
So, that's what it looks inside free by free.

00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:44.280
So, what do I mean by that?

00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:49.100
Sorry, I don't mean, you know, make this positive, make this negative, and so on.

00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:49.840
That's not what I mean.

00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:55.640
What I mean is if there's a plus, that means, leave it alone.

00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:58.000
We don't do anything to it.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.280
If there's a minus, that means we flip the sign.

00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:17.020
So, here we get, well, free, then one minus two, minus three, one plus one.

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:19.960
The output plus is just two, emphasize.

00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:23.500
Free, minus four, and two.

00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:27.380
Okay? That step is pretty easy.

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:30.220
I mean, the only half step in terms of calculations is this one.

00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:33.460
Because you have to compute all of these two by two determinants.

00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:44.980
By the way, I mean, this minus sign here, see, it's actually very related to the way in which,

00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:48.680
when we do a cross product, we have a minus sign for the second entry.

00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:53.400
Okay, we are almost done.

00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:56.080
Third step is to transpose.

00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:00.980
So, what does it mean to transpose?

00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:06.560
It means you read the rows of your matrix, and you write that as columns, or vice versa.

00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:07.240
Okay?

00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:11.400
So, let me just say we switch rows and columns.

00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:15.640
So, what do we get?

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.820
Well, let's just read it horizontally and write it vertically.

00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:23.440
We read three, one minus two, three, one minus two.

00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:28.540
Then we read minus three, one, one, minus three, one, one.

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:33.520
Then three, minus four, two, three, minus four, two.

00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:37.140
Okay? That's pretty easy.

00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:39.960
And we're almost done.

00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:44.940
The last step, so what we get here is this is the adjoint matrix.

00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:51.960
So, the fourth and last step is to divide by the determinant of A.

00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:56.980
Okay?

00:49:57.740 --> 00:50:02.420
So, here we have to compute the determinant to three, three.

00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:05.280
So, let's say determinant of A, okay?

00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:07.120
Not the determinant of this guy.

00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:14.280
So, two, three, three, two, four, five, one, one, two.

00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:16.640
Well, I let you check my computation.

00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:19.260
I found that it's equal to three.

00:50:20.860 --> 00:50:21.180
Okay?

00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:27.940
So, the final answer is that A inverse is one third of the matrix we got there.

00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:30.420
Three, minus three, three.

00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:35.040
One, one, minus four, minus two, one, two.

00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:37.940
Okay?

00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:43.060
And now, so that tells us, remember A told us how to find the use in terms of the axis.

00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:46.480
This one tells us now how to find the axis in terms of the use.

00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:50.840
If you multiply U1, U2, U3 by this, you get back X1, X2, X3.

00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:56.740
It also tells you how to solve the linear system, A times X equals something.

00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:01.700
Okay, that's the end for today.
