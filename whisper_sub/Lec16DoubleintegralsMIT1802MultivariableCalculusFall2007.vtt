00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.760
So basically, for the last few weeks

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.320
we've been doing derivatives, now we're

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.140
going to do integrals.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.840
So more precisely, we're going to be talking about double integrals.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.780
So just to motivate the notion, let me just remind you that when you have a function of one variable,

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:20.220
say f of x, and if you take its integral from say a to b of f of x d x,

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:36.640
well, that corresponds to the area below the graph of f over the interval from a to b.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:49.280
So the picture is something like, have a, you have b, you have the graph of f,

00:01:52.460 --> 00:02:00.280
and then what the integral measures is the area of this region.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.200
And when we say the area of this region, of course, if f is positive, that's what happens,

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.980
if f is negative, then we count negatively the area below the x-axis.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.840
So now when you have a function of two variables, then you can try to do the same thing.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.940
Namely, you can plot its graph, its graph will be a surface in space,

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.680
and then we can try to look for the volume below the graph,

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.600
and that's what we will call the double integral of a function of a certain region.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:46.480
Okay, so let's say that we have a function of two variables x and y,

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:59.440
then we look at the volume that's below the graph z equals f of xy.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.360
Okay, so let's draw a picture for what this means.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.980
I have a function of x and y, I can draw its graph, the graph will be, you know,

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.100
the surface with equation z equals f of x and y.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.700
And while I have to decide where I will integrate the function,

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.140
so far that I will choose some region in the xy plane,

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.320
and I will integrate the function on that region.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.720
So it's over a region r in the xy plane.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:52.000
So I have this region r, and I look at the piece of the graph that is above this region,

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.440
and we'll try to compute the volume of this solid here.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.940
Okay, that's what the double integral will measure.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:13.640
So we'll call that the double integral of the region r of f of xy,

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.380
dA, and I will have to explain what the notation means.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.180
So dA here stands for a piece of area, a stands for area.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.280
And, well, it's a double integral, so that's why we have two integral signs,

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.120
and we'll have to indicate somehow the region of which we're integrating.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.720
Okay, we'll come up with more concrete notations when we see how to actually compute these things.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.660
But that's the basic definition.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.320
Okay, so actually, how do, well, I mean, that's not really much of a definition yet.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.500
How do we actually, you know, define this rigorously?

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.620
Well, remember of an integral in one variable,

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.480
you probably saw a definition where you take your integral from a to b,

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.940
and you cut it into little pieces.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.460
And then for each little piece, you take the value of a function,

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.840
and you multiply by the weight of a piece that gives you a rectangular slice,

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.160
and then you sum all of these rectangular slices together.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.580
So here we'll do the same thing.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:21.240
Okay, so, well, let me put a picture up and explain what it does.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.200
So we are going to cut our region into little pieces, say, little rectangles,

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.460
or actually anything we want.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.680
And then for each piece, with a small area, delta A,

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:41.180
we'll take the area, delta A, times the value of a function in there,

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.820
that will give us the volume of a small box that sits under the graph.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.800
And then we'll add all these boxes together,

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.220
but gives us an estimate of a volume.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.420
And then to get, actually, the integral, the integral will be defined as a limit,

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.720
as we subdivide into smaller and smaller boxes, and with some more and more pieces.

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.340
Okay?

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.500
So actually, what we do, oh, I still have a board here.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:21.900
So the actual definition involves getting R into small pieces

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:33.440
of area, let's call delta A, maybe delta A, i, the area of the I's piece.

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:41.640
And then, okay, so, maybe in the x, y plane, we have our region,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.520
and we'll cut it, maybe using some grid.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.540
Okay? And then we'll have each small piece, each small piece,

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:56.280
we'll have a real delta A, oh, maybe delta A, i,

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:02.540
and it will be at some point, let's call it x, i, y, i,

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:16.680
x, i, x, i, and then we'll consider the sum of all the pieces of f at that point,

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.700
x, i, y, i, times the area of a small piece.

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:28.080
So what that corresponds to in the three-dimensional picture is just I sum the volumes

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.300
of all of these little columns that set under the graph.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:43.920
Okay? And then, so what I do is actually I take the limit

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:56.340
as the size of the pieces tends to zero, so I have more and more smaller and smaller pieces.

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.920
And that gives me the double integral.

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.260
Okay, so that's not a very good sentence, but whatever.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:14.340
Okay, so that's the definition.

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.120
Of course, we'll have to see how to compute it.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.360
We don't actually compute it.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.700
You know, when you compute an integral in single-vival calculus,

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.240
you don't do that. You don't cut into little pieces and sum the pieces together.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.000
You've learned how to integrate functions using various formulas.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:33.780
And similarly here, we'll learn how to actually compute these things without doing that cutting into small pieces.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:38.680
Okay, any questions first about the concept or what the definition is?

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:39.000
Yes?

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.800
Well, so we'll have to learn which tricks work and how exactly.

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:58.040
But so what we'll do actually is we'll reduce the calculation of a double integral to two calculations of single integrals.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:02.580
And so for these, certainly all the tricks you've learned in single-vival calculus will come in handy.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:08.960
Okay, so yes, that's a strong signal by the way that if you've forgotten everything about single-vival calculus,

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:12.580
now might be a good time to actually brush up on integrals.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:21.860
You know, the usual integrals and the usual substitution tricks and easy trig in particular.

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.120
This will be very useful.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.880
Okay, so yes, so how do we compute these things?

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:32.060
That's what we have to come up with.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:41.520
And well, you know, going back to what we did with derivatives to understand variations of functions and derivatives,

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:45.340
what we did was really we took slices parallel to an excess or another one.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.380
So in fact, here the key is also the same.

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:54.080
So what we're going to do is instead of cutting into a lot of small boxes like that and something completely at random,

00:09:55.080 --> 00:10:00.340
we'll actually somehow scan our region, scan through our region by parallel planes.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:05.340
Okay, so let me put up actually a slightly different picture up here.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:13.840
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to take planes, say in this picture parallel to the waisy plane,

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:19.280
I'll take a moving plane that scans from the back to the front or from the front to the back.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:27.720
So that means, you know, I set a value of x0 of x and I look at the slice x equals x0.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.940
And then I will do that for all values of x0.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:36.660
So now in each slice, well, I get what looks a lot like a single variable integral.

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:43.700
Okay, and that integral will tell me what is the area in this, well, I guess it's supposed to be green,

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:47.920
but it all comes as black. So let's say the black shaded slice.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:55.340
And then when I add all of these areas together as the value of x changes, I will get the volume.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.940
Okay, let me try to explain that again.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:14.520
So to compute this integral, what we do is actually we take slices.

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:36.760
So let's consider, let's call s of x, the area of a slice, well, by a plane parallel to the waisy plane.

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:46.920
Okay, so on the picture, s of x is just the area of this thing in the vertical wall.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:53.500
Now, if you sum all of these, well, let's see, why does that work?

00:11:54.340 --> 00:12:00.880
So if you take the region between two parallel slices that are very close to each other, what's the volume between these two things?

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:12.980
Well, it's essentially s of x times the thickness of this very thin slice, and the thickness would be delta x or dx if you take a limit with more and more slices.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:24.720
Okay, so that the volume will be the integral of s of x dx.

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:30.400
From, well, what should be the range for x?

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:40.160
Well, we would have to start at the very lowest value of x that ever happens in our region, and we'd have to go all the way to the very largest value of x.

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.440
Okay, from the very far back to the very far front.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:54.060
So, on this picture, we'd probably start over here at the back, and with end over here at the front.

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:03.840
So let me just say from the minimum x to the maximum x.

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:24.220
And now, how do we find s of x? Well, s of x will be actually again an integral, but now it's an integral of a variable y, because when we look at this slice, what changes from left to right is y.

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.620
So, let me actually write that down.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:48.160
For a given x, the area s of x, you can compute as an integral of f of xy dy.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:54.700
Okay, well now x is a constant, and y will be the variable of integration.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:04.720
What's the range for y? Well, it's from the leftmost point here, to the rightmost point here, on the given slice.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:09.300
So, there's a big catch here. That's a very important thing to remember.

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:15.260
What is the range of integration for y? Depends actually on x.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:25.880
See, if I take this slice that's pictured on that diagram, then the range for y goes all the way from the very left to the very right.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:33.200
But if I take a slice that's, say, near the very front, then in fact, only a very small segment of it will be in my region.

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:40.020
So, the range of values for y will be much less. Let me actually draw a 2D picture for that.

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:48.560
So, remember, we fix x, and we vary, sorry, so we fix a value of x.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:58.820
Okay, and for a given value of x, what we'll do is we'll slice our graph by this plane parallel to the y-z plane.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.520
So, now we imagine the graph is sitting above that. And that's the region r.

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:10.700
I have the region r, and I have the graph of a function above this region r.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:20.160
And I'm trying to find the area between this segment and the graph above it in this vertical plane.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:31.700
Well, to do that, I have to integrate from y going from here to here.

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:36.700
I want the area of a piece that sits above this red segment.

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:43.240
And so, in particular, the end point, the extreme values for y depend on x.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:51.020
Because, see, if I slice here instead, well, my bounds for y will be smaller.

00:15:54.500 --> 00:16:06.600
Okay, so now if I put the two things together, what I will get is actually from you know,

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:19.980
where I have to integrate over x and integral over y.

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:41.980
Okay, and so this is called an iterated integral because we iterate twice the process of taking an integral.

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:57.620
Okay, so again, what's important to realize here?

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:04.280
I mean, I'm going to say that several times over the next few days, but that's because it's the single most important thing to remember about the whole integral.

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:08.080
The bounds here are just going to be numbers.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:17.400
Okay, because the question that I'm asking myself here is what is the first value of x by which I want to slice and what is the last value of x?

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:22.320
You know, which range of x do I want to look at to take my red slices?

00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:32.060
And the answer is I would go all the way from here, that's my first slice, to somewhere here, that's my last slice.

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:39.340
For any value in between these, I will have some red segment and I will want to integrate over that.

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:46.060
On the other hand, here, the bounds will depend on the outer variable x.

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:54.100
Because if I fix a value of x, what the values of y will be depends on x, in general.

00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:03.560
Okay, so I think probably we should do lots of examples to convince ourselves, you know, and see how it works.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:15.960
Yeah, it's called an iterative integral because first we integrate over y and then we integrate again over x.

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:16.740
Okay?

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:27.720
So we can do that well, I mean, y depends on x or x depends, no, actually x and y vary independently of each other inside here.

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:32.360
What is more complicated is how the bounds on y depend on x.

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:37.740
But actually you could also do it the other way around, first integrate over x and then over y.

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:41.200
And then the bounds for x would depend on y. We'll see that on an example.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:41.760
Yes?

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:47.500
For your y values, are you using the starting point?

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:50.540
We just use the highest possible range for y.

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:56.340
So for y, I'm using the range of values for y that corresponds to the given value of x.

00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:03.580
Okay? I mean, remember, this is just like a plot in the xy plane, above that we have the graph.

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:17.780
Maybe I should draw a picture here instead. For a given value of x, so that's a given slice, I have a range of values for y that is from, you know, the spectral is the leftmost point on that slice to the rightmost point on that slice.

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:22.480
So where I start and where I stop depends on the value of x.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:24.580
Does that make sense?

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:38.220
Okay. Okay. No more questions? No? Okay.

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:40.940
So let's do a first example.

00:19:47.500 --> 00:20:03.720
So let's say that we want to integrate the function 1 minus x square minus y squared over the region defined by x between 0 and 1 and y between 0 and 1.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:17.280
So what does that mean geometrically? Well, z equals 1 minus x square minus y squared, and it's a variation on, you know, something, I think actually we've plotted that one, right?

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:21.320
When we've, that was our first example of a function of two variables, possibly.

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:26.780
And so we saw that the graph is this paraboloid pointing downwards.

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:30.580
Okay. It's what you get by taking a parabola parabola and rotating it.

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:44.520
And now what we're asking is what is the volume between the paraboloid and the xy plane over the square of side 1 in the xy plane, x and y between 0 and 1.

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:55.640
Okay. So what we'll do is we'll, so see, here I've tried to represent the square and we'll just sum.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.120
The areas of the slices as say x varies from 0 to 1.

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:08.640
And here, of course, setting up the bounds will be easy because no matter what x I take, why still goes from 0 to 1.

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:15.660
See, it's easiest to do double integrals when the region is just a rectangle in the xy plane.

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:19.020
Because then you don't have to worry too much about what are the ranges.

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:39.300
Okay. So let's do it. Well, that would be the integral from 0 to 1 of the integral from 0 to 1 of 1 minus x square minus y squared, dy dx.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:46.500
Okay. So I'm dropping the parentheses. But if you still want to see them, I'm going to put them in, you know, very thin.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:52.580
So as you see what it means, but actually the convention is we won't put these parentheses in there anymore.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:22:02.860
Okay. So what this means is first I will integrate 1 minus x square minus y squared over y ranging from 0 to 1 with x health fixed.

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:15.340
So what that represents is the area in this slice. So see here, actually, I've drawn, well, what happens is actually the function takes positive and negative values.

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:22.200
So in fact, I will be counting positively this part of the area. And I will be counting negatively this part of the area.

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:38.880
I mean, as usual, when I do an integral. So what I will do to evaluate this, I will first do what's called the inner integral.

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.900
So to do the inner integral, well, it's pretty easy.

00:22:51.200 --> 00:23:02.440
How do I integrate this? Well, it becomes. So what's the integral of 1? It's y. Just the only thing to remember is we're integrating respect to y, not to x.

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:13.800
The integral of x squared is x squared times y. And the integral of y squared is y cubed over free.

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:28.760
Okay. And then we plug in the bounds, which are 0 and 1 in this case. And so when you plug y equals 1, you will get 1 minus x squared minus 1 third.

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:40.640
Well, from y equals 0, you get 0, 0, 0. So nothing changes. So you're left with 2 thirds minus x squared.

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:56.740
Okay. And that's a function of x only. Here, you shouldn't see any y's anymore because y was your integration variable. But you still have x. You still have x because the area of this shaded slice depends, of course, on the value of x.

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:07.280
And so now the second thing to do is to do the outer integral.

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:20.260
So now we integrate from 0 to 1, what we got, which is 2 thirds minus x squared, dx.

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:35.120
Okay. And we know how to compute that because that integrates to 2 thirds x minus 1 third x cubed between 0 and 1. And I let you do the computation. You will find it's 1 third.

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:40.300
Okay. So that's the final answer.

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:55.140
So that's the general pattern. See, when we have a double integral to compute, first we want to set it up carefully. We want to find what will be the bounds in x and y. And here that was actually pretty easy because our region was very simple.

00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:06.920
Then we want to compute the inner integral and then we compute the outer integral. And that's it. Okay. Any questions at this point?

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:24.960
Okay. So by the way, we started with a dA in the notation. Right. Here we had dA. And that somehow became a dy dx.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:45.060
Okay. So dA became dy dx because when we do the outer integral this way, what we're actually doing is that we are slicing our region into small rectangles.

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:57.260
Okay. Now what's the area of this small rectangle here? Well, it's the product of its weight times its height. So that's delta x times delta y.

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:02.040
Okay. So delta a equals delta x delta y became.

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:08.460
So actually it's not just becomes it's really equal.

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:19.020
For the small rectangles.

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:32.160
Now it became dy dx and not dx dy. Well, that's a question of in which order we do the iterative integral.

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:43.820
It's up to us to decide whether we want to integrate x first, then y or y first, then x. But as we'll see very soon, that is an important decision when it comes to setting up the bounds of integration.

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:50.900
Here it doesn't matter, but in general we have to be very careful about in which order we'll do things. Yes?

00:26:53.340 --> 00:27:06.200
Well, always works. Yeah, it's well, in principle it always works both ways. Sometimes it will be that you know because the region has a strange shape, you can actually set it up more easily one way than the other.

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:12.540
Sometimes it will also be that the function here, you actually know how to integrate in one way that not the other.

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:19.320
So the theory is that it should work both ways in practice one of the two calculations maybe much harder.

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:42.520
Let's do another example. Let's say that what I wanted to know was not actually what I computed, namely the volume below the part of the formula.

00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:04.780
So that means instead of integrating over the entire square of size one, I should just integrate over the quarter disk.

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:12.800
I should stop integrating where my paraboloid hits the xy plane. So let me draw another picture.

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:20.300
So let's say I wanted to integrate actually.

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:30.260
So let's call this example two.

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:42.980
So it's the same, we're going to do the same function, but over a different region. And the region will just be now this quarter disk here.

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:56.820
So maybe I should draw a picture in the xy plane. That's my new region now.

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:20.620
So in principle it will be the same integral, but what changes is the bounds. Why do the bounds change?

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:32.460
Well the bounds change because now if I set, if I fix some value of x, then I will want to integrate this part of the slice that's above the xy plane.

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:36.900
And I don't want to take this part that's actually outside of my disk.

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:54.820
So I should stop integrating over y when y reaches this value here. On that picture here, on this picture, if I fix value of x, the range of values for y should go only from here to here.

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:58.300
So that's from here to less than one.

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:12.700
So for given x, the range of y is well.

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:20.480
So what's the lowest value of y that I will want to look at? It's still zero. From y equals zero.

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:26.920
To what's the value of y here? Well I have to solve in the equation of a circle.

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:39.300
So if I'm here, this is x squared plus y squared equals one. That means y is square root of 1 minus x squared.

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:47.160
So I will integrate from y equals zero to y equals square root of 1 minus x squared.

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:52.220
And now you see how the bounds for y will depend on the value of x.

00:30:56.120 --> 00:31:00.080
So what I erase, I will let you think about what is the bound for x now.

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.220
It's a trick question.

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.180
Okay.

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:42.780
So I claim that what we'll do.

00:31:48.1000 --> 00:31:51.700
So we'll write this as an iterative integral.

00:31:53.900 --> 00:32:05.740
First dy than dx. And we said for a fixed value of x, the range for y is from zero to square root of 1 minus x squared.

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:13.900
What about the range for x? Well, the range for x should just be numbers.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:24.180
Remember the question I have to ask now is if I look at all of these yellow slices, which one is the first one that I want to consider, which one is the last one that I want to consider?

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:28.840
So the smallest value of x that I want to consider is zero again.

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:35.320
And then I will have there, I will actually have a pretty big slice, and I will get smaller and smaller and smaller slices.

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:40.620
And it stops, I have to stop when x equals 1. Afterwards, there's nothing else to integrate.

00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:45.360
So x goes from zero to 1.

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:56.180
Okay. And now see how in the inner integral of the bounds depend on x, in the outer one you just get numbers.

00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:03.080
Because the questions that you have to ask to set up this one and set up that one are different.

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:13.480
Here the question is if I fix a given x, if I look at a given slice, what's the range for y? Here the question is what's the first slice, what is the last slice?

00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:19.740
Does that make sense? Everyone happy with that?

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.020
Okay, very good.

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:26.300
So now how do we compute that?

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:41.440
Well, we do the inner integral, so that's integral from zero to square root of 1 minus x squared of 1 minus x squared minus y squared dy.

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:54.100
And well, that integrates to y minus x squared y minus y cubed over 3 from zero to square root of 1 minus x squared.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:15.600
And then that becomes, well, root of 1 minus x squared minus x squared root of 1 minus x squared minus y minus x squared to the three halves of a free.

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:22.160
Okay, and actually if you look at it for long enough, see this is 1 minus x squared times squared root of 1 minus x squared.

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:30.600
So actually that's also, so in fact that simplifies to 2 thirds of 1 minus x squared to the three halves.

00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:38.160
Okay, let me redo that maybe.

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:43.180
It's slightly differently. This was 1 minus x squared times y.

00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:55.860
So 1 minus x squared times y becomes square root of 1 minus x squared.

00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:57.160
Oops, x squared.

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.080
Minus y cubed over 3.

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:05.420
And then when I take y equals zero, I get zero, so I don't subtract anything.

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:10.980
Okay, so now you see this is 1 minus x squared to the three halves minus a third of it.

00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:12.000
So you're left with 2 thirds.

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:14.280
Okay.

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:19.600
So that's the inner integral.

00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:30.800
The outer integral is integral from zero to 1 of 2 thirds of 1 minus x squared to the free halves, the x.

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:45.560
And well, I let you see if you remember single variable integral also by trying to figure out how this actually comes out to be.

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:49.940
Is it pi over 2 or pi over 8 actually?

00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:54.500
I think it's pi over 8.

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:09.980
Okay, well, I guess we have to do it then.

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:15.440
I've got something on my notes, but it's not very clear.

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:18.140
Okay, so how do we compute this thing?

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:19.720
Well, we have to do trig substitution.

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:22.500
That's the only way I know to compute anything or like that.

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:27.520
Okay, so we'll set x equal sine theta.

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:35.300
And then square root of 1 minus x squared will be cosine theta.

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:39.080
We're using sine square plus cosine square equals 1.

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:46.700
And so that will become.

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:58.200
So 2 thirds remains 2 thirds.

00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:03.620
1 minus x squared to the free halves becomes cosine cubed theta.

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:11.440
Dx, well, sine, if x is sine theta then dx is cosine theta.

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:12.920
The theta.

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:15.720
So that's cosine theta, the theta.

00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:24.280
And well, if you do things, the solutions the way I do them, then you should worry about the bounds for theta, which will be 0 to pi over 2.

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:27.560
Or you can, you know, also just plug in the bounds at the end.

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:39.120
So now you have the 2 thirds times the integral from 0 to pi over 2 of cosine to the 4 theta d theta.

00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:42.500
And how do you integrate that?

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:44.880
Well, you have to use double angle formulas.

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:53.440
Okay, so cosine to the 4.

00:37:54.660 --> 00:38:03.400
Remember, cosine square theta is 1 plus cosine 2 theta over 2.

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:05.520
And we want the square of that.

00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:18.240
And so that will give us.

00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:23.600
Well, we'll have.

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:25.540
So actually.

00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:31.540
1 quarter plus 1 half cosine to theta.

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:34.580
Plus 1 quarter cosine square to theta.

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.240
D theta.

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:43.460
And how will you handle this guy while using a gain for the whole angle formula?

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:47.260
Okay, so it's getting slightly nasty.

00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:58.360
So, but I don't know any simpler solution except for one simpler solution, which is you have a table of integrals of this form inside the nodes.

00:38:59.120 --> 00:38:59.420
Yes?

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:11.480
No, I don't think so because if you take 1 half times cosine half times 2, you will still have a half.

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:20.340
Okay, so if you do again for the whole angle formula, I think I'm not going to bother to do it.

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:29.620
I claim you will get at the end pi over 8 because I say so.

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:45.040
So, okay, so exercise.

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:48.300
Continue calculating and get pi over 8.

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:55.740
Okay, now what does this show us?

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:59.360
Well, this shows us actually that this is probably not the right way to do this.

00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:02.240
Okay, the right way to do this will be to integrate it in polar coordinates.

00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:04.080
And that's what we'll learn how to do tomorrow.

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:05.700
Okay.

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:11.480
So, we'll actually see how to do it with much less trig.

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:39.520
So, that will be easier in polar coordinates.

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:46.680
So, we'll see that tomorrow.

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:50.860
Okay, so, but you know, we are almost there.

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:55.020
I mean, here you just use the double angle again and then you can get it and it's, it's pretty straightforward.

00:40:56.680 --> 00:41:04.520
Okay, so one thing that's kind of interesting to know is we can exchange the order of integration.

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:13.840
So, if we have an integral given to us in the order dy dx, we can switch it to dx dy.

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:17.060
But we have to be extremely careful with the bounds.

00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:30.380
So, you certainly cannot just swap the bounds of the inner and outer because there you would end up, you know, having this square root of 1 minus x square on the outside and you would never get a number out of it.

00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:33.040
So, that cannot work.

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:34.420
It's more complicated than that.

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:39.200
Okay, so, well, here's a first baby example.

00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:52.320
Certainly, if I do integral from 0 to 1 integral from 0 to 2 dx dy, I can, there I can certainly switch the bounds without thinking too much.

00:41:52.320 --> 00:42:03.960
What's the reason for that? Well, the reason for that is, you know, this corresponds in both cases to integrating x from 0 to 2 and y from 0 to 1.

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:05.300
It's a rectangle.

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:12.920
So, if I slice it this way, you see that y goes from 0 to 1 for any x between 0 and 2. It's this guy.

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:23.460
If I slice it that way, then x goes from 0 to 2 for any value of y between 0 and 1 and it's this one.

00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:30.260
So, here it works. But in general, I have to draw a picture of my region and see how the slices look like both ways.

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:36.240
Okay, so, let's do a more interesting one.

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:53.080
Let's say that I want to compute integral from 0 to 1 of integral from x to square root of x of e to the y of y and dy dx.

00:42:55.360 --> 00:43:02.060
So, why did I choose this guy? I chose this guy because, as far as I can tell, there's no way to integrate e to the y of y.

00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:06.800
So, this is integral, but you cannot compute this way.

00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:10.440
So, it's a good example for y. This can be useful.

00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:15.700
So, if you do it this way, you're stuck immediately. So, instead, we'll try to switch the order.

00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:20.300
But to switch the order, we have to understand what do these bounds mean?

00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:24.740
Okay, so, let's draw a picture of the region.

00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:32.460
Well, what we're saying is y goes from y equals x to y equals square root of x.

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:40.320
Well, let's draw y equals x and y equals square root of x.

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:54.220
Well, maybe I should actually put this here, y equals x to y equals square root of x.

00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:58.780
Okay, and so, I will go for each value of x.

00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:05.580
I will go from y equals x to y equals square root of x.

00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:12.580
And I will do that for values of x that go from x equals zero to x equals one,

00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:16.540
which happens to be exactly where these things intersect.

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:21.780
So, my region will consist of all this.

00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:26.420
Okay? So, now, if I want to do it the other way around,

00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:28.320
I have to decompose my region.

00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:34.660
The other way around, I have to, so, my goal now is to provide this as an integral.

00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:36.240
Well, it's still the same function.

00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:38.200
It's still e to the y over y.

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:40.620
But now, I want to integrate dx dy.

00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:44.720
So, how do I integrate over x?

00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:46.860
Well, I fix a value of y.

00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:50.920
And for that value of y, what's the range for x?

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:53.640
Well, the range for x is from here to here.

00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:57.580
Okay, what's the value of x here?

00:44:57.740 --> 00:44:58.600
Let's start with the easy one.

00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:01.780
This is x equals y.

00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:03.220
What about this one?

00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:06.240
It's x equals y squared.

00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:13.440
Okay? So, x goes from y squared to y.

00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:15.500
And then what about y?

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:18.980
Well, I have to start at the bottom of my region.

00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:23.320
That's y equals zero to the top, which is at y equals one.

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:26.540
So, y goes from zero to one.

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:32.080
So, see, switching the bounds is not completely obvious.

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:34.580
That took a little bit of work.

00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:40.980
But now that we've done that, well, just to see how it goes,

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:43.640
it's actually going to be much easier to integrate,

00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:50.260
because in our integral, well, what's the integral of e to the y over y

00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:51.240
with respect to x?

00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:53.560
It's just that times x, right?

00:45:57.940 --> 00:46:00.420
From x equals y squared to y.

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:03.780
So, that will be, well, if I plug x equals y,

00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:09.260
I will get e to the y minus, if I plug x equals y squared,

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:11.460
I will get e to the y over y times y squared.

00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:14.500
e to the y times y.

00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:16.580
Okay?

00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:19.040
So, now, if I do the outer integral,

00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:29.720
I will have the integral from zero to one of e to the y minus y e to the y d y.

00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:33.240
And that one actually is a little bit easier.

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:38.060
So, we know how to integrate e to the y.

00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:40.320
We don't quite know how to integrate y e to the y.

00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:40.960
But let's try.

00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:43.420
So, let's see.

00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:47.380
What's the derivative of y e to the y?

00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:58.760
Well, by the product rule, that's one times e to the y plus y times the derivative of e to the y is y e to the y.

00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:02.680
So, if we do, let's put a minus sign in front.

00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:08.800
Well, that's almost what we want, except we have a minus e to the y instead of a plus e to the y.

00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:11.240
So, we need to add two e to the y.

00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:14.840
And I claim that's the anti-derivative.

00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:23.280
Okay? If you got lost, you can also do it by integrating by parts, by taking the derivative of y and integrating this guy.

00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:27.440
Or, but you know, that works.

00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:34.640
Just, you know, your first guess would be, maybe let's try minus y e to the y, take the derivative of that compare, see what you need to do to fix.

00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:40.360
So, if you take that between 0 and 1, you will eventually get e minus 2.

00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:46.380
Okay.

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:55.420
So, tomorrow we are going to see how to do double integrals in polar coordinates and also applications of double integrals.

00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:57.400
How to use them for interesting things.
