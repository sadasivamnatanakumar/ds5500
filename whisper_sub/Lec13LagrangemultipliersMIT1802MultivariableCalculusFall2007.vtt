00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.560
So last time we saw things about gradients

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.860
and directional derivatives before that

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.320
we've studied how to look for minima and maxima functions

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.700
of several variables.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.760
And today we're going to look again at min max problems,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.760
but in a different setting, namely,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.720
when the variables are not independent.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.380
And so what we'll see is the method of Lagrange multipliers.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.560
And this is the one point in the term

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.480
when I can shine with my French accent

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.100
and say Lagrange name properly.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.160
OK, so what are Lagrange multipliers about?

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.760
Well, the goal is to minimize or maximize a function

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.140
of several variables.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.380
Let's say, for example, f of x, y, z, three variables.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.760
But where these variables are no longer independent.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.960
So they're not independent.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.460
That means that there's a relation between them.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.680
The relation is maybe some equation

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.180
of the form g of x, y, z equals some constant.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.360
So you take the relation between x, y, z,

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.940
you call that g, and that gives you the constraint.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.300
And the goal is to minimize f only of those values

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.200
of x, y, z that satisfy the constraint.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.460
So what's one way to do that?

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.060
Well, one way to do that, if the constraint is very simple,

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.620
we can maybe solve for one of the variables.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.900
Maybe we can solve this equation for one of the variables

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.540
plugged back into f.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.300
And then we have a usual min max problem

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.420
that we've seen how to do.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.600
The problem is sometimes you can't actually

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.980
solve for x, y, z in here because this condition is too

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:31.480
complicated.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.160
And then we need a new method.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.260
And that's what we are going to do.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.520
OK?

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.360
So why would we care about that?

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.800
Well, one example is actually in physics.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.480
Maybe you've seen in thermodynamics

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.260
that you study quantities about guesses.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.060
And those quantities that involve pressure, volume,

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.840
and temperature.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.720
And pressure, volume, and temperature

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.320
are not independent of each other.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.580
I mean, you know probably the equation pv equals nRt.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.800
And of course, there you could actually

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.300
solve to express things in terms of one or the other.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.200
But sometimes it's more convenient to really keep all

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.640
free variables, but treat them as constraint.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.240
So it's just an example of a situation

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.380
where you might want to do this.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.260
Anyway, we look mostly at mathematical examples,

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.960
but just to point out that this is useful when you study

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.700
guesses in physics.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.140
So the first observation is we can't

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.980
use our usual method of looking for radical points of f.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.040
Because critical points of f, typically,

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.680
they will not satisfy this condition.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.360
So they won't be good solutions.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.580
We need something else.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.600
OK?

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.700
So well, let's look at an example.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.900
And we'll see how that leads us to the method.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.420
OK, so for example, let's say that I want to find the point

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:10.080
closest to the origin on the hyperbola.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.820
x, y equals free in the plane.

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.000
So that means I have this hyperbola,

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.880
and I'm asking myself, what's the point on it that's

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.540
the closest to the origin?

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.820
I mean, we can solve this by elementary geometry.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.260
We don't need actually large multipliers,

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.640
but we are going to do it with large multipliers,

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.500
because it's a pretty good example.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.000
So what does it mean?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.200
Well, it means really we want to minimize distance

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.980
to the origin.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.420
So what's the distance to the origin?

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.440
If I have a point that coordinates x, y,

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.800
then the distance to the origin is square root of x,

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:59.720
square plus y squared.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.780
Well, do we really want to minimize that?

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.140
Or can we minimize something easier?

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.760
Yeah, maybe we can minimize the square of a distance.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.460
So let's forget this guy.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:25.740
And instead, so actually, we'll minimize f of x, y equals x

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.800
squared plus y squared, but looks better.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:39.300
Subject to the constraint, x, y equals 3.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.700
And so we'll call this feng g of x, y,

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.000
to illustrate the general method.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.200
So let's look at a picture.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:00.040
So here you can see, in yellow, the hyperbola x, y equals 3.

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.500
And we're going to look for the points that are closest

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.120
to the origin.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.380
So what can we do?

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.040
Well, for example, we can plot the function x squared plus

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.300
y squared function f.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.660
That's the contour plot of f with a hyperbola on top of it.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.860
And now let's see what we can do with it.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.460
Well, let's ask ourselves, for example,

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.740
if I look at points that are where f equals 20 now,

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.620
I think I'm at 20, but you can't really see it.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.120
That's a circle.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.700
That's a point where distance squared is 20.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.800
Well, can I find a solution if I'm on the hyperbola?

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.260
Yes, there are four points at this distance.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.860
Can I do better?

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.700
Well, let's decrease the distance.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.480
Yes, we can still find points in the hyperbola.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:51.860
And so on.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.680
Well, except if we go too low, then there's

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.760
no points on this circle anymore on the hyperbola.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.320
So if we decrease the value of f that we want to look at,

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.820
there's somehow a limit value beyond which we can't go.

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:04.880
And that's the minimum of f.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.820
So we're trying to look for the smallest value of f

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.680
that will actually be realized on the hyperbola.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.340
So when does that happen?

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.980
Well, I have to backtrack a little bit.

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.800
It seems like the limiting case is basically here.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.540
It's when the circle is tangent to the hyperbola.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.020
That's the smallest circle that will hit the hyperbola.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.780
So if I take a larger value of f, I will have solutions.

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.100
If I take a smaller value of f,

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.740
I will not have any solutions anymore.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.980
So that's the situation that we want to solve for.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.100
So how do we find that minimum?

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:55.720
Well, the key observation that's valid on this picture,

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.060
and that actually will remain true in the completely general

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.820
case is that when we're at the minimum,

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.940
the level curve of f is actually tangent

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.260
to our hyperbola.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.940
It's tangent to our constraint,

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:17.060
I mean, to the set of points where x, y equals free,

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:17.780
to the hyperbola.

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:21.520
So let's write that down.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:25.760
Observe, we observe that at the minimum,

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:32.960
the level curve

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:46.020
of f is tangent to the hyperbola.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.180
And remember, the hyperbola is given by the equation g

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.100
equals free, so it's a level curve of g.

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.080
So we have a level curve of f and a level curve of g

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.300
that are tangent to each other.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.820
And I claim that's going to be the general situation

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.080
that we're interested in.

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.080
So how do we look for, you know, try to solve

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.500
for points where this happens?

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.220
So how do we find x, y, where the level curves of f and g

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:31.980
are tangent?

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.420
To each other.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.820
Well, so let's think for a second.

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:49.860
If the two level curves are tangent to each other,

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.620
that means that we have the same tangent line, right?

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.160
If we have the same tangent line,

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.520
that means that the normal vectors should be parallel.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.740
Let me maybe draw a picture here.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:06.340
So this is the level curve, maybe, f equals something.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:13.460
And this is the level curve g equals constant.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:14.760
Here my constant is free.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.200
Well, if I look at the gradient vectors,

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:21.480
so the gradient of f will be perpendicular

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.760
to the level curve of f.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.320
The gradient of g will be perpendicular

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.020
to the level curve of g.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.180
They don't have any reason to be of the same size, okay?

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:31.900
But they have to be parallel to each other.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.600
Of course, they could also be parallel pointing

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.620
in opposite directions.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:36.840
Let me know.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:45.540
But the key point is that when this happens,

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:51.420
the gradient of f is parallel to the gradient of g.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.200
Well, let's check that.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:02.240
Okay, so here's a point.

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:05.500
And I can plot the gradient of f in blue,

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.240
the gradient of g in yellow.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.460
And you see in most of these places,

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:13.420
somehow the two gradients are not really parallel.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.460
Actually, I shouldn't be looking at random points.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.620
I should be looking only on the hyperbola, right?

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.480
I want points on the hyperbola,

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.180
where the two gradients are parallel.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:23.240
Well, when does that happen?

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.040
Looks like it will happen here.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:26.640


00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.380
So, see, when I'm at the minimum,

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.480
the two gradient vectors are parallel.

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:35.400
That's not really a proof.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.260
It's an example, but seems to be convincing.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.100
So far, things work pretty well.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.780
Okay, so how do we decide if two vectors are parallel?

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:48.520
Well, they're parallel when they're proportional

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:49.180
to each other.

00:11:54.880 --> 00:12:00.260
So, you can write one of them as a constant times the other one.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.900
And that constant usually when uses the Greek letter lambda.

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:08.000
Okay, I don't know if you've seen it before.

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:09.280
It's the Greek letter for L.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:14.940
And probably, I'm sure that somebody's idea

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:16.260
of paying a tribute to Lagrange,

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:17.760
by putting an L in there.

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:24.460
Okay, so lambda is just a constant.

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:27.960
And we are looking for a scalar lambda

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:31.100
and points x and y where this holds.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.800
So, in fact, what we are doing is we are replacing

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:37.980
a minmax problem in two variables

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.700
with a constraint between them

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.740
by a set of equations involving,

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:44.200
you will see three variables.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:50.760
So, we had minmax with two variables,

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.340
x and y, but not independent.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.340
We had a constraint, g of x, y equals constant.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:05.860
And that becomes something new,

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.900
that becomes a system of equations.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.180
Where we have to solve, well,

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:21.320
so let's write down what it means for gradient f

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.980
to be proportional to gradient g.

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:28.720
That means that f sub x should be lambda times g sub x.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.880
And f sub y should be lambda times g sub y.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:37.900
Because the gradient vectors here are f sub x, f sub y

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.520
and g sub x, g sub y.

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:42.380
If you have a third variable z,

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:47.100
then you have also an equation f sub z equals lambda g sub z.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.020
Now, let's see, how many unknowns do we have in these equations?

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:57.980
Well, there's x, there's y, and there's lambda.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:13:59.840
So we have three unknowns.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.400
We have only two equations, something's missing.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:09.460
Well, yeah, I mean, x and y are not actually independent,

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:13.700
they're related by the equation g of x, y equals c.

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:20.760
So we need to add the constraint g equals c.

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:24.480
And now we have three equations involving three variables.

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:27.800
Okay, let's see how that works.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:38.880
So here, remember, we have f equals x squared plus y squared.

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:41.360
And g equals x y.

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.300
Okay, so what's f sub x?

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:53.020
That's going to be two x equals lambda times what is g sub x y?

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:58.920
Okay, so maybe I should write here f sub x equals lambda g sub x

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:05.180
just to remind you, then we have f sub y equals lambda g sub y.

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:12.780
So f sub y is two y equals lambda times g sub y is x.

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:20.460
And then our third equation g equals c becomes x y equals three.

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:23.800
Okay, so that's what we would have to solve.

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:27.620
Okay, any questions at this point?

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:32.760
No?

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:33.720
Yes?

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:36.320
How do I know the direction of the gradient?

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:40.060
Or the two dimensional curve?

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.180
How do I know the direction of the gradient?

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:47.060
Do you mean, how do I know that it's perpendicular to the level curve?

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.380
Yeah, I know the point in this gradient.

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:54.140
Oh, how do I know whether it points in that direction on the opposite one?

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.500
Well, that depends, I mean, we've seen actually last time

00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.640
that the gradient is perpendicular to the level

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:02.000
and points towards higher values of a function.

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:06.180
So it could be, what did I have them?

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.160
Yeah, it could be that my gradient vectors are there,

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.040
actually pointing opposite directions.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.820
It doesn't matter to me because it will still look the same

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:17.980
in terms of the equation, just lambda will be positive or negative

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:18.940
depending on the case.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.860
Okay, so I can handle both situations, it's not a problem.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:30.640
So yeah, I can allow lambda to be positive or negative.

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:35.260
And well, in this example, it looks like lambda will be positive

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.820
if you look at the picture on the plot.

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:38.560
Yes?

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:42.820
If you're trying to find sort of an overlap and circles,

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.820
in a second, why can't you set the two points equal to the level?

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.020
Well, because actually they're not equal to each other.

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:52.600
If you look at, you know, so if you look at this point

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.980
where the hyperbola and the circle touch each other,

00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:59.360
so first of all, I don't know which circle I'm going to look at.

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:03.760
I'm trying to solve, actually, for the radius of the circle.

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:05.800
I'm trying to find what's the minimum value of f.

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:10.860
And second, at that value of f, actually, at that point,

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:13.440
the value of f and the value of g are not equal.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:17.120
g is equal to free because I'm on the hyperbola x equals free.

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:20.700
The value of f will be the square of a distance, whatever that is.

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:24.440
I think it will end up being six, but we'll see.

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.920
Okay, so you can't really set them equal

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.840
because you don't know what f is equal to in advance.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:30.900
Yes?

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:46.260
Not quite.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:47.100
No, we are not.

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:51.400
So, I mean, actually here, I'm just using this idea of finding a point

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:54.840
closest to the origin to illustrate an example of a min-max problem.

00:17:54.840 --> 00:18:00.600
The general problem that I'm trying to solve is minimize f subject to g equals constant.

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:05.240
And what we are going to do for that is we're really going to say, instead,

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:09.960
let's look at places where gradient f and gradient g are parallel to each other

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.480
and solve for equations of that.

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:15.560
I think we completely lose the notion of closest point.

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:21.100
If we just look at these equations, we don't really say anything about closest points anymore.

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:22.880
Of course, that's what they mean in the end.

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:27.440
But in the general setting, there's no closest point involved anymore.

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:29.220
Just that.

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:31.120
Yes?

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:47.740
Yes, so it's always going to be the case that at the minimum or at the maximum of the function subject to a constraint,

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.420
the level curves of f and the level curves of g will be tangent to each other.

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:53.060
So that's the basis for this method.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:55.460
So I'm going to justify that soon.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:58.340
So yes, it could be minimum or maximum.

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.560
Or in three dimensions, it could even be a saddle point.

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:06.340
And in fact, I should say in advance, this method will not tell us whether it's a minimum or a maximum.

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.560
We don't have any way of knowing, except for testing values.

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.960
We can't use second derivative test or anything like that.

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.020
Okay, I'll get back to that.

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:17.360
Yes?

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.220
I think we can set y equals to 0.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.200
Yes, here you can set y equals to 3 over x.

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:27.200
And then you can minimize x squared plus 9 over x squared.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:32.860
In general, if I'm trying to solve a more complicated problem, I might not be able to solve.

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:37.380
Okay, so I'm doing an example where, indeed, here you could solve and remove one variable.

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:39.380
But you can't always do that.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.080
And this method will still work.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:42.020
The other one won't.

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:43.760
Okay?

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:49.940
I don't see any other questions.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.240
Are there any other questions?

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:57.720
Okay, then I see a lot of us that is stretching and so on.

00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:59.460
So it's very confusing for me.

00:19:59.640 --> 00:19:59.640


00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:03.180
Okay.

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.240
So how do we solve these equations?

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:11.040
Well, the answer is in general, we might be in deep trouble.

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:12.980
Okay?

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:18.360
There's no general method for solving the equations that you get from this method.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.620
You just have to think about them.

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:23.820
And so, you know, sometimes it will be very easy.

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:28.440
Sometimes it will be so hard that you can't actually do it without a computer.

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:32.820
Sometimes it will be just hard enough to be on part B of this week's problem set.

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:46.640
Okay.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:54.740
So in this case, I claim in this case we can actually do it without so much trouble.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:56.060
Okay?

00:20:56.060 --> 00:21:05.660
Because actually we can think of this as a 2 by 2 linear system in x and y.

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:07.820
Well, let me do something.

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:09.320
Okay?

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:16.980
So let me rewrite the first two equations as 2x minus lambda y equals 0.

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:23.900
And lambda x minus 2y equals 0.

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:23.900


00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:27.700
And xy equals 3.

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.180
Right?

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:31.360
That's what we want to solve.

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:46.680
Well, I can put this into matrix form 2 minus lambda lambda minus 2 times xy equals 0.

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:49.940
Now, how do I solve linear system?

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.420
Matrix times xy equals 0.

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:52.420


00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.360
Well, I always have an obvious solution.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:55.000


00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:56.440
x and y both equal to 0.

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:57.380
Is that a good solution?

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.420
No, because 0 times 0 is not free.

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:02.000
Okay?

00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:03.860
So we want another solution.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:19.500
So the trivial solution, 0, 0 does not solve the constraint equation xy equals 3.

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:19.500


00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:21.100
So we want another solution.

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.200
When do we have another solution?

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:27.680
Well, when the determinant of a matrix is 0.

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:29.580
Okay?

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.560
So we have other solutions.

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:45.020
Exist only if the determinant of a matrix is 0.

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:48.280
And where m is is gay.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:50.360
Okay?

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:52.320
So let's compute the determinant.

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:05.780
Well, that seems to be negative 4 plus lambda squared.

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:15.760
So that's 0 exactly 1 lambda squared equals 4, which is lambda is plus or minus 2.

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:17.840
Okay?

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:29.540
So already you see here it's at a level of difficulty that's a little bit much for an exam, but perfectly fine for a problem set or for a beautiful lecture like this one.

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:30.780
Okay?

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:39.080
So how do we deal with, well, we have two cases to look at lambda equals 2 or lambda equals minus 2.

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:41.960
Let's start with lambda equals 2.

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:46.500
If I set lambda equals 2, what does this equation become?

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:48.700
Well, it becomes x equals y.

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:51.940
This one becomes y equals x.

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:54.540
Well, they seem to be the same.

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:54.960
Okay?

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:55.880
x equals y.

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:02.400
And then the equation xy equals 3 becomes, well, x squared equals 3.

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:05.040
So I have two solutions.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.960
One is x equals root 3.

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:11.440
And therefore, what y equals root 3 as well?

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:16.780
Or negative root 3.

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:18.100
Negative root 3.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:20.860
Okay?

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.840
Let's look at the other case.

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:30.500
Well, if I set lambda equal to negative 2, then I get 2x equals negative 2y.

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:33.420
That means x equals negative y.

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:39.200
The second one, 2y equals negative 2x.

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:40.500
That's y equals negative x.

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:41.620
Well, that's the same thing.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:48.360
And xy equals 3 becomes, well, negative x squared equals 3.

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:50.600
Can we solve that?

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:51.460
No.

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:52.440
Okay?

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.620
So there's no solutions here.

00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:02.220
So now we have two candidate points, which are these two points.

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:06.460
Root 3, root 3, or negative root 3, negative root 3.

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:10.360
Okay.

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:15.120
So let's actually look at what we have here.

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:22.200
Well, maybe you can trade the coordinates, but actually the point that I have here is indeed root 3, root 3.

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:25.800
And how do we see that lambda equals 2?

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:33.240
Well, if you look at this picture, the gradient of f, that's the blue vector, is indeed twice the yellow vector, gradient g.

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:35.300
Okay, that's where you read the value of lambda.

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:37.360
Okay.

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:41.860
And we have the other solution, which is somewhere here.

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.100
Negative root 3, negative root 3.

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:49.460
And there, again, lambda equals 2.

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:51.880
The two vectors are proportional by a factor of 2.

00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:54.120
Yes?

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:58.180
So if we get a gradient, it's equal to?

00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:01.800
No, solutions are not quite guaranteed to be absolute minimum or maximum.

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:06.040
They're guaranteed to be somehow critical points under the constraint.

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:09.700
So that means, you know, if you were able to solve and eliminate the variables, they would be critical points.

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:14.260
So then you have the same problem as with critical points, of a maximum or minimum.

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:17.320
And the answer is, well, we won't know until we check.

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:23.180
Okay.

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:26.080
More questions?

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:29.580
No. Yes?

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.660
So what is a log-range multiplier?

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:36.000
Well, it's this number lambda.

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:37.340
It's called the multiplier here.

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:37.820
Okay.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:43.980
It's multiplier because it's what you have to multiply in gradient of g by to get gradient of f.

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:48.840
You know, it multiplies.

00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:57.240
Okay.

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:57.240


00:26:59.280 --> 00:26:59.620
Okay.

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:09.960
So let's try to see why is this method valid?

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:19.820
Because, you know, so far, I've shown you pictures and I've said, well, see, they're tangent.

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:22.340
But why is it that they have to be tangent in general?

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:24.260
Okay.

00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:27.940
So let's think about it.

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:32.680
Let's say that we are at a constraint min or max.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:44.820
So what that means is that if I move on the level g equals constant, then the value of f

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:46.660
Food only increase or only decrease.

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:50.060
But it means in particular to first order, it will not change.

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:51.240
Okay.

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:53.880
That's the, you know, that's.

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:57.160
So at an unconstrained min or max, the partial derivatives are zero.

00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:01.860
In this case, the derivatives are zero only in the allowed directions.

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:07.200
And the allowed directions are those that stay on the level surface g equals constant.

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:09.660
Okay.

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:30.260
So in any direction, along the level set g equals c, the rate of change of f

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:36.480
Must be zero.

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:40.200
Okay.

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:43.440
That's what happens at min or max.

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:46.580
Except here, of course, we look only at the allowed directions.

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:51.640
Okay.

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:56.220
So let's say the same thing in terms of directional derivatives.

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:25.080
So that means for

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:43.260
any direction that's tangent to the constraint level g equals c, we must have

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:53.020
the f ds in the direction of u equals zero.

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:54.840


00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:57.260
Maybe draw a picture.

00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:02.720
So let's say now I'm in free variables just to, you know, give you different

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:05.400
examples.

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:09.140
So here I have the level surface g equals c.

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:11.220
I'm at my point.

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:19.900
And if I move in any direction that's on the level surface, so I move in the direction u

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:26.220
that's tangent to the level surface, then the rate of change of f in that direction should be zero.

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:26.220


00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:34.120
Now remember what's the formula for this guy?

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:39.620
Well, we've seen that this guy is actually gradient f dot u.

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:49.860
So that means any such vector u must be perpendicular to the gradient of f.

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:09.900
Well, so that means that the gradient of f should be perpendicular to anything that's tangent to this level.

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:14.600
So that means the gradient of f should be perpendicular to the level set.

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:16.280
That's what we've shown.

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:42.440
But we know another vector that's also perpendicular to the level set of g that's the gradient of g.

00:31:55.860 --> 00:32:03.900
So we conclude that the gradient of f must be parallel to the gradient of g because both are perpendicular to the level set of g.

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:09.220
I see confused faces.

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.740
So let me try to tell you again where that comes from.

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:17.840
So we said if we have a constant minimum or maximum, if we move in the level set of g, f doesn't change.

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:20.240
Well, it doesn't change to first order.

00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:25.080
Remember, it's the same idea as when you're looking for a minimum, you set the derivative equal to zero.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:36.540
So the derivative in any direction tangent to g equals c should be the directional derivative of f in any such direction should be zero.

00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:41.620
That's what we mean by a critical point of f.

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:55.960
And so that means that any vector you had, any unit vector tangent to the level set of g is going to be perpendicular to the gradient of f.

00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:02.300
So that means that the gradient of f is perpendicular to the level set of g.

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:07.220
If you want that means the level sets of f and g are tangent to each other.

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:17.360
So that's justifying what we've observed on the picture, but the two level sets have to be tangent to each other at the constraint minimum or maximum.

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:21.460
Does that make a little bit of sense?

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:25.100
I see at least a few faces, nothing.

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:30.260
So I'll take that for, and take that to be a positive answer.

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:42.300
Okay. So since I've been asked by several of you, how do I know if it's a maximum or a minimum?

00:33:42.300 --> 00:34:02.820
Well, warning, the method doesn't tell whether a solution is a minimum or a maximum.

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:11.380
Okay. So how do we do it? Well, more bad news.

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:15.200
We can't use the second derivative test.

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:33.400
And the reason for that is that we care actually only about these specific directions that are tangent to the level of g.

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:41.600
And we don't really, I mean, we don't want to bother to try to define directional second derivatives, not to mention that actually it wouldn't work.

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:45.120
There is a criterion, but it's much more complicated than that.

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:51.560
So basically the answer for us is we don't have a second derivative test in this situation.

00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:55.820
So what are we left with? Well, we're just left with comparing values.

00:34:56.580 --> 00:35:03.240
You know, say that in this problem, you found a point where f equals three, a point where f equals nine, a point where f equals 15.

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:09.120
Well, then probably the minimum is the point where f equals three, and the maximum is 15.

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:16.560
Actually, in this case, well, we found minimum, you know, these two points are tied for minimum.

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.520
What about the maximum? What's the maximum of f from the hyperbola?

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:25.680
Well, it's infinity because the, you know, the point can go as far as you want from the origin.

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:37.500
So, but the general idea is if we have a good reason to believe that there should be a minimum, and you know, that it's not like at infinity or something we are like that,

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:42.680
then the minimum will be a solution of the Lagrange multiplier equations.

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:47.180
So we just look for all the solutions, and then we choose the one that gives us the lowest value.

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:50.600
Is that good enough?

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:57.000
Okay. So let me actually write that down just.

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:26.320
So, to find the minimum of the maximum,

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:47.720
we compare the values of f at the various solutions to the Lagrange multiplier equations.

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:53.580
Okay.

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:12.480
Okay. Let's do, well, sorry, I should say also, sometimes you can just conclude, you know, by thinking geometrically.

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:18.620
Okay. I mean, in this case, you know, when it's asking you which point is closest to the origin, you can just see that your answer is the correct one.

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:26.280
Okay. Let's do an advanced example.

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:37.240
Okay. Advanced means that, well, this one I didn't actually dare to put on part B of a problem set.

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:39.960
So it's then going to do it.

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:48.800
Okay. So, what is this going to be about?

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:51.920
We're going to look for a surface minimizing pyramid.

00:37:52.360 --> 00:38:07.220
Okay. So, let's say that we want to build a pyramid with a

00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:17.220
given triangular base and a given volume.

00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:31.720
And so, say that, you know, I have maybe in the xy plane, I'm giving you some triangle.

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:42.280
And I'm going to try to build a pyramid. So, I have to find where to put, because I can choose where to put the top of a pyramid.

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:49.400
Okay. This guy will end up being behind now.

00:38:52.960 --> 00:39:00.940
And the constraint and the goal is to minimize the total surface area.

00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:15.620
Okay. So, first time I told this class that was like a few years ago, it was just before they built the status center.

00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:19.840
And then I used to motivate this problem by saying, well, Frankere has gone crazy.

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:22.960
And he's given a triangular plot of land. He wants to put a pyramid.

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:30.120
And he wants to put all the offices in there. And he wants it to be covered in solid gold.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.260
And because that's expensive, the MIT administration wants him to cut the costs a bit.

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:39.900
And so, you have to minimize the total size. So, that it doesn't cost too much.

00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:46.040
We'll see if MIT comes up with a triangular pyramid building. Hopefully not.

00:39:46.040 --> 00:40:00.220
But it could be our next dome in the tunnel. Okay. Anyway, it's a fine geometry problem.

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:05.040
And let's try to think about how we can do this.

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:11.460
So, the natural way to think about it would be, well, what we have to look for first.

00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:15.400
What do we have to look for? We have to look for the position of that top point.

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:29.900
Well, remember we know that the volume of a pyramid is 1 third of area of the base times height.

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:38.820
Okay. So, in fact, fixing the volume, knowing that we have fixed the area of the base,

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:42.820
means that we're fixing the height of the pyramid. Okay.

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:49.120
So, the height is completely fixed. What we have to choose just is where do we put that top point?

00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:55.280
Do we put it smack in the middle of the triangle or to a side or even, you know, anywhere we want?

00:40:55.280 --> 00:41:10.320
But, it's z coordinate is fixed. Okay. Let's call h-right.

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:19.900
So, what we could do is something like this.

00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:34.760
We say, well, we have three points in the base. Let's call them p1 at x1 y1 0, p2 at x2 y2 0, p3 at x3 y3 0.

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:41.120
This point p is the unknown point at x, y, h. Well, at least we know the height.

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:50.540
And then we want to minimize the sum of the areas of these three triangles that are, you know, one here, one here, and one at the back.

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:56.340
And areas of triangles, we know how to express using lengths of cross-product.

00:41:57.140 --> 00:42:03.540
So, that becomes a function of x and y. And you can try to minimize it. And actually, it doesn't quite work.

00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:05.860
The formulas are just too complicated. You never get there.

00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:15.040
So, what happens is actually, maybe we need better coordinates.

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:23.400
Why do we need better coordinates? That's because the geometry is kind of difficult to do if you use x, y coordinates.

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:28.740
I mean, formula for cross-product is fine, but then the length of a vector will be annoying.

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:37.540
And just doesn't look good. So, instead, let's think about it differently.

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:39.860
Oh, I have one more build.

00:42:52.200 --> 00:43:07.520
Okay, so if I claim if we do it this way, you know, and we express then the area as a function of x, y, well, actually we can solve for minimum for the minimum.

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:18.200
So, here's another way to do it. Well, what's worked pretty well for us so far is this geometric idea of, you know, base times height.

00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:25.740
So, let's think in terms of the heights of this side triangles.

00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:32.980
Okay, so I'm going to use the heights of these things.

00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:47.760
And I'm going to say that the area will be the sum of three terms, which are three basis and three heights.

00:43:47.760 --> 00:44:00.900
So, let's give names to these quantities. So, to do for that, it's going to be good to have the point in the x, y plane that lives directly below p.

00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:13.480
Let's call q. So, p is the point that coordinates x, y, and h. And let's call q, the point that's just below it. So, it coordinates x, y, zero.

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:26.980
Okay, so let's see. Let me draw a picture actually. Let me draw a map, you know, of this thing. See it from above.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:34.180
So, you have p1, p2, p3. I have my point q in the middle.

00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:45.840
So, let's see, to know these areas, I need to know the base. Well, the base, I can decide that I know it because it's part of my given data.

00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:57.820
I know the size of this triangle that we call the length a1, a2, a3. I also need to know the height. So, I need to know these lengths.

00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:09.260
How do I know these lengths? Well, it's a distance in space, but it's a little bit annoying. But maybe I can reduce it to a distance in the plane by looking instead at this distance here.

00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:34.640
Okay, so let me give names to the distances from q to the size. Okay, so let's call u1, u2, and u3 for distances from q to the size.

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:59.520
Well, now I claim I can find, actually, sorry, I need to draw one more thing. I claim I have a nice formula for the area because this side here, so this is vertical and that's horizontal.

00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:20.880
So, this length here is u3, this length here is h. So, what's this length here? Yeah, it's square root of u3 squared plus h squared. And similarly for these other guys, they're square root of u squared plus h squared.

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:39.060
Okay, so the height of the faces are square root of u1 squared plus h squared, and similarly with u2 and u3.

00:46:39.060 --> 00:47:02.600
So, the total side area is going to be, well, area of the first faces, 1 half of base times height plus 1 half of over base times over height plus 1 half of third one.

00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:23.280
It doesn't look so much better, but trust me, it will get better. Okay, so now that's a function of three variables, u1, u2, u3. And how do we relate u1, u2, u3 to each other? They're probably not independent.

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:43.260
Well, let's cut this triangle here into three pieces, like that. Then each piece has side, well, let's look at, say, the piece at the bottom, it has base a3 height u3.

00:47:43.260 --> 00:48:06.900
So, cut the base into three tells you that the area of the base is 1 half of a1 u1 plus 1 half of a2 u2 plus 1 half of a3 u3. And that's now constraint.

00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:21.880
Okay, so my three variables u1, u2, u3 are constrained in this way. The sum of these three guys must be the area of the base, and I want to minimize that guy. So, that's my g. Okay, and that guy here is my f.

00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:46.760
So, now if I find the Lagrange multiplier equations, well, partial f of a partial u1 is, well, if you do the calculation, you will see it's 1 half a1 u1 of a square root of u1 square plus h square, should be lambda times what's partial g partial u1, that's what you can do in show.

00:48:46.760 --> 00:49:10.760
So, it's 1 half a1. Oh, this guy is simplified. Okay, if you do the same with the second one, things simplify again. And same with the third one.

00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:28.360
Well, you will get, after simplifying, u3 of a square root of u3 square plus h square equals lambda. So, now that means this guy equals this guy equals this guy. They're all equal to lambda.

00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:40.320
And if you think about it, that means that u1 equals u2 equals u3. See, it looked like scary equations, but the solution is very simple.

00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:51.420
So, what does it mean? It means that our point q should be equidistant from all three sides. That's called the in center. So, q should be the in center.

00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:57.300
So, the next time that you have to build a golden pyramid and don't want to go broke, well, you know where to put the top.

00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:07.940
Okay, if that was a bit fast, sorry, anyway, it's not completely cross-hole, but, you know, go over it, you will see it works. Have a nice weekend.
